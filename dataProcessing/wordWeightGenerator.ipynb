The region , after all , ha had to deal with roll debt crise , terrorist attack , an influx of refuge and migrant , and the possibl that Britain may vote to leav the European Union .Then there is Spain . Across Europ , econom growth ha help bring the unemploy rate down . But in Spain , the rate is 20 percent , accord to European Union survey , and ha been abov that level for over five year , even as the country economi ha been recov .Youd be forgiven for think that such a high level of jobless , weigh on famili for so long , would have caus the countri to crack by now . The jobless number is so much higher than the rate for other econom laggard like Itali ( 11 percent ) and Portug ( 12 percent ) .Certainli , some of Spain unemploy is overst becaus some worker have off-the-book job . And peopl may feel optimist becaus unemploy ha fallen in recent quarter , from 25 percent two year ago .Still , Spanish offici recent said they did not expect the jobless rate to fall below 15 percent until 2019 . And there the matter of the country youth unemploy ( those under 25 ) : an almost incomprehens 45.5 percent .A new govern in Spain  onc it is chosen after almost half a year of discord  may end up pursu smarter and bolder polici that reduc jobless to level that exist elsewher in Europ .But the chanc of that look slim .Spain unemploy is so high partli becaus of particular local forc that have exist for decad . Marcel Jansen , an expert on labor market at the Universidad Autnoma de Madrid , note that unemploy abov 20 percent is not uncommon in Spain . In fact , it ha been at that level in three period sinc Spain transit to democraci in the 1970 . And , omin , from the previou unemploy rate peak in the 1990 , it took 14 year for it to declin to the wider European level , Mr. Jansen note .One caus of the high rate becam embed in Spain labor market over the last 40 year . A signific proport of Spain worker emerg from the dictatorship year with ironclad job secur . Mani of those protect remain , Mr. Jansen said , but much of the new hire in the democrat era took place through temporari employ contract . Just befor the 2008 financi crisi , around a third of Spain worker were on temporari contract , far higher than the European averag .When the crisi hit , it wa veri easi to lay off the temporari worker . True , dure the recent recoveri , the high use of temporari contract ha most like spur Spanish firm to bolster their hire . But the persist of overli protect labor contract alongsid temporari one with too few protect ha probabl also creat ineffici within Spanish compani that have dampen econom growth .Mr. Jansen prefer solut is to introduc a new contract that could increas protect for temporari worker and loosen them for mani perman worker . But he said Spain politician had shown littl support for thi idea .Someth els is make matter wors right now . Much of Spain working-ag popul doe not have an educ beyond high school . And mani of those peopl have remain unemploy for multipl year after the financi crisi of 2008 . ( Nearli a fourth of the unemploy have been without work for four year or more . )Such worker are increasingli lose contact with the industri they work in , and that will make it even harder for them to find job . And hire in Spain construct industri , a big employ befor the crisi , is not like to return to precrisi level anytim soon . Mr. Jansen say help the long-term unemploy requir a substanti overhaul of Spain retrain program . But thi cost money , and Spain ha one of the largest budget deficit in Europ .Thi is where we bump into the big econom debat that loom over the Contin . On one side are those who insist that struggl countri must pursu polici that cut govern spend and free up market , to spur strong and sustain growth . As we have learn , Spain labor market could certainli do with some big chang . But as we have also seen , these chang are far from immin . They are expens . They threaten entrench interest . Spain leader are so divid that they cant form an administr that could attempt bold move .Economist on the other side of the debat emphas the need for the European Union as a whole to come togeth to introduc big top-down action . Such polici includ debt forgiv and far greater fiscal stimulu . Spain sky-high unemploy ha not move Europe leader to take such step by now . Then again , Europ cant count on Spain  or ani countri  to toler thi high level of jobless forev .', 'The French drug compani Sanofi said on Thursday that it had made a nonbind offer to acquir the prostat cancer drug maker Mediv for about $ 9.3 billion in cash .Sanofi , base in Pari , publicli announc the offer on Thursday after it said that Mediv , a San Francisco biotechnolog compani , had not respond to a letter Sanofi sent nearli two week ago offer to acquir the compani . Sanofi , which ha been suffer from declin in sale of it main diabet drug , ha said it is interest in make medium-s acquisit . Analyst describ the company exist portfolio as weak .Under the term of it offer , Sanofi said on Thursday that it wa will to pay $ 52.50 a share for Mediv , the maker of the prostat cancer therapi Xtandi . That would repres a premium of more than 50 percent over Medivation two-month volume-weight averag share price befor takeov rumor , Sanofi said .Share of Mediv close on Wednesday at $ 52.05 .Last Novemb , Sanofi outlin our midterm strategi , which includ rebuild our posit in oncolog , one of the largest and fastest-grow therapeut area in the biopharmaceut sector ,  Olivi Brandicourt , the Sanofi chief execut , said in a news releas .With Medivation best-in-class offer in prostat cancer , we believ a combin would benefit patient and , at the same time , gener valu for sharehold of both compani ,  he ad .In a separ letter to Mediv on Thursday , Sanofi said that it first discuss a possibl takeov in a phone call with David T. Hung , Medivation chief execut , on March 25 and in a subsequ convers on April 3 .Mediv express no interest in discuss a transact at the time , and Sanofi sent a letter on April 15 offer to pay $ 52.50 a share for the compani , Sanofi said .Mediv ha not respond other than to acknowledg the letter receipt , Sanofi said .We do not understand the delay in respond to our letter ,  Mr. Brandicourt said on Thursday . The price we put forth repres a veri substanti premium , and it would be all cash without ani financ condit . In these circumst we believ it is appropri to make thi letter public , which we are do today.Mediv said on Thursday that it board began an evalu of the Sanofi propos with it independ financi and legal advis when it wa contact by Sanofi on April 15 .The compani said that it expect the board to complet the review at a meet on Thursday and it would provid an updat promptli thereafter.There are no assur that a transact will be reach or on what term ,  Mediv said in a news releas . Mediv stockhold are advis to take no action at thi time.Mr. Brandicourt , who took over as chief execut last year after Christoph A. Viehbach wa abruptli oust , ha said that Sanofi is interest in medium-s acquisit , and that cancer treatment is an area of interest .Sanofi alreadi sell two drug to treat prostat cancer : Taxoter , also known as docetaxel , which now face competit from gener , and the newer Jevtana . But both are consid chemotherapi , with the attend side effect , and mani men with the diseas prefer other drug .Over all , Sanofi portfolio of market cancer drug is weak and popul by undifferenti also-ran ,  Timothi Anderson , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein , wrote in a note on Thursday .Xtandi is among the fairli new , so-cal target drug that are not consid chemotherapi and that have been shown in clinic trial to extend the live of men with advanc prostat cancer . The drug , market by the Japanes compani Astella Pharma , had global sale last year of $ 1.9 billion , with Medivation share at $ 943 million .Sale could grow if the compani succe in win approv for the drug use in earlier stage of prostat cancer . But it face competit from Zytiga , made by Johnson & Johnson , and possibl from agent under develop .Xtandi ha alreadi provid a windfal for the Univers of California , Lo Angel as the develop of the drug wa base on discoveri by campu research . In March , U.C.L.A . sold it right to futur royalti from the drug to the invest firm Royalti Pharma , for $ 1.14 billion in cash and potenti addit payment base on Xtandi sale . U.C.L.A . will retain $ 520 million of that . The rest will go to the research and to the Howard Hugh Medic Institut , which financi support the research .Xtandi , howev , ha also becom one of the latest symbol of the controversi over high drug price . Two activist group have ask the feder govern to essenti pre-empt Medivation exclus patent right and allow other compani to manufactur the product to lower price . Some member of Congress , includ Senat Berni Sander of Vermont , are also press the Obama administr to consid thi .The feder govern ha so-cal march-in right becaus taxpay help pay for the drug develop , in thi case through research fund from the Nation Institut of Health and the Depart of Defens . Under feder law , the govern can exercis it right to patent if the benefit of a feder fund invent are not made avail to the public on reason terms.The activist group , Knowledg Ecolog Intern and the Union for Afford Cancer Treatment say that Xtandi meet thi criterion becaus of it high price . The drug ha a wholesal list price in the Unit State of about $ 88 a capsul , or $ 129,000 for a year of treatment , the group say , two to four time the price in other high-incom countri .In the past , howev , the Nation Institut of Health ha declin to exercis such march-in right mere becaus a drug is expens , say that they were not an appropri mean of control price .', 'A buy spree by a Chines insur compani that ha emerg seemingli overnight is flash a warn sign .An allianc led by the Chines compani , the Anbang Insur Group , ha for the moment been outbid for Starwood Hotel & Resort , the owner of the Sheraton and Westin brand , by Marriott Intern . But that Anbang is even in the run  and may yet win out  is an indic of deal-mak gone awri .Typic in a takeov battl , a strateg bidder should alway triumph over a financi bidder like a privat equiti firm or Anbang , which ha team up with two invest firm .The reason is simpl . A strateg buyer is an oper compani and almost alway can pay more for a target . The strateg buyer can expect to earn more from the target through cost save . There would be no need for two gener counsel , for exampl .A strateg buyer should also be abl to reap oper effici or other benefit from put two asset togeth  what deal maker call synergies. Think of the Walt Disney Compani buy Marvel Entertain to put the Marvel charact in Disney movi and theme park . Thi sort of strateg rational is what is drive Marriott bid .The last time financi buyer regularli beat out strateg buyer wa in the month befor the financi crisi as the credit bubbl drove a huge privat equiti feed frenzi . In those day , Kohlberg Kravi Robert and Compani could acquir First Data for $ 29 billion , borrow more than the compani wa worth the day befor the deal announc .Anbang also announc deal for the Waldorf Astoria in Octob 2014 for $ 1.95 billion , 717 Fifth Avenu in Februari 2015 for an estim $ 500 million and Strateg Hotel & Resort for $ 6.5 billion from Blackston onli two week ago . Blackston bought the compani for $ 500 million less onli three month ago . It a nice deal for Blackston , but one wonder whi Anbang would pay so much more onli a few month later .So what give with all the hotel acquisit ?Anbang , which wa found in 2004 , appear to be tri to build itself into a financi conglomer along the line of Warren E. Buffett Berkshir Hathaway . Like Berkshir , Anbang is use insur reserv to buy asset in a varieti of busi such as bank and real estat . It also spent over $ 2 billion on insur in Belgium and South Korea in 2015 .And Anbang is fund thi spree by sell high-yield invest product to Chines citizen .If thi type of compani exist in the Unit State , there would be an outcri . It may be reason for an Internet compani to appear out of nowher and be a giant after 10 year , but an insur compani ? And one that is buy noncor asset abundantli ? Wev seen thi stori mani time befor , and it typic doesnt end well .But a huge hunger for growth doesnt quit explain Anbang attempt to buy more than $ 20 billion worth of hotel properti in the space of a year or so . There are the polit connect , of cours . Anbang deal-mak chairman , Wu Xiaohui , is said to enjoy warm relat with the Beij govern . Hi wife is the granddaught of Deng Xiaop , the former leader of China .The company explan is that it is diversifi . It appear to view global real estat as a high-yield asset that will allow the compani to diversifi it asset out of China at a time when China economi is slow . Thi is particularli import for a life insur , sinc China popul is age rapidli , so higher return are a must .It is easi to compar the shop spree by Anbang and other Chines compani to the shop by Japanes compani in the 1980 . Back then , the emerg giant of Japan sought out trophi properti in the Unit State , includ Rockefel Center . The Japanes mostli bought at the top and then suffer through the downturn in the earli 1990 . Given the price of commerci real estat these day , as well as the price Anbang paid for the Waldorf Astoria  a record for a hotel in New York  one ha to think that thi might be the case again .But acquir Starwood is even a step further afield . In the case of the Waldorf , Anbang enter into a 100-year contract with Hilton to manag the properti .But who would manag Starwood ? Anbang ha partner with the privat equiti firm J. C. Flower & Compani and the Primavera Capit Group . J. C. Flower special in acquisit in the financi servic industri . Primavera is a Chines privat equiti firm . Neither appear to have much hotel experi .Given the state of the hotel industri  with Airbnb shake up the world  it is hard to see where Anbang would get the necessari experi . One suppos the life insur could keep on the Starwood team , but Anbang ha alreadi had troubl manag it new non-Chines subsidiari .In the case of Anbang Belgian acquisit , the manag team left after a few month amid complaint of Anbang manag style .None of thi justifi outbid Marriott , which ha more experi and can reap more save from Starwood .Instead , thi is probabl just a grand currenc play . Anbang is will to overpay becaus it is convert Chines currenc . As the world know , there are expect that there will be a further devalu of the Chines currenc , the renminbi . By move it money out of China , Anbang can hedg against such a downturn .Anbang also buy further protect from interfer by Beij author . So even though there is a slow-mot flight of dollar leav China that Beij is tri to halt , Anbang is probabl tri to get more dollar out . After all , if there is a devalu , thi will benefit everyon in China , at least .Anbang may have now push too far on thi front . Caixin , a Chines busi public , ha report that insur regul in China are said to be prepar to block the bid for both Starwood and Strateg Hotel & Resort , becaus they would violat rule prohibit insur from invest more than 15 percent of their asset abroad . Well see how these polit play out .Should Anbang persever and come out the winner in the bid for Starwood , there will certainli be talk about nation secur and the review process by the Council on Foreign Invest in the Unit State . Thi will be akin to the review over Smithfield when it wa bought by Shuanghui Intern Hold . There will be some hand-wring about a Chines buyer , but ultim there will be no issu except perhap some forc sale of hotel near strateg area , like Starwood hotel near the White Hous .But nation secur is not the real issu .The import question is thi : If a 10-year-old opaqu American financi conglomer with no hotel experi were to buy Starwood , fund the transact in part with the sale of high-yield invest product to retail investor , wouldnt that give us paus ?Not onli that , wouldnt we wonder about the futur of Starwood ?One answer is that we wouldnt . Starwood should be sold to the highest bidder , no matter the circumst . But lost in all of thi are the employe and oper of Starwood , and whether Anbang can even capabl run thi compani . Sharehold , meanwhil , includ it two largest sharehold that are activist fund , would probabl just take the money .Perhap the more prudent answer , one our current financi system doesnt address , is that there is too much risk here . The acquisit rais all sort of issu about takeov and the respons to look out for the compani itself .It seem to be a convers worth have .', 'Avi Kaner , a co-own of the Morton William supermarket chain in New York , ha spent about $ 700,000 to updat the payment termin at hi store .Troubl is , he can not turn them on .The new termin can accept credit and debit card with embed digit chip , a secur featur intend to reduc the number of fraudul purchas .But befor the payment system can work , they must be certifi , a process that Mr. Kaner and mani retail around the countri are wait to happen . In the case of Morton William , the holdup ha last sever month .The cost of wait , retail say , is pile up . Until recent , bank cover much of the cost of fraudul purchas . Sinc Oct. 1 , though , merchant that can not accept chip card have had to shoulder the cost of fraud , and bank have not been shi about pass along the bill .It been veri frustrat ,  Mr. Kaner said in an interview last week at hi offic in the Bronx , the home of hi family-own busi . He bought most of the equip he need befor Oct. 1 , he said , and ha been wait month to get it certifi . The delay , he said , point to a tall pile of paperwork , ha cost him thousand of dollar in payment for fraudul purchas .There no recours ,  Mr. Kaner said .The long delay are just the latest black eye for the deploy of the new system . Some consum have not yet receiv new card . Mani merchant have not bought the updat equip . And even when the card and the termin have been updat , they have gener confus and slow line .Mani of the complic were wide predict , but the certif system ha ad an unexpect wrinkl  and lot of finger-point .Bank say that retail wait till the last minut to updat their termin . Retail point to financi tie between the bank and the compani that provid certif , say there is no motiv to move faster .I think there are merchant who should have been prepar and arent ,  said Thad Peterson , a senior analyst with the research firm Ait Group . I think there are merchant who thought they were prepar but arent.For year , retail have argu that the technolog , commonli refer to as E.M.V. , which stand for Europay , MasterCard and Visa , the technology earli advoc , mainli protect bank . Mr. Peterson estim that onli 40 to 50 percent of retail are capabl of accept chip card .Each part of a transact must be certifi , includ the payment hardwar and each payment network , like Visa or MasterCard , that merchant accept . To get certifi , busi work with payment processor like First Data and Vantiv .The whole process , even when it goe smoothli , can take week or month .It is hard to say exactli how mani retail are affect by the delay . First Data , one of the country largest payment processor , said that about 20 percent of the four million American merchant it work with are in the process of be certifi .Complaint have been widespread among midsiz busi  not as small as a mom-and-pop corner store but smaller than a big-box chain .Midsiz merchant have more special need than a store with a singl locat , for exampl , as a bigger busi often need payment softwar tailor to specif loyalti program , inventori or other system . Those tailor system can complic the approv process .That someth Mr. Kaner ha learn the hard way .Theyv delay month after month of provid certif ,  Mr. Kaner said of Vantiv . I ask to speak to their legal depart , and their legal depart basic told me tough luck.Mr. Kaner said it wa difficult to know exactli what wa hold up the process , becaus Vantiv must also work with a merchant softwar vendor and payment hardwar manufactur .In a statement , Vantiv said that the convers to E.M.V . is highli depend on the busi prioriti and timelin of the mani other parti involv in the complex integr process , as wa the case in thi instance.Retail have also point to the financi tie between bank and processor , rais question about whether the compani are inclin to work slowli .Fifth Third Bank own about 18 percent of Vantiv , for exampl . Some of the largest card issuer , like JPMorgan Chase , even have their own payment process unit . Bank of America process arm , Bank of America Merchant Servic , is a joint ventur between the bank and First Data .Payment processor dont have ani incent to hurri the certif along ,  said Patrick J. Coughlin , a lawyer for retail in a recent lawsuit that accus the major card network of deliber creat imposs requir for merchant . Theyr not the one pay the fraud charges.Visa and MasterCard said they were review the lawsuit . American Express said that it believ the charg lack merit and that it plan to defend the case vigorously.MasterCard presid of North America , Craig Vosburg , said that the compani continu to work with parti across the industry to help the transit .Trish Wexler , a spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase , said , If it our fault that our merchant is delay in get a compliant termin , then we absorb chargeback for card-pres fraud dure that time period. A spokesman for Bank of America Merchant Servic declin to comment .Jason Oxman , chief execut of the Electron Transact Associ , a trade group repres the payment industri , dismiss the idea that processor might benefit from delay certif .He said he had not heard of widespread certif delay , and ad that merchant were given plenti of time to prepar for the shift to E.M.V . The transit ha been in the work for sever year , and some of the new payment termin have long been wide avail .Some merchant also deliber wait until after Oct. 1 to begin updat their equip , argu that the deadlin wa just befor the busi holiday shop season .Now , they may just be pay the price .Merchant are start to see counterfeit liabil appear on their statement that theyv never seen befor ,  Mr. Oxman said . And I do think that may be creat some frustration.But Mallori Duncan , gener counsel at the Nation Retail Feder , a trade group , said that the payment industri wa unprepar to handl the flood of request that came in around the Oct. 1 deadlin .They didnt allow for enough time or peopl to perform thi certif ,  Mr. Duncan said . Merchant have gotten slam becaus they werent abl to get certifi , becaus the network fail to provid the necessari resourc to do that.Mr. Kaner , of Morton William , said that sinc Oct. 1 , custom who have contest charg made with E.M.V.-en card have succeed in get mani transact revers  at Morton Williams expens .Mr. Kaner worri that some custom may be use the Oct. 1 liabil shift to get out of pay for legitim purchas . The number of chargeback , he said , ha risen sharpli .It start out as a trickl , and now it turn into a flood ,  he said . In the first coupl month , it might have been a few hundr dollar a month . Now , it thousand a month.', 'Should the govern push poor peopl to marri ?The urg to do so ha a long pedigre , date perhap as far back as 1965 . When serv as a Labor Depart offici in the Johnson administr , Daniel Patrick Moynihan  who wa later a top advis to Presid Richard M. Nixon and ultim one of the most influenti Democrat in Congress as a senat from New York  argu that the surg in African-American famili head by singl mother wa condemn mani black children to fail in school and in life .Promot marriag and two-par famili wa part of Presid Bill Clinton welfar overhaul of 1996 . Hi successor , Georg W. Bush , offer up a Healthi Marriag Initi . The Obama administr polici quiver includ marriag promot , too .And today , when almost 40 percent of new mother are unmarri , when one in five white children , one in four Hispan and one in two black live without a father at home , fix the American famili ha again acquir urgenc across the polit spectrum .Marriag matter ,  proclaim a report publish in Decemb by scholar on the left and right discuss strategi to combat poverti . Marit commit remain the princip foundat upon which most American can build a stabl and secur family.And yet , after all those effort to strengthen the bond between mother and father , husband and wive , it is hard to resist the conclus that much of thi is misdirect , a wast of resourc and time .Birth out of wedlock can be sharpli reduc by provid young women with access to sex educ and long-term contracept , so they might delay have children until they feel readi . And instead of tri hopelessli to reconstitut the convent famili of yore , whi not devot resourc to improv the welfar of the famili as they are ?There no question that children gener do wors in single-par famili . They engag more in riski behavior . They drop out of high school and are more like to end up in the crimin justic system . Research by Raj Chetti of Stanford and other have found that boy live in poor single-moth home are particularli disadvantag later in life .And yet despit year of research to identifi how chang in famili structur hurt children , there is much less agreement on the why.Select is clearli at work : Singl mother and the father of their children are gener less educ than marri parent . They tend to have lesser-pay job and more mental health issu . They would have a tough time rais children in a healthi environ even if they stay togeth .Famili disrupt is not a random event ,  wrote Sara McLanahan of Princeton , Laura Tach of Cornel and Daniel Schneider of the Univers of California , Berkeley , in a studi assess effort to disentangl the effect of select from that of famili structur . The characterist that caus father absenc are like to affect child well-b through other pathways.Then , of cours , there is the issu of resourc . Famili head by singl mother are poorer .Studi in Britain suggest that children in single-par home suffer becaus they are poor , or becaus of the shortcom of their parent  not becaus their parent do not live togeth .Given the evid , marriag promot might even backfir . Encourag a mother to stay with a father who deal in drug , cant hold a job and beat her can actual lead to wors problem for the children , accord to Sara R. Jaffe of the Univers of Pennsylvania .But the strongest case against a polici to deliv strong marriag and stabl famili is that the govern ha no clue how to do that .Rememb the Healthi Marriag Initi ? When MDRC , the polici evalu organ , perform a care evalu of it program of marriag educ for low-incom marri coupl who had or were expect children , it had to conclud that it did not lead more coupl to stay together.Similarli , research at the Nation Center for Famili and Marriag Research at Bowl Green State Univers in Ohio conclud in 2014 that there wa littl to show for the $ 600 million spent on the Healthi Marriag Initi sinc 2001 . Notabl , the divorc rate had not budg and the marriag rate continu to declin .There is good reason to believ that it wa the demis of the solid blue-collar job  squeez out by global and technolog chang  that play the princip role in put an end to the stabl working-class famili . Perhap men with poor job prospect feel unprepar to marri . Perhap women will not marri men who can not provid .What seem clear is that we dont know how to undo that dynam . Most effort to improv the job prospect of less-educ men do littl to increas their chanc of marri .Isabel Sawhil of the Brook Institut suggest we accept that the govern can not bring the stabl two-par famili back . What it can do is encourag more respons parenthood .Six out of 10 children born to singl mother under the age of 30 are unplan , Ms. Sawhil note . They come too soon , when mother have not finish school , befor they have a good job . Offer young women access to effect long-term contracept , research show , would allow them to delay motherhood until they realli want it .Thi sound like a sensibl approach . But there are other option to improv the lot of American famili and children . We just have to look around .Marriag is increasingli unpopular around the industri world . Birth out of wedlock have surg across the board . Yet somehow famili in other rich countri have avoid the depth of dysfunct of their American peer . Thi is not a result of polici encourag marriag . Rather , it is a result of polici aim at increas families and children well-b .In Franc , though marriag declin sharpli over the last two decad , fewer French children than American children are overweight . Fewer French teenag commit suicid . Far fewer French children live in poverti .Part of thi might be becaus of cultur differ . Cohabit out of wedlock is more stabl in Franc . Even though fewer French children than American children live with two marri parent , more live with their mother and father .But cultur can not explain America deficit away . It is critic to keep in mind the role of the French welfar state in foster thi stabil .The French govern devot about 3 percent of it total econom activ to what the Organ for Econom Cooper and Develop call famili benefit . That is four time the share spent in the Unit State . Govern transfer have typic reduc the child poverti rate to under 10 percent , accord to O.E.C.D . figur . In the Unit State , they shave it by onli a few percentag point .The point is , famili at the bottom end of French societi , and their children , did a better job of overcom the econom transform that shook the industri world over the last quarter-centuri becaus France welfar state did not let them fall that far .And when famili did split up , the state doubl down : 36 percent of French children live with a nonwork singl parent are poor . That sound like a lot , but in the Unit State , accord to O.E.C.D . statist , it is 92 percent .If we are make polici for the sake of the children , it not hard to figur out who made the better call .', 'WASHINGTON  The Suprem Court on Tuesday side with thousand of worker at an Iowa pork process plant who had sought to band togeth in a singl lawsuit to recov overtim pay from Tyson Food .Justic Anthoni M.

Where the employer record are inaccur or inadequ and the employe can not offer convinc substitut ,  the court said in 1946 , it is enough for worker to reli on suffici evid to show the amount and extent of that work as a matter of just and reason inference.In dissent , Justic Clarenc Thoma , join by Justic Samuel A.

And , just as 120 employe anecdot could not establish that all 1.5 million class member face discrimin , neither can the Tyson workers evid establish that all 3,344 class member spent the same amount of time don and doffing.The worker in the case , Tyson Food v. Bouaphakeo , No . 14-1146 , had won about $ 6 million .

If there is no way to ensur that the jury damag award goe onli to injur class member , that award can not stand ,  he wrote .The decis wa the second victori for plaintiff in the three class-act case the court ha heard thi term .

Yet the lowest-emiss model are among the least popular .Environment activist contend that automak do not need big sale of electr car to meet CAFE goal and can consist improv fuel economi by ad current technolog  like stop-start system , which cut engin power when a car is idl  in all of their vehicl .Auto compani are produc more truck and fewer car ,  said Daniel Becker , director of the advocaci group Safe Climat Campaign . But they are fail to use their best technolog , like turbocharg and stop-start , throughout their fleets.Instead , compani are reli on emiss credit to balanc their surg sale of lower-mileag truck and S.U.V. . These loophol are question and need to be tighten ,  he said .Most automak are in complianc with current fuel standard and have been steadili improv the mileag of most vehicl in their lineup with lighter materi , more aerodynam design and smaller engin .Yet hybrid version of midsiz sedan sell poorli compar to gasoline-pow model , and consum are more often choos larger engin option in pickup becaus of cheaper ga .Thi week , an array of new electr and hybrid vehicl will be on display at the annual New York Intern Auto Show .

She refer to the origin announc , which said that Target regularly assess issu that could affect busi , guest and employe , and given the specif questions rais by recent legisl propos , we felt it wa import to state our position.Target may be bet on a more progress shift in nation attitud on gender and sexual .

Ackman ha becom the unoffici leader of a thunder herd that ha lost billion of dollar bet on Valeant Pharmaceut over the past year .The 49-year-old founder of Persh Squar Capit Manag , the $ 12.5 billion hedg fund , found himself go to bat again for Valeant on Wednesday when he testifi befor Congress about Valeant controversi drug price polici , which have includ inflat the price of vital heart medicin right befor learn that gener equival were come to the market .Mr. Ackman firm ha lost billion of dollar on Valeant . Share of the Canadian drug maker have plummet 85 percent sinc he first pitch the compani as one of hi best invest idea at a hedg fund chariti event last year .Not coincident , big name like Paulson & Compani , Vike Global Investor and Brahman Capit have also lost billion , collect , by bet on Valeant  underscor a grow phenomenon of hedg fund groupthink . It is a reflect of big-dollar investor chase too few idea and get trip up when thing turn poorli for a compani they have set big marker on .The bottom line is , hedg fund herd is not go away anytim soon ,  said Andrew Karolyi , a professor of financ at Cornel Univers . If anyth , we are now see the earli sign that thi type of hedg fund herd is spill over into herd of larg institut investor . To the extent that that spillov grow and expand , then we will be concerned.Hedg fund pile into Valeant as the stock soar more than $ 200 a share last year , even as warn sign about the company leadership and busi practic began to appear . The stock is now trade around $ 36 a share , as Valeant prepar to instal a new chief execut and race to meet a deadlin to file a delay financi report .Big hedg fund employ team of analyst to conduct research on compani , and they also spend ten of million of dollar on outsid research . But manag are also influenc by the big bet of their counterpart : So-cal best idea get exchang at charit event and exclus industri dinner attend by trader and manag .Whi do peopl believ it ?  ask David Mari , an analyst at Well Fargo . They follow Valeant becaus they want to follow it . They want to believ they have found a new way to make money in pharmaceut without invest in new drug  it sound like a magic money box.The crowd of hedg fund into Valeant wa not an isol event .SunEdison , a renew energi compani , wa onc a hedg fund darl . Big investor includ Omega Advisor , Glenview Capit Manag and Greenlight Capit Manag . David Einhorn , the founder of Greenlight and one of the industry most close follow investor , emerg as SunEdison head cheerlead when he gave a present promot it in Octob 2014 at a Manhattan chariti event . He call hi present : Here Come the Sun- ,  play of SunEdison stock ticker name .Mr. Einhorn , 47 , whose fund at it peak own 6.8 percent of the company share , remain bullish on SunEdison prospect even as the stock , which wa trade at about $ 31 a share last summer plung dure the remaind of the year . In earli Januari , as SunEdison share were trade at $ 3 , Mr. Einhorn got a repres appoint to the company board .Then on April 21 , the compani file for bankruptci . Share now trade for around 24 cent .Calcul specif loss for a hedg fund is difficult without know the price which a firm purchas it share . But Valeant and SunEdison plung share price have caus consider carnag .It is a time of turbul for the hedg fund industri , where some of the biggest name have report double-digit loss . Last year , firm fell deepli into the red after wide swing in certain so-cal hedg fund hotel stock , lead what Daniel S. Loeb of Third Point Manag call a hedg fund kill field in a recent investor letter .The total valu of hedg fund posit in SunEdison , which onc account for 66 percent of the company share , is now worth just $ 15 million after it bankruptci file , accord to FactSet , the financi research firm . Befor hedg fund began sell their SunEdison share last year , the valu of all of those firms hold wa $ 3.5 billion .The loss are wors with Valeant . At the begin of 2015 , hedg fund own about 23 percent of the company share . Today , the market valu of the industry hold in Valeant have fallen by $ 7.3 billion even as hedg fund bought more , accord to FactSet .Firm have until mid-May to disclos whether they sold or bought share in the fourth quarter .That so mani hedg fund remain bullish on Valeant despit month of turmoil  as question were rais repeatedli about it account practic  reflect the difficulti manag sometim have with chang cours .We all get lazi and when an idea seem to be work  inertia tend to take over and you stop pay attent ,  said Jame Chano , the founder of Kyniko Associ and one of Wall Street best-known bearish investor . That on full evid with Valeant and SunEdison too ,  he ad .Mr. Chanos firm began research Valeant in late 2013 . The compani wa a classic corpor roll-up that wa grow becaus of serial acquisit , pile on the debt at the same time . Hi short thesi focus on the fact that Wall Street wa give the compani too much credit for futur growth that would continu onli as long as Valeant could keep acquir bigger compani .In Februari 2014 , Mr. Chano present Valeant as a stock to short at hi annual Bear in Hibernation retreat in Miami , which some three dozen of hi friend and like-mind bearish investor in the hedg fund industri routin attend .Mr. Ackman reach out to Mr. Chano a month later to learn about hi short bet and Mr. Chano offer to share hi research . Mr. Ackman appear not to be persuad and by Februari of the next year , he began to build what is today a 9 percent stake in Valeant .Now , as a recent appoint member of Valeant board , Mr. Ackman is not onli one of the biggest investor in the compani , but ha also posit himself as an architect of it potenti comeback as well . Hi most recent investor letter on April 26 , emphas hi role in step in to stabil the compani earlier thi year , gain two seat on the board .But much work remain . Valeant still ha a debt pile of $ 31 billion to manag . It continu to wrestl with the fallout from a now shutter mail-ord drug distribut compani , Philidor Rx Servic , which led to an intern review of it account for revenu from that channel . It may have to restat earlier earn .Mr. Ackman , in hi open statement on Wednesday to the Senat Special Committe on Age , tri to strike a conciliatori tone when it came to the uproar over Valeant histori of increas price on drug it acquir through acquisit . He said Valeant will institut a process to ensur it consid all appropri factor and patient access in particular , when set price for it drugs.Scold by one senat for not look close enough into Valeant drug price , a somewhat fluster Mr. Ackman said , I regret that we didnt do more due diligence.For Mr. Einhorn and SunEdison , the path forward is more uncertain . Normal , equiti holder get littl to noth in a bankruptci reorgan . Mr. Einhorn Greenlight firm cut it stake in the compani nearli in half a few day befor the bankruptci file , but by then , the damag wa done .Mr. Einhorn ha not said anyth sinc the bankruptci file and ha said littl to hi investor thi year about hi bet on SunEdison .But in a letter to investor in Januari , Mr. Einhorn quot David Bowi , in what now seem like a prescient statement , I dont know where Im go from here , but I promis it wont be boring.', 'DETROIT  In an unusu allianc between a tradit automak and a technolog compani , Ford Motor and Googl on Wednesday join to lead a coalit of compani that advoc feder approv of driverless car in the near futur .By team up to promot regul that favor fully-autonom vehicl , Ford and Googl may be move toward closer cooper on the actual develop of driverless model .Ford chief execut , Mark Field , ha said in recent month that hi compani is evalu potenti partnership with other firm on autonom vehicl , but ha not made ani formal move in that direct .Still , by form a public polici coalit that includ Googl , Ford is align with Silicon Valley most promin support of car that can oper without a driver .The group , which call itself the Self-Driv Coalit for Safer Street , present testimoni on Wednesday at a hear on autonom vehicl held by the Nation Highway Traffic Safeti Administr .The hear wa the second conduct by the feder agenc as it tri to develop nation guidelin for the use of autonom car on American roadway .In Januari , the Obama administr said it hope to expedit regulatori guidelin for autonom vehicl and to invest in research to help bring them to market .While Googl ha been at the forefront in test driverless model , mani mainstream automak like Ford are also acceler develop of a wide rang of autonom vehicl .At Wednesday hear at Stanford Univers in California , the nation top auto safeti regul , Mark Rosekind , said the feder govern wa hope that driverless technolog could help reduc the annual death toll from traffic accid .

The potenti deal , which still could fall apart , valu DreamWork Anim at about $ 3 billion , accord to peopl with knowledg of the talk who spoke on the condit of anonym becaus they were not author to discuss them .If complet , the deal would underscor the constant balanc act requir of Comcast . On one side is it cabl and broadband busi , which control the pipe that deliv content to people home , and which face increas regulatori scrutini . On the other is the NBCUnivers entertain busi , which span broadcast and cabl televis , film and theme park .The acquisit of DreamWork Anim would fit squar into the entertain strategi , allow Comcast to build on an alreadi success part of the compani .It ha been veri clear that they cant do mani deal within cabl , so their focu is on organ growth and oper excel ,  said Ami Yong , an analyst with the Macquari Group .She note that the compani had made a seri of deal on the entertain side , acquir a major ownership stake of the Univers Studio Japan theme park and invest in the digit outlet Vox and BuzzFe .DreamWork would be big in the context of the studio busi , Ms. Yong said .Dure a confer call Wednesday morn , Comcast execut declin to comment on the specul deal activ .

The price would be small . To put it in perspect , a deal for DreamWork Anim would be about one-fifteenth the size of Comcast fail bid for Time Warner Cabl and about a tenth the size of it $ 30 billion acquisit of the entertain group NBCUnivers , which close five year ago .Also , veri few content compani , particularli in famili entertain , are avail to purchas .DreamWork Anim would give Comcast entertain busi an immedi lift , with it establish anim studio and a grow televis busi . It also ha a grasp on the elus millenni market with it part ownership of AwesomenessTV , the produc and distributor of program aim primarili at teenag girl .At the same time , it would give Comcast a gateway to intern growth .

Comcast is also build a $ 3.3 billion theme park in Beij . Unfett access to Kung Fu Panda could assist that effort , analyst said .Dure the confer call on Wednesday , Stephen B. Burk , NBCUniversal chief execut and senior vice presid of Comcast , said that focus on build film franchis had been an explicit strategi for the compani . He note that Comcast had onli one franchis five year ago in The Fast and the Furious action film , and it now ha eight and is tri to build more . He said the compani review it five-year plan for the film group on Tuesday and spent half the time talk about how to take care of franchises.A Comcast takeov of DreamWork Anim is not without challeng . A deal would put Comcast in busi with some of it fiercest rival : DreamWork Anim is a big supplier of televis cartoon to Netflix , which offer a low-cost altern to pay for tradit televis and wa a vocal oppon of Comcast Time Warner Cabl deal . And AwesomenessTV is part own by Verizon , which sell compet televis and Internet servic .The deal would requir that Comcast execut return to Washington to , onc again , lobbi for approv .It probabl doesnt present as big of a regulatori issu ,  Ms. Yong said , but it could present a conflict of interest becaus of DreamWorks agreement with Netflix and the ownership of AwesomenessTV.', 'Hulu , until now primarili a rerun servic for episod of broadcast televis show , is work to creat a more robust offer that would stream entir broadcast and cabl channel to consum for a monthli fee .The still-unnam servic wa describ by three execut with direct knowledg of Hulu plan , who spoke on the condit of anonym . Mike Hopkin , the chief execut of Hulu , may discuss the concept at Hulu present for advertis on Wednesday .Hulu is plan to introduc the servic earli next year . While exact price detail are still be determin , the new servic is expect to cost about $ 40 a month .News of the servic wa report earlier by The Wall Street Journal .Hulu want to offer what is known as a skinni bundle of broadcast and cabl channel  in particular those oper by 21st Centuri Fox , the Walt Disney Compani and Comcast NBCUnivers . Those three media compani co-own Hulu .We believ the import takeaway is that thi is a way for programm to take more control of their destini in a fragment pay TV ecosystem with heighten risk of skinny bundl inclusion/exclus ,  Steven Cahal , an analyst with RBC Capit Market , said in a research note on Monday .Two execut describ the develop as part of an effort to rethink the way TV compani approach stream video to make the experi easier for viewer .The new servic would not look like a regular cabl channel , instead offer a more intuit , person experi , one person said . It also would allow for more target commerci , where advertis could select particular audienc to see their messag . An ad for cat food , for exampl , would be aim at cat owner .Offer a combin of live and record program to stream servic requir chang tradit right agreement , and the TV compani are expect to start make their program avail to other stream servic in a similar fashion , one execut said .Other such slimmed-down stream televis servic includ Sling TV , avail for about $ 20 a month , and PlayStat Vue , which start at about $ 40 a month .The servic are aim at younger consum who prefer a more tailor stream experi over a tradit cabl or satellit subscript packag and custom known as cord cutters who resist pay for bundl of hundr of cabl channel .Todd Juenger , an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein , said in a recent research note that while a new Hulu offer would allow TV compani the chanc to capit on the push toward more tailor bundl , it also would come with a number of risk .One major risk could be that tradit cabl and satellit distributor might see the new Hulu servic as a declar of war . That could put at risk the billion of dollar the TV network receiv each year from those tradit distributor .Mr. Juenger paint a pictur of futur negoti . We expect everi futur distribut negoti would start like thi : Whi should we carri your network at all ? If consum want them , they can buy them directli from you ? Thank for make our decis easi  your dropped.Anoth risk is that the network left out of the new offer might join togeth to creat their own lower-cost competitor , he said .', 'WHEN you sell a use video game consol to the retail GameStop , it goe on a long journey befor wind up in the pre-own section insid a store .The product travel to one of GameStop repair facil , like it enorm refurbish oper center in Grapevin , Tex. , where it undergo a litani of test . A use PlayStat , for exampl , would be check for everi compon , from the disc-load tray to the laser that read the game . Ani malfunct compon would be replac , and with the consol inspect , clear of person data and clean , it becom offer for sale .We have to somewhat be like a doctor and ask a lot of question ,  said Bruce Kulp , GameStop senior vice presid for suppli chain and refurbish . The worst thing in our world is to have someth go out that been pre-own and a consum ha an issu with it.GameStop refurbish of video game consol underlin how a use electron sold by a reput brand can often be as good as buy new . While a use product may lack the origin packag or there might be some scuff on it , the qualiti of mani of the devic remain high and peopl who buy the gadget do the world a favor by put more use into the energi , metal , plastic and human labor invest in creat the product , said Carol Mar , the senior research lead for the Sustain Consortium , which studi the sustain of consum good .Those who buy use gadget are also part of a trend of anti-consumer , which includ maintain electron to get more use out of them for a longer period , rather than discard and constantli upgrad to the latest product .There are no firm number indic how mani American buy use electron . About 25 percent of GameStop revenu last year consist of sale of use product , which wa flat compar with the previou year . Amazon said that more custom are shop in it use product store , though it declin to provid number . Mani organ deal with use electron sell to those that can not easili afford technolog , like public school or econom disadvantag countri .Yet use electron often face a bad rap  peopl may lack trust in a pre-own product becaus it ha been use by someon other than themselv . To see whether such stigma is warrant , I compar the pre-own product program of three retail : Amazon , GameStop and Gazel . My takeaway is that you can buy pre-own product from reput brand with as much confid as you might buy a use car from a certifi dealer .Amazon in-hous program for pre-own product is call Warehous Deal . The giant onlin retail sell use product in 25 categori , includ televis , camera , comput , kitchen gadget and cellphon . Mani of the item come from custom who open the packag or use the good and return them to Amazon .Glenn Ramsdel , director of Amazon Warehous Deal , said everi item wa check by hand for it physic and function condit . A wireless speaker , for exampl , would be test for it connect featur and check for includ accessori ; repair are made if necessari .Then the item get a grade . Like new mean it wa probabl untouch and in perfect condit ; veri good describ an item that wa well care for and lightli use ; a good item might show sign of wear and tear but work perfectli ; and acceptable would be someth that ha cosmet issu like scratch and dent but otherwis work .The discount vari in Warehous Deal , but with a bit of time , peopl can scout out some good deal . An Amazon 6-inch Kindl sell for $ 60 brand new , but in good condit it sell for about $ 43.50 , a discount of almost 28 percent .Gazel offer cash for consumers pre-own smartphon , Appl laptop and iPad . Befor the product are list for sale , they go through a rigor test program similar to GameStop . The item are ship to a process center in Louisvil , Ky. , and undergo what Gazel call a 30-point inspect , test everyth from a phone camera len to it wireless connect . Smartphon batteri need to have at least 80 percent of their capac remain , otherwis they are replac with new one , the compani said .Dave Maquera , the presid of Gazel , said that similar to the inspect program use by certifi pre-own car dealer , Gazelle process creat a new level of confid in buy use phone and comput . Though he declin to provid specif number , he note that sale of use devic to consum had jump a double-digit percentag compar to last year .At GameStop , the product test get intens . Mr. Kulp , the suppli chain execut , said the compani take up to 100 game consol a month , refurbish them and put them through stress test , run them for thousand of hour to see if it repair are long-last . These test unit are never sold to consum .It just like the way a car compani would do a crash test ,  he said .As for use video game , the compani buff out ani light scratch from the disc , but if the game is so deepli scratch that it becom unplay , it head to the shredder .The trade-off for buy use game at GameStop are fairli obviou . For one , after a new game releas , you will have to wait awhil to buy it use : In other word , you will be a late adopt . For anoth , the product will probabl lack it origin packag and there might be light cosmet wear . But for the averag consum , all that matter is that your game experi will be exactli the same as if you had bought the product new .What if someth goe wrong ? Amazon and GameStop give custom 30 day to return use product , the same amount of time they allow for return of new product . Gazel offer a free 30-day warranti for each devic and the option to buy an extend warranti .Consum should alway consid check out the use section of retail for most electron , includ smartphon , laptop and desktop comput , said Dr. Mar of the Sustain Consortium . In my person experi buy use video game , comput and even home gadget like vacuum cleaner from GameStop , Gazel and Amazon , I have never regret buy use item .But Dr. Mar said to bewar of buy use televis and comput monitor , sinc a lot more can go wrong with larger screen than with comput equip . The juri is also still out on buy use wearabl devic like Fitbit tracker becaus they make up a fairli new categori , she ad .Even if you choos not to buy use , the best thing you can do is sell your gadget as soon as you stop use it so that someon els can give it some love . ( I test sever trade-in and recycl servic last year , and found all of them to be headache-fre . ) If you procrastin , the product can get too old , mean the retail wont be abl to resel it , so it may end up in a shredder , Dr. Mar said .Turn over that old devic so that somebodi can get a second life out of it ,  she said . There no reason for it to go into a drawer.', 'Peopl who miss the incom tax file deadlin last week might not be contact by the Intern Revenu Servic immedi . But make no mistak : Those who are suppos to file will hear someth eventu .Theyr not go to hear from the I.R. . right away ,  said Cari Weston , director of taxat at the American Institut of Certifi Public Account . It take time , she said , for the agenc to receiv all the form necessari to reconcil return , so nonfil may not hear until fall at the earliest , and often much later .But if you didnt file , and you owe the feder govern money , penalti and interest are alreadi accru . So it best , said Cindi Hockenberri , director of educ and research servic with the Nation Associ of Tax Profession , to take step to head thing off as quickli as possibl .Ms. Hockenberri said the best thing that those who miss the deadlin can do i get their return file , prior to hear from the I.R.S.The longer you wait , the more penalti and interest pile up . Even if you cant pay what you owe , you should still file as soon as possibl becaus there a failur to file penalti of 5 percent a month of the amount owe , up to 25 percent , she said . In contrast , the failur to pay penalti is just one-half of 1 percent . It rack up realli fast ,  she said , so you dont want to put it off.The I.R. . did not have the number of late-fil return for thi year immedi avail , but the agenc said the vast major of peopl file and pay their tax on time . In 2015 , the I.R. . receiv about 150 million individu tax return , while about 1.1 million peopl did not respond after the agenc notifi them that it had not receiv a return .Those who dont owe tax dont have to worri  there no penalti due . But if you are owe a refund , you cant claim it until you file your return . You have three year from the origin due date to file and claim your refund , Ms. Hockenberri said . After that , you will forfeit the money . Wait to file if you are owe a refund make littl sens becaus the I.R. . wont pay interest on your money . File ,  she said , and get that money back.Anoth reason to file the return is that while you may not think you owe tax , the I.R. . may reach a differ conclus , Ms. Weston said . Then you will owe both the tax and the accompani penalti .It also possibl that if you dont file , the I.R. . may file a substitute return , prepar use document that it receiv from employ and other sourc . The agenc will then assess tax base on your incom , but without item deduct .If you cant afford to pay tax you owe right away , you should file and pay what you can , said Vladislav Lapochkin , an enrol agent , or feder author tax prepar , in La Vega . Then , contact the I.R. . about pay in monthli instal . If you owe less than $ 50,000 , you can appli onlin . The plan can extend for as long as 60 month .Even if you owe more than $ 50,000 , the agenc will probabl be agreeabl to a payment plan . The I.R. . just want to collect the tax ,  Ms. Weston said .Here are some question and answer about file after the tax deadlin : Can I still request an extens to file my tax return ?No . You cant file for an extens after the offici tax file deadlin . One except , accord to the I.R.S. , is if you were live outsid the Unit State or were on militari duti outsid the countri on the file deadlin . In that case , you get an extra two month  until June 15  to file your tax or to file an extens . What if I live in a declar disast area ?The I.R. . said thi week that it would extend the tax file and payment deadlin to Sept. 1 for sever counti in Texa affect by the recent flood . When Im final done file , how long should I save my tax record ?At least three year , and prefer six , Ms. Hockenberri said . When file your record , she said , it help to note ani hurdl or problem you encount , so you can be better prepar to file on time next year . Ms. Weston advis that do a bit of organ now can make thing go more smoothli next tax season . Use tax or financi softwar can help , but even design a tax return drawer in your home for store document and form is better than noth . At least ,  she said , it a central location.', 'SAN FRANCISCO  Mark Zuckerberg nurtur Facebook from a dorm room idea into the world biggest social network . Now the compani is take step to ensur it founder remain in charg .Facebook on Wednesday propos a new class of stock , known as C share , in a move meant to allow Mr. Zuckerberg to maintain control of the Silicon Valley compani . The creation of the new class of share allow the chief execut to preserv hi vote power at Facebook , even as he begin an effort to give away the major of hi stock for charit purpos .Facebook said the move wa not a tradit govern model ,  but it ad that Facebook wa not built to be a tradit company.The propos speak to a veri Silicon Valley etho where compani founder often reign suprem  and where corpor structur have shift to accommod that philosophi . Over the past decad , more tech compani have adopt two class of stock so that their founder can cement their vote power at the firm . In 2012 , Googl announc that it wa creat a third class of share to prevent it founders vote power from diminish .Mr. Zuckerberg on Wednesday cite the Silicon Valley mantra of founder in explain the new class of stock , call Facebook a founder-l company. In a confer call , he ad , Facebook ha been built on a seri of bold move . When I look out on the futur , I see more bold move ahead of us , not behind us.The social network on Wednesday also report robust first-quart earn that show the result of Mr. Zuckerberg leadership . Facebook said sale rose 52 percent to $ 5.3 billion from a year ago , while profit increas to $ 1.5 billion , tripl from $ 512 million a year earlier . Exclud certain item , profit wa 77 cent a share , far surpass Wall Street expect of 62 cent a share .Facebook share , which are up more than 33 percent over the past year , soar 9 percent in after-hour trade .Facebook said it began consid a third class of stock last August when a committe of three director  Erskin Bowl , Susan Desmond-Hellmann and Marc Andreessen  start evalu the company capit structur . In Decemb , Mr. Zuckerberg and hi wife , Dr. Priscilla Chan , announc the creation of a limit liabil compani to which they would give 99 percent of their Facebook share dure their lifetim for charit purpos .Mr. Zuckerberg philanthrop plan pose an issu for hi long-term control of Facebook . Mr. Zuckerberg , who is chief execut , own almost 4 million Facebook class A share and 468 million , or 85 percent , of it class B share , give him overal vote power of 60 percent . But if he were to give away 99 percent of hi Facebook stock over time , hi vote power at the compani would declin to less than 50 percent .The new C share effect allow Mr. Zuckerberg to maintain 60 percent of vote power while still give away larg amount of stock . Under the propos , all holder of Facebook stock will get two C share for each A or B share that they own . Importantli , the C share come with no vote power . Holder of A share are entitl to one vote per share , while holder of B share have 10 vote a share .That mean Mr. Zuckerberg , as the major owner of Facebook share , will obtain a larg amount C share that he can then donat without dilut hi vote power in the compani .It is a ration , if somewhat eyebrow-rais way , for founder to distribut wealth without give up oper control of the compani ,  said Lise Buyer , founder of the Class V Group , which advis start-up on initi public offer . Thi structur will continu to allow Facebook to make decis that may not alway look great in the short term , but may pay off for investor over time.Facebook C share may trade at a slight discount to A share , which would still have one vote . Most investor current hold A share , which onli have about a quarter of the overal shareholders vote power , so they may not be forgo much if they choos to sell their A share versu their C share .It almost like vote Republican in Massachusett  you can do it , but it wont affect the outcom ,  said Rick Kline , a partner in the technolog and capit market practic of law firm Goodwin Procter .Investor get new C share will not gain econom becaus the same proport of new stock will be given to all holder .Mr. Zuckerberg might have a more difficult time convinc sharehold to accept the new class of share were hi compani not do so well . Facebook financi result on Wednesday were a far cri from the disappoint number post in the past 10 day by peer like Twitter , whose advertis busi show sign of stumbl on Tuesday , or Alphabet , the parent compani of Googl , which miss analysts estim for revenu last week .Facebook , in contrast , ha figur out how to wring billion of dollar from it member on mobil devic and other platform , make the company revenue-gener machin unstopp .The compani said 82 percent of it advertis revenu came from mobil devic in the first quarter . In addit , Facebook is start to spin up revenu in Instagram , the photo-shar applic , and is test advertis on Facebook Messeng , the messag servic for which the compani recent introduc autom custom servic bots.And while growth in new user on Facebook ha slow in recent year , the total is still get larger . Facebook said 1.65 billion peopl visit the site on a monthli basi in the first quarter , up from 1.44 billion a year earlier . More than 1.5 billion peopl are monthli mobile-onli user , up from 1.25 billion a year ago .Facebook other big bet like WhatsApp , the messag servic , and Oculu , it virtual realiti play , have yet to pay off with immens new revenu stream . But Facebook is comfort gather a critic mass of user  nearli a billion in WhatsApp case  and then introduc advertis later on when it make more sens .To me , thi is like Googl 10 year ago ,  said Mark Mahaney , an Internet analyst at RBC Capit . They realli had such momentum , and theyr prove how valuabl they are to both advertis and consumers.', 'WASHINGTON  The Feder Reserv , determin to move cautious , said on Wednesday that the American economi still wa not readi for higher interest rate .The Fed said that the labor market continu to get stronger , yet it made the wide expect decis not to rais it benchmark interest rate , which remain close to zero , and it offer no suggest that a rate increas wa immin .In a statement after a two-day meet of it policy-mak committe , the Fed paint a mix pictur of the American economi . Labor market condit have improv further even as growth in econom activ appear to have slow ,  the Feder Open Market Committe said . It note similarli that incom had climb while household spend had slow .The case against higher rate is basic that it make sens to err on the side of stimulu . By hold borrow cost at low level , Fed offici say , it will be rel easi to respond to stronger inflat by do less to encourag spend and borrow . If the Fed rais rate prematur , howev , it will have littl room to correct the error by do more .The central bank left itself room to maneuv , though , and the Fed two-hand assess of econom condit appear to confus financi market .Investor initi bid up yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasuri , suggest they expect interest rate to rise more quickli than anticip befor the meet . But then they revers cours and drove yield sharpli lower . The 10-year yield end the trade day down 4 percent at 1.85 percent .Some analyst still think the Fed may rais rate at it next meet , in June , particularli if other econom indic show the same strength as job growth . Other , howev , said they did not expect a rate increas until later in the year .Over all , investor are bet against June , put the chanc of an increas around 20 percent , and the Fed on Wednesday made littl effort to chang mind .There wa a distinct absenc of tee up a hike in June ,  economist at BNP Pariba wrote in an analysi . Inde , it is difficult to see how a hike could be deliv , despit reduc extern risk , until the economi take on a more posit tone.TD Secur , which had predict an increas in June , said it now expect none until Septemb .Relax and enjoy your summer !  said Craig Bishop , lead strategist for the fix incom group at RBC Wealth Manag , write off a rate increas until Novemb .The Fed alreadi had back away from it Decemb project that it would rais rate four time thi year . Offici in March predict just two rate increas . But Janet L. Yellen , the Fed chairwoman , said thi month that she did not regard the Decemb increas as a mistak , and she and other offici have continu to suggest that more move are like thi year .I said at the time and continu to feel that the economi had made veri substanti progress ,  Ms. Yellen said at an event in New York .Other offici , too , have caution against assum too much caution .I do not see that the risk are so elev , nor the outlook so pessimist , as to justifi the except shallow interest rate path current reflect in financi futur market ,  Eric S. Rosengren , presid of the Feder Reserv Bank of Boston , said in New Britain , Conn. , last week .While the Fed latest statement acknowledg the weak of some recent econom data , it also note a number of reason that growth could gain strength .Much of the weak in econom activ that manifest in recent data appear to have been downplay in the statement and is in ani case larg in the rear view as far as the committe is concern ,  said Michael Dolega , a senior economist at TD Bank .For exampl , there is a divid in the recent round of govern data between the report strength of job growth and the report weak of overal econom activ . The earli estim of job growth are histor more accur , and the Fed choic of languag suggest Fed offici think the report econom weak may be overst . The statement describ job growth as improv but said econom growth appears to have slow .The Commerc Depart is schedul to report it initi estim of first-quart growth in econom activ on Thursday ; the number is expect to be modest , perhap littl more than a 1 percent annual pace .The statement also suggest that the Fed concern about global econom weak had diminish . The Fed last statement , in March , describ global condit as a headwind for domest growth . The April statement said mere that the Fed continu to monitor global econom and financi develop .The chang may reflect better news from China , but the Fed still appear to be unusu attent to global develop . One loom risk is the British referendum in late June on continu membership in the European Union .On inflat , too , the Fed appear to be wait for expect improv .Sinc the financi crisi , the economi ha consist fallen short of the Fed annual inflat target of 2 percent . And some offici have express concern that recent declin in measur of inflat expect may reflect a loss of confid the Fed will hit the target in futur year .Some measur of expect have shown sign of rebound . One such measur compar two kind of Treasuri , one of which increas in valu to compens investor for inflat . Thi comparison show investor are demand compens for annual inflat of about 1.74 percent in five year , up from just 1.47 percent in late Februari .When govern data show faster inflat at the begin of 2016 , Fed offici rais doubt about the accuraci of the data . They said the number reflect temporari distort rather than a stronger trend . There is some evid they were right . The most recent govern data , through Februari , show weaker inflat than the previou report .Anoth batch of data , through March , is schedul for public on Friday . It is expect to show continu weak . Yet the statement on Wednesday repeat the Fed view that inflat will rebound as the effect of low oil price and a stronger dollar gradual fade .The problem face the Fed , howev , is the same one it ha been face for some time . It continu to predict better time tomorrow . And tomorrow never seem to come .', 'SAN FRANCISCO  Starboard Valu is an activist investor on a roll .Starboard , a New York hedg fund , claim two victori on Wednesday alon : settlement in it long-contenti battl with the Internet giant Yahoo and in a short-liv campaign at the chip maker Marvel Technolog .Starboard newli won board seat are the latest achiev for a hedg fund that ha becom one of the most promin practition of sharehold activ , in which investor prod compani manag to chang corpor strategi .It is a field that alreadi includ such well-known name as Carl C. Icahn , Daniel S. Loeb and William A. Ackman . But in recent year , Starboard and it chief execut , Jeffrey Smith , have risen in promin .Starboard , which wa spun off from the financi firm Ramiu five year ago , built up it success gradual . In 2011 , it sought to pressur the Internet compani AOL , demand that it shut down it Patch local news arm and sell off it trove of patent .While Starboard did not gain board seat in that campaign , AOL eventu sold off Patch and sold it patent to Microsoft for more than $ 1 billion .In 2014 , Starboard succeed in oust the entir board of Darden Restaur , the owner of the Oliv Garden chain  a rare achiev by ani activist . That came after a campaign mark memor by a nearli 300-page present that castig the compani for a host of sin , includ not salt the water in which it cook pasta and proflig breadstick distribut .Mr. Smith of Starboard step down as chairman of Darden thi month , have presid over a nearli 60 percent rise in the company share price . ( The restaur oper , howev , still doe not salt it pasta water . )The hedg fund also press Stapl and Offic Depot , the two offic suppli giant , to merg . The compani agre to the move last year , though they contend that such a deal wa in the work befor Starboard rais the issu . The deal is in limbo after the Feder Trade Commiss su in Decemb to block it on anti-competit ground .Earli thi year , Starboard publicli urg the depart store chain Macy to pursu deal for it real estat , bring in partner to gener cash from it valuabl hold , such as the flagship Herald Squar locat in Manhattan .And three week ago , the hedg fund began a fight at DepoM , a specialti pharmaceut concern , call the compani unfriendli to sharehold . Mr. Smith cite DepoMed effort to fend off an unwant takeov bid with a so-cal poison pill strategi and a plan to reloc it incorpor to Delawar from California to limit the abil of investor to call special meet .DepoM later drop the Delawar move , though Starboard said it wasnt satisfi .Wednesday achiev are notabl in their own way . Combin with the two director Yahoo ad earlier thi year , the four new director gain by Starboard mean that more than half of the technolog company board seat have chang over in 2016 . Moreov , Mr. Smith will gain a valuabl seat on the special board committe that is review Yahoo effort to sell itself .In addit , Starboard ha gain four seat on the board of Marvel , a chip maker that ha been besieg with problem , includ an intern inquiri into the company account . Thi month , the compani oust it founder as chief execut and presid .Starboard ha not alway been success . The hedg fund sought to block the $ 4.7 billion sale of Smithfield Food to a Chines meat processor in 2013 , but it fail to put togeth a rival offer .A repres for Starboard declin to comment .', 'Entrepreneur face mani obstacl in start a new busi , but the founder of Slyde Handboard face a particularli daunt one : how to creat a market for a product most peopl have never heard of , and for a sport they know noth about .Yet over the cours of five year , Slyde Handboard ha grown into a robust compani through the use of creativ market tactic that tap into a world where GoPro video celebr unusu sport and start-up can har social media  and their fan  to spread the word .The idea for Slyde wa born on a beach in Durban , South Africa , where Steve Watt spent hi childhood surf and swim . He and hi friend especi like to bodysurf the coastlin known for it challeng surf , with the help of flat , wave-rid object like flip-flop , Frisbe and even fast-food tray .When their surfboard becam too worn and waterlog to use , they broke them apart , took off the fiberglass , and shape the foam insid into five or six differ hand-held board . These handboard allow user to move faster and have more control in the water .By the time he wa 16 , Mr. Watt want to creat hi own line of bodysurf handboard .There wa no brand associ with them back then ,  he said . You had to make your own if you want one.After studi product design in London and San Francisco , Mr. Watt eventu made hi way to Lo Angel . In 2010 , he won the green card lotteri .The same week he sign the paperwork for Unit State resid , he also introduc Slyde , and wa soon help by a surf student of hi , Russel Eller . Mr. Eller had becom a close friend and lent Mr. Watt both $ 130,000 and hi Venic Beach garag to start the compani . That invest convert to equiti and Mr. Eller is now a co-found and 30 percent owner .Slyde releas it first handboard , the Wedg , in 2011 , a far more sophist version of the board Mr. Watt , now 39 , made as a teenag from the foam insid old surfboard .The company third co-found , Angela Ferendo , who is now Mr. Watts wife , join the compani in 2013 . Ms. Watt had work for two other start-up , one a food deliveri servic and the other a tech compani , and understand the inher challeng in introduc a new product to a market .But at Slyde , there wa the ad burden of invent a market for a product and popular a sport .Few peopl know about handboard becaus it ha been a nich within surf sinc the earli 1990 , said Sean Smith , execut director of the Surf Industri Manufactur Associ , a nonprofit trade associ . And bodysurf as a sport tend to be veri cliquish and hard-cor ,  Mr. Smith said . It consid one of the purest form of surfing.New product in the surf market gener must be perceiv as cool to succeed . Although they are still a veri small part of that market , in the last two year Mr. Smith ha notic increas interest in bodysurf handboard . Wer see them sold in mainstream surf shop now ,  he said .The Watts also want to distanc Slyde product from the aura of exclus that often surround surf in order to draw in particip of vari age and experi level .They did not set out to appeal to just the die-hard surfer with the long beard and the VW bus. Ms. Watt said Slyde handboard gave custom a surf experi no matter what skill level or age and the brand behind it make you feel cool.Like other start-up founder , the Watts had veri littl money for market , so have turn to low-cost way of market their product and build brand loyalti . They reli heavili on Googl AdWord , as well as Facebook and Instagram and person answer everi email and phone call . In addit , each order includ a handwritten thank-you note .Slyde websit featur verifi review from custom and Mr. Watt doe off-the-cuff guerilla-styl market ,  he said . Among those includ post a photo of a one-of-a-kind handboard on Instagram with the note : If you want thi email us and the first person get it.Those board sell within 10 minut , he said . But it the company ambassador program that ha been it most effect strategi , Ms. Watt said . Thi special categori of custom combin the idea of a brand ambassador with a loyalti reward program . Ambassador are custom so passion about the company handboard  and so activ on social media  that they gain access to a special Facebook group and a 30 percent discount on board , which rang in price from $ 119 to $ 199 .The ambassador , of which there are now about 50 , are consid part of the Slyde team , Ms. Watt said . We invit them around for brainstorm session and they are our first focu group . They post their video and photo on social media and send them to us too.

But the declin announc on Tuesday is a setback for one of the most belov brand in China .China young , middle-class consum are increasingli will , analyst say , to tri phone from the mani competitor  includ Huawei , Meizu and Xiaomi  that seek to compet with Appl on technic specif and aesthet but that offer their model at a few hundr dollar cheaper .Mani custom like Mr. Yu , who is 29 and self-employ , consid the phone they use part of their person ident , lead them to look at a broad rang of avail model . That be the case , Appl will have to fight to maintain it domin of the high end of the market .Appl also face other obstacl in China . Last week , the company iBook Store and iTun Movi servic were shut down by a Chines regul , just six month after they start oper . The rare about-fac by China suggest that Appl could face further pressur as the Chines govern increas it scrutini of American companies oper within it border .In the past four year , with strong demand in China for it product , Appl increas the number of retail store in the countri to 35 from just a hand , and Mr. Cook said on Tuesday that there would be 40 by the end of June .

On Wednesday afternoon , the mall where he work wa larg empti .None of the brand do realli great ,  he said . But while I might sell one or two Huawei phone in 10 day , I may not even sell one iPhon 6s.For year , smuggler have done a brisk busi take iPhon to mainland China from Hong Kong , where they cost less . But even the illeg seller are feel the pressur . In interview , four smuggler who did well a year ago said they had now quit the trade .The iPhone weaker sale also reflect the broader slowdown in growth in China enorm smartphon market . Jason Low , an analyst in Shanghai with the research group Canali , said he expect the Chines smartphon market to grow onli 4.7 percent in 2016 . As recent as 2013 , it wa grow 50 percent annual .If you look at the entir market , Appl can not fight off so mani competitor , like Samsung and local brand like Huawei and Oppo ,  he said . Theyr all tri to rais the averag sell price , and that will bleed into Apple sale flow.Despit the pressur , Mr. Cook said in the earn call on Tuesday that Appl wa optimistic about China , even if it wa lose ground . There is even a preced for an Appl recoveri : In 2012 and 2013 , the company sale growth in China slow as competitor like Samsung offer phone with larger screen , which are veri popular in China . When Appl final releas a phone with a similar screen size in 2014 , it market share roar back .In mani way , the compani is in a similar posit today . Samsung Edg phone stand out with screen that have round edg on one side , and mani in China say the camera on Huawei flagship model is better than Apple camera . That put more pressur on Appl to pack new featur into the next iPhon , which is expect to come out thi autumn .For Mo Chen , a 26-year-old public relat profession who own an iPhon 5 , the next Appl smartphon will have to do much more than her current model for her to be tempt .She wa blunt in her critic : The iPhon 6 and 6s are realli ugly.Mani of Ms. Mo co-work and former classmat use Android phone , she said , and she is consid switch to a devic by the South Korean compani or to a Chines phone made by ZTE or One Plu .I like Appl a lot ,  she said .

But almost nobodi buy Google ideal version of Android ; instead , most peopl buy a version that ha been chew up and predigest through the phone-maker-carri suppli chain , an intestin pathway that never fail to transform good softwar into heap of steam code . For Android phone , thi usual mean load of terribl , unnecessari app instal by carrier and by the phone manufactur itself .That whi I wa puzzl last week when the European Union open a strang new front in it antitrust inquiri against Googl . Contrari to what you might have conclud from look at your phone , the regul argu that Android problem isnt too mani preload app  it too few , and it all Google fault .Base on our investig thu far , we believ that Google behavior deni consum a wider choic of mobil app and servic and stand in the way of innov by other player , in breach of E.U . antitrust rule ,  Margreth Vestag , the European commission for competit , said in a statement .The charg make sens in the abstract . Googl make the world most popular mobil oper system , and some of it licens do compel phone maker to includ sever Googl app , even if they just want to includ the Googl Play app store . On paper , that may constitut unfair bundl ,  one of the sin that did in Microsoft at it apex in the late 1990 .Yet the European charg miss the messi realiti of life on Android , which is clear to anyon who studi the mobil softwar busi : Android phone come teem with non-Googl app , often to the point of frustrat for user . The search compani appear powerless to keep mani of them off people devic , even when do so might help it busi .There no better evid for thi than the meteor rise of Facebook , Google archriv , which announc anoth blowout earn report on Wednesday  with much of it revenu come from ad on Android phone . Facebook number show the primari weak in the European Union case : If Google grand plan realli is to keep rival off Android phone , it sure is do a poor job of it .Repres for the European Commiss and for Googl declin to comment for thi column , cite the current regulatori process . In a statement last week respond to the E.U. statement of object , Kent Walker , Google gener counsel , said the compani would aim to show regul that Android ha been good for competit and for consumers. The Feder Trade Commiss is also look into Android .Harri First , a law professor at New York Univers who studi antitrust issu , say the key difficulti for regul in thi case is that the tech world ha chang radic sinc the Microsoft antitrust case . Back then , Microsoft manag to outflank rival like Netscap by bundl it Internet Explor browser with it Window oper system , and by use licens and payment to prevent comput maker from instal compet browser .In the Microsoft era peopl were unfamiliar with download , and noth wa as effect as get the browser instal by the O.E.M. ,  he said , use the abbrevi for origin equip maker , or comput manufactur .But now , Id be surpris if peopl arent fulli at eas with download thing from app store , and peopl are familiar with have more than one app on their phone that doe the same thing ,  he said . The E.U . ha to tell an exclus stori , but it hard for me to see the exclus stori here.Consid , for instanc , the market for messag app . Googl run a messag servic call Hangout that come bundl with mani Android phone . If you scour the globe Im sure youd find peopl who regularli use and love Hangout , just like you could find peopl who regularli listen to Nickelback .But Hangout is clearli no messag juggernaut . In much of the world , that titl belong to two app own by Facebook  Messeng , which ha 800 million activ user a month , and WhatsApp , which ha more than a billion . ( Googl ha never disclos the Hangout user base ; analyst I spoke to estim that it share of the messag market wa in the singl digit . )Then there the popular of the main Facebook app . As it chief execut , Mark Zuckerberg , ha acknowledg , the compani wa late to realiz the import of mobil phone ; for year , it smartphon app wa a slow , kludgi mess , and until just a few year ago it had no mobil revenu to speak of . Googl , meanwhil , bundl it own social network , Googl Plu , with Android phone .So if you were look at the market a few year ago through the eye of an E.U . antitrust regul , you might have anticip some troubl for Facebook on Android phone , and you might even have ventur that Googl Plu would becom a hit . After all , here wa a small , late-mov upstart pit against a bundle-friendli giant that own the oper system .Of cours , that not how thing turn out . Googl Plu is now all but dead . And Facebook did not just surviv the shift to mobil phone , it becam the unstopp forc in the industri .Facebook now deriv the vast major of it revenu from mobil ad . It sale are grow at a breathtak clip . Peopl now spend more time on the Facebook app than do anyth els on their phone . Facebook embed web browser  which open if you click a web link from within the Facebook app  is now use to access nearli as mani web page as the includ web browser on Android and iO , accord to a report by the research firm ScientiaMobil .How did Facebook get so popular on phone ? On the whole , it happen the old-fashion way : Peopl love Facebook , they had no troubl find it in mobil app store , and they began to download and use it . In other word , unlik in the desktop era rule by Microsoft , Google platform domin on mobil phone doe not appear to have pose ani hindranc to a competitor rise .The same appear to be happen with other Googl rival . Googl bundl it cloud storag system , Drive , with Android , but that hasnt stop Dropbox from gain 500 million download on Android phone . Googl bundl it music servic with Android , but with 30 million pay subscrib , it is Spotifi , not Googl , that is the domin forc in stream music . ( Googl ha not disclos it subscrib number . )The E.U. object go beyond the suppos restrict that Googl place on Android app ecosystem . Anoth key charg involv Google domin in web search . Regul say Googl ensur that it remain Android domin search engin both by requir phone maker to instal the Chrome browser on their phone and , in some instanc , by pay manufactur to posit the Googl Search app on the phone home screen .Mr. First , the law professor , said the search issu isnt as clear-cut as the question of whether Googl ha restrict rival app . But he note that the gener flexibl of Android  the fact that , in gener , Googl make it pretti easi for devic maker and user to tinker with the softwar  cut in Google favor .I have thi new Samsung Galaxi S5 that I havent use befor , so I thought let see what happen if I tri to instal DuckDuckGo ,  he said , refer to the privacy-focus search engin . So I download it , that wa easi to do . And the first time that I search for someth I got a prompt that said , Which one do you want to use  and do you want to use it just onc or alway ? Mr. First said the interact wa noteworthi : Android easili let him download a rival to Google offer , and it even ask him if he want to set the rival as a default .It hard to see how the commiss could do better than that ,  he said .', 'It up to Facebook to bring some light to what ha been a dark and stormi tech earn season .The world biggest social network is schedul to report quarterli result on Wednesday , and it is project to post strong revenu growth and continu addit to it user base .

One of those seat will go to Starboard chief execut , Jeffrey C. Smith , who will also join a special board committe overse the company sale process .We look forward to get start right away and work close with manag and our fellow board member with the common goal of maxim valu for all sharehold ,  Mr. Smith said in a statement .The move may let Yahoo focu more on it sale effort while also quiet one of the company biggest and most persist gadfli , sinc Starboard must now refrain from public critic . The compani had engag two set of banker over the last sever month : some to run defens against Starboard , other to supervis the auction .Give those seat to Starboard may also remov some addit doubt about the serious of Yahoo intent in explor a sale , a process that sever peopl involv have describ as messi and confus . The hedg fund had latch on to those concern as part of it activ campaign .As part of the settlement , two exist director will step down , leav the board at 11 member . Coupl with the two new director appoint by Yahoo last month , more than half of the company board will be new thi year .The other new addit to the board are Tor R. Braham , a former technolog invest banker at Deutsch Bank ; Eddi W. Hartenstein , a director of Tribun Publish and former chief execut of The Lo Angel Time ; and Richard S.

Among them were propos from Verizon Commun , seen as the earli leader in the sale process , and from invest firm like TPG Capit , Silver Lake and a consortium led by Bain Capit and Vista Equiti Partner .Remov Starboard threat of a board fight might mean that Yahoo no longer feel compel to complet it sale process befor it next annual sharehold meet . The agreement with Starboard say Yahoo must hold it meet by June 30 . Still , compani execut have express confid in the speed of the process , and Mr. Smith is like to keep press for a time conclus .Hope for a deal have help lift Yahoo stock price more than 11 percent so far thi year .

The relationship took a further hit last month when Yahoo fill two board seat hour befor the compani wa set to sit down with Starboard .But both side continu to work on reach a settlement , which ha becom more and more common in corpor America as compani and activist alik seek to avoid the expens and uncertainti of run a full-blown proxi fight .While corpor board initi view such rabble-rous as threat to be fought , they have increasingli open up and offer director seat to end hostil .Starboard won seat on Wednesday not onli at Yahoo but also at Marvel Technolog , a chip maker that the hedg fund had fought against for onli a few month . At Marvel , the activist investor won four board seat and will have a say in the select of the company next chief execut .Some on the receiv end of Starboard campaign have eventu form cordial relationship with the hedg fund .

Mr. Trump may not ultim win all of these deleg  theyr not bound to their statement  but they could provid him with a crucial cushion if he fall a bit short in the pledg deleg count .If you includ Mr. Trump prefer deleg from the unpledg deleg slate in Pennsylvania , he is around 250 deleg short of the 1,237 necessari to win the nomin . He can cover about half of that amount with expect win in West Virginia and New Jersey and with deleg from proport state .That leav two key state : Indiana and California .Mr. Trump would easili win if he carri both state .

Some cancer drug carri price tag of more than $ 100,000 a year , and health plan are increasingli ask peopl to shoulder a greater share of the cost .In survey , American regularli cite drug price as a top health care concern , which may be whi presidenti candid keep bring them up . Congress ha jump into the debat , hold a seri of hear on the issu .But there are no simpl answer .Much of the attent ha focus on a hand of pharmaceut compani that have snap up old drug and then aggress rais price , sometim by more than 1,000 percent . Last fall , Martin Shkreli , the founder and former chief execut of Ture Pharmaceut , ignit a fierc respons on social media after it wa report that hi compani had rais the price of a little-known drug to treat toxoplasmosi to $ 750 a tablet from $ 13.50 . And Valeant Pharmaceut Intern ha receiv similar attent for rais the price of mani of it drug , includ two heart medic , Nitropress and Isuprel .Critic say these compani and other like them have unfairli favor profit over patients need . Congress ha held sever hear on these tactic , and Valeant and Ture are under investig by feder author . Presidenti candid have singl out these compani on the campaign trail .But even as the drug industri ha sought to distanc itself from compani it describ as bad actor , insur , hospit and other major health care player have rais alarm about the rise cost of new drug , includ those that treat cancer , hepat C and rare diseas . Some of those drug can cost $ 300,000 a year .Higher drug price threaten to rais insur premium and patients out-of-pocket expens and can cost taxpay more becaus of Medicaid and other govern program . But drug compani say the price reflect the enorm invest of time and resourc that go into bring a drug to market and argu that mani time , their drug can prevent more expens medic intervent like surgeri and hospit .The answer to thi is more complic than one might expect .Manufactur set list price for their brand-nam drug ; those are the eye-pop figur that have sent Congress and presidenti candid into fit of outrag .But almost no one actual pay those price . Insur and pharmacy-benefit manag , who manag drug plan for insur , negoti discount and rebat , which lower the effect cost of a drug . And they have been get better at do thi .That is whi , although list price for drug rose about 12 percent in 2015 , net price  what insur and employ actual paid  grew onli about 2.8 percent , the lowest rate in year , accord to IM Health , a research firm .Insur and other say that lower figur obscur the larger price increas in specif area like cancer treatment , where less competit exist and it is more difficult to pit manufactur against one anoth . And drug maker do profit from rais their list price becaus rebat and discount are often base on a percentag of those price .That where the real angst in the marketplac is ,  said Steve Miller , chief medic offic of Express Script .A drug path from the manufactur to the patient is circuit , and mani middlemen are paid along the way .The pharmaceut compani send the drug to a distributor , which take a fee and then sell the drug to a pharmaci , which pocket it own fee befor dispens the medic to a patient . If a patient is insur , a pharmacy-benefit manag is paid for process the transact between the pharmaci and the insur or employ . The pharmacy-benefit manag also handl the rebat that flow from the drug maker to the insur or the employ .Part of what make the issu so frustrat is that visit a pharmaci to pick up a prescript seem simpl . If you go into a retail pharmaci , it look like a retail transact ,  said Adam J. Fein , presid of Pembrok Consult , a manag advisori and busi research compani . But it is not like buy a bottl of orang juic ; most patient do not choos which drug they are pick up , nor are they pay for most of it , he said . It part of thi crazi system.The good news first : The vast major of drug dispens in the Unit State  more than 80 percent  are gener , which are low-cost altern to brand-nam drug . If your doctor write you a prescript , there is a veri good chanc it will cost you $ 10 or less .But if you have a more seriou ill or requir a newer , brand-nam drug , insur have been requir that you pay an increasingli larg share of the drug cost .Mani peopl are cover by health plan with larg deduct that requir them to pay the full price of their drug until they hit their limit , which can be thousand of dollar a year . And more plan are requir patient that need expens specialti drug to contribut a percentag of the list price . Drug compani often help cover patients out-of-pocket cost through assist program , but not alway .So patient who are the sickest and requir the most expens drug are the most vulner to soar drug price .It sort of embed in the health care system that the price is never the price , unless your a cash-pay custom ,  Mr. Fein said . And in that case , we soak the poor.', 'It ha becom an articl of faith among mani women I know to elimin some food dure pregnanc , out of concern that their children could becom allerg to them : shellfish , dairi and , most of all , peanut .After their babi arriv , they continu to abstain from certain food while breast-feed , and they certainli keep their children from eat them .But research in the last few year ha consist shown that all thi avoid often doe more harm than good . In mani case , we need to be do the opposit .Mother didnt adopt thi behavior out of nowher . In 2000 , the American Academi of Pediatr releas guidelin on reduc a child risk for develop allergi . They recommend that mother elimin peanut and tree nut ( e.g. , almond , walnut , etc . ) and consid elimin egg , cow milk , fish , and perhap other food from their diet while nursing.Further , they recommend that children at high risk for allergi be given no solid food until six month of age , no dairi product until 1 year old , no egg until age 2 , and no peanut , nut or fish until age 3 .A debat ha been rage in the health care system for decad on thi topic . I wa part of a systemat review that examin the relationship between earli solid food introduct and allerg diseas in children . We found no good evid to support the idea that be expos to solid food earlier led to persist food allergi .To it credit , the A.A.P . chang it recommend base on new research . In 2008 , updat guidelin report that matern restrict in pregnanc or breast-feed no longer seem like advic that should be wide recommend . It also acknowledg that there didnt seem much reason to delay the introduct of allergy food like peanut after six month , around the age babi move from milk or formula to a wider rang of food .Unfortun , thi did littl to chang people behavior . Mani had alreadi intern the advic . It seem logic to them that avoid food would give children less of a chanc to develop allergi . If it wa still a good idea not to expos children until they were six month old , whi not keep go ?A studi publish in The New England Journal of Medicin last year turn all of thi on it head . Research enrol 640 infant at high risk for allergi , between 4 and 11 month of age , in a trial and random them to one of two group . One of them wa to avoid peanut protein ; the other wa to eat at least six gram of peanut protein a week given in three or more meal . All particip were follow until they were 5 year old .What wa most surpris in thi work wa that 15 percent of the infant alreadi had evid of peanut sensit by allergi test . They were enrol in the trial despit thi , and half of them were given peanut extract everi week .The result were remark . At the end of the studi , about 3 percent of those expos to peanut had develop a peanut allergi , compar with more than 17 percent among those who avoid peanut .More surpris , if you look just at the children who alreadi had evid of peanut sensit when they were babi , fewer than 11 percent of those regularli expos to peanut develop an allergi . But more than 35 percent of those who avoid peanut develop an allergi .Children who had proven sensit to peanut , but consum them in their diet regularli , were less like to develop a peanut allergi than children without sensit who avoid them .Recent , follow-up result were publish . After the trial end , research ask all the particip who had been regularli consum peanut to avoid them for the next 12 month .At the end of that period , when the children were 6 , there wa no signific increas in new peanut allergi in that group . Avoid at thi point made no differ . The critic need for exposur appear to be somewher from infanc until age 5 .These result were so convinc that , onc again , expert are chang their recommend . In Septemb 2015 , the A.A.P .  along with other  argu that health care provid should recommend introduc peanut-contain product into the diet of high-risk infant earli on in life.These chang dovetail nice within what ha becom known as the hygien hypothesi , the gist of which is that as wev made our environ more and more steril , our immun system develop differ than they use to . Without exposur to outsid thing to fight , our defens turn inward and toward more benign substanc , lead to increas level of eczema , asthma and allergi .Of cours , mani peopl use to die from infect that no longer threaten us becaus of advanc , so no one should take thi as a call for live in filth . Nor should anyon take these recent find as advic to feed babi and small children peanut and other food without concern . All chang to an infant diet , especi in children with allergi , should be done in consult with a health care profession .As with mani thing in health care , howev , we went too far with our respons to peanut and other food allergi . Avoid is sometim need for those with sever reaction . When we appli those same rule to everyon els , howev , thing can backfir .', 'When Leonard Riggio bought Barn & Nobl in 1971 , it consist of a singl struggl store in Manhattan .

We felt a great deal of frustrat with the tradit co-op model becaus we had no connect with the custom or the consumer.The McCarti agre to be guinea pig of a sort , strike a deal with Dannon in 2011 that serv as a test of what the compani wa tri to do . Becaus of that deal , their dairi herd ha more than doubl to 8,500 cow spread across four farm and produc roughli 76,500 gallon of milk a day .The partnership with Dannon allow the McCarti to build a milk condens plant that reclaim 20 million gallon of water a year , which they use to water field where they grow some of the feed for their herd and for other purpos .Some of the chang Dannon wa look for werent necessarili chang for us  we alreadi had anim welfar initi go becaus cow are what pay our bill ,  Mr. McCarti said .

The two compani struggl initi , in the fall of 2014 , to find a suitabl price and breakup fee . But then , Halliburton threaten to turn over Baker Hughes board to restart discuss . The plan work , with Halliburton rais it bid and agre to a larger-than-averag fee if the deal were to fail to win regulatori approv . At the time , the fee wa a symbol commit from Halliburton to do whatev it took to make sure the deal clear the Justic Depart .As stand-alon compani , though , analyst say both Halliburton and Baker Hugh should be abl to surviv . Halliburton ha about $ 10 billion of cash on it balanc sheet that it could use toward the breakup fee or potenti other transact , accord to data by S & P ; Capit IQ .I dont see a risk of either of the compani be bankruptci risk ,  Mr. Marietta said . I think both compani are well posit to manag through the downturn.Share of both compani have surg about 20 percent each sinc the Justic Department lawsuit wa disclos on April 6 . For mani investor , the lawsuit wa a way of dissip the cloud of uncertainti that had cover the deal for 18 month .The move by the Justic Depart wa the latest tough stanc from an administr that ha been seen as take more aggress action against larg deal . The previou one wa Pfizer attempt $ 152 billion merger with Allergan , which wa termin after the Treasuri Depart came out with new tax-rel rule that elimin mani of the benefit of the deal .The European Commiss , the European Union execut bodi , also rais concern about the Halliburton-Bak Hugh deal .The transact rais competit concern on a veri larg number of market relat to oil field servic provid to oil and ga explor and product companies in Europ , Margreth Vestag , the European Union competit commission , said in a statement .She said that a number of custom contact us to rais issu with the propos transaction.The date by which Halliburton and Baker Hugh would have to decid whether to continu on their path of regulatori approv or termin their merger agreement wa extend to April 30 . As a result , Halliburton postpon it earn call to Tuesday , which mani analyst assum wa done to discuss the deal .Sinc the downturn start at the end of 2014 , Halliburton ha reduc it head count by about a third , the compani said in it April 22 earn statement .

That trend line may not revers anytim soon ; the compani , base in San Francisco , is also project sale in the second quarter that are below analyst expect .The number punctuat an earn report that show the depth of Twitter challeng . The number of peopl join the servic continu to be modest , even after a batteri of experi by the compani to lure new user . And Twitter remain unprofit , report a first-quart net loss of $ 80 million , or 12 cent a dilut share , though that wa narrow than the $ 162 million loss from a year earlier .The result add to the obstacl face Jack Dorsey , a founder of the compani who wa reappoint chief execut last year and who vow to turn it around . To do so , he restructur the board , replac longtim member with new addit . He made sweep chang in engin and product , appoint new leader as some veteran execut depart . In Octob , he cut more than 300 job , or roughli 8 percent of the work forc .Yet over the last year , Twitter stock ha plung about 65 percent . After the earn report on Tuesday , investor sent the company share down more than 12 percent in extend trade .Brand advertis have been Twitter bread and butter for year ,  said Debra Aho Williamson , an analyst for eMarket , an industri research firm .

For the last five or six year , Twitter ad busi ha been a huge driver for the compani : Growth rate regularli exceed 60 percent . For the first quarter , sale were up 36 percent from a year earlier ; they were estim to rise as littl as 17 percent in the second quarter .Adam Bain , Twitter chief oper offic , said that video advertis wa strong for the first quarter , but ad that the result were hurt becaus advertis did not spend as much on older advertis product , like promot tweet , as the compani anticip . He said that neg press report about Twitter were not have an effect on advertis .Let be perfectli clear on the reason  demand wa weaker than we thought ,  Anthoni Noto , Twitter chief financi offic , said in an interview , refer to the company revenu . He ad that the market for Twitter older advertis product wa still sizabl , though that could be threaten if the weak demand continu .Twitter face tough advertis competit from other social media compani like Facebook , which is expect to captur more than 31 percent of advertis digit spend in the Unit State thi year , accord to data from eMarket . Other compani , like Snapchat , also compet with Twitter for ad .Twitter user growth , which ha been the company prime area of concern sinc it 2013 initi public offer , improv in the first quarter  though the growth remain modest .

The compani no longer includ fast follow in it user number . A year earlier , Twitter post the total user at 302 million .The 310 million monthli visitor is more than some analyst had expect , a boost that the compani attribut to season addit and an increas in market .But those figur come with a caveat .

It provid the most direct link yet to the genesi of the decept at Volkswagen , which admit late last year that 11 million vehicl worldwid were equip with softwar to cheat on test that measur pollut in emiss .It is not known how wide the present wa distribut at Volkswagen . But it exist , and the propos it made to instal the softwar , highlight a seri of flaw decis at the embattl carmak surround the emiss problem .Those decis expos the compani to billion of dollar in fine as well as crimin investig . Last Friday , Volkswagen report a record $ 6.2 billion loss , after set asid $ 18 billion to cover the cost of fine , legal claim and recal . As a first step in a broader settlement under negoti , Volkswagen agre to fix or buy back 500,000 diesel vehicl in the Unit State , begin with model year 2009 .At variou junctur over the last decad , execut at Volkswagen ignor or underplay warn sign .As the PowerPoint underscor , peopl insid Volkswagen were awar that it diesel engin were pollut significantli more than allow . Yet compani execut repeatedli reject propos to improv the emiss equip , accord to two Volkswagen employe present at meet where the propos were discuss .Even when regul start ask question in 2014 , Volkswagen continu to instal the cheat softwar for more than a year . And the compani further compound it problem by underestim the potenti penalti and the risk to it reput , accord to court document obtain by The New York Time .Volkswagen declin to comment , cite the continu investig . The compani ha said that top manag wa not awar of the cheat softwar , known as a defeat devic . Ansgar Rempp , a partner at Jone Day , the law firm head Volkswagen intern inquiri , also declin to comment .What is now clear is that the current crisi at Volkswagen trace back to the PowerPoint present a decad ago .Volkswagen engin at the company research and develop complex in Wolfsburg realiz that the emiss equip in their newest diesel engin would wear out too quickli if it were calibr to meet American pollut standard . The emiss rule in the Unit State are more stringent than those in Europ .A technolog expert at Volkswagen offer a solut in the PowerPoint present . Just a few page long , the 2006 present includ a graph that explain the process for test the amount of pollut spew from a car . In a laboratori , regul would tri to replic a varieti of condit on the road .The pattern of those test , the present said , wa entir predict . And a piec of code embed in the softwar that control the engin could recogn that pattern , activ equip to reduc emiss just for test purpos .Element of the present were report earlier by Sddeutsch Zeitung newspap and sever German broadcast . Under German privaci law , the execut can not be name .The softwar evolv over the year . It wa later upgrad to detect other telltal sign of a regulatori test , like a steer wheel that wa not move , accord to Felix Domk , a comput expert and self-describ hacker who ha analyz the softwar .Dure regulators test , the engin softwar would turn up the pollut control . When it wa on the road , equip design to neutral harm nitrogen oxid would turn down , result in emiss that were up to 40 time the legal limit .Volkswagen had a grow awar of that emiss discrep in recent year .In a court file , the compani lawyer , as part of a defens in a sharehold lawsuit , suggest that the discrep wa common knowledg within the industri . The vehicl of all manufactur exceed variou emiss limit in normal street use ,  Volkswagen lawyer said in a court file , which wa obtain by The Time . They further argu that the differ between road emiss and lab emiss were toler by regul .The manag board led by Martin Winterkorn , the chief execut who resign in Septemb after the admiss of cheat , repeatedli rebuf lower-rank employe who submit technic propos for upgrad the emiss control , accord to the two peopl who attend meet where the propos were discuss . The manag board reject the propos becaus of cost , the peopl said .Lawyer for Mr. Winterkorn did not respond to request for comment .More effect emiss equip would have made Volkswagen vehicl hundr of dollar more expens , without provid a benefit that custom could perceiv . In the Unit State , even a modestli higher sticker price would have made it more difficult for Volkswagen to compet with rival like Toyota and Honda .But cleaner diesel would also have spare Volkswagen a scandal that ha alreadi caus sale in the Unit State to plung 13 percent from Januari through March . And repair diesel in the Unit State will cost addit hundr of million , if not billion , of dollar .Court document file in Germani by lawyer for Volkswagen show how the compani vastli underestim the potenti penalti .After American offici began ask question about Volkswagen emiss , compani execut , includ Mr. Winterkorn , thought they could deal with the problem quietli at a rel low cost , accord to the court document that were obtain by The Time .An American law firm hire by Volkswagen to examin regulatori issu , Kirkland & Elli , told the carmak in an August 2015 memo that the previou record penalti wa $ 100 million . The fine wa impos on Hyundai-Kia in 2014 for violat the limit on greenhous ga emiss involv 1.1 million vehicl , or nearli twice as mani car as in Volkswagen case .At that level , the penalti could have easili been absorb by Volkswagen , which had sale of 213 billion euro last year , or around $ 240 billion . But the potenti fine for Volkswagen is like to dwarf the previou record , base on what the compani ha alreadi set asid .Court document file by Volkswagen indic that the technician thought the chanc of be caught cheat were slim when the decept began in 2006 . While technolog to test car under road condit wa avail , it wa not wide use by regul .The seemingli small danger of discoveri may have been a factor in tempt the VW engin to make the impermiss softwar alter ,  Volkswagen lawyer said in the court document .In recent year , the chanc of discoveri increas . It becam easier to buy emiss test equip from supplier , and numer environment group or independ laboratori did so to show that mani carmak were underst diesel emiss .Sign of irregular in Volkswagen car were discov in 2014 by a nonprofit group , the Intern Council on Clean Transport , base on test perform at West Virginia Univers . Still , Volkswagen continu to instal defeat devic in it car , includ some Audi and Porsch model , until last year .Volkswagen also underplay the potenti threat of the diesel problem , as well as the wrath of American regul . Mr. Winterkorn and other top manag were use to deferenti treatment by govern offici in Germani , where it is one of the largest employ .After the American regul start look into the emiss issu in 2014 , the compani didnt give the problem much weight .Mr. Winterkorn receiv a two-pag memo in Novemb 2014 that summar the technic problem with Volkswagen vehicl in variou locat .

And in that case , we soak the poor.Some of the differ in price is the result of action taken by pharmacy-benefit manag like CV Health , which manag drug plan for insur . They have becom more sophist in recent year , lead to better discount from drug compani . They cite success like the major discount that Gilead , the maker of an expens new hepat C drug , conced after AbbVi releas a compet product . And sale of expens new cholesterol-low drug , call PCSK9 inhibitor , have been sluggish , in part becaus insur have place numer restrict on their use .I think wev up our game ,  said Dr. Troyen Brennan , chief medic offic of CV Health . It much more dynam and much more fast-pac , and I think that like us , the other P.B.M. are respond much more rapidly.So if drug makers list price arent repres of the true cost of a drug , whi risk neg public by rais them ? Mani rebat and other discount are tie to a percentag of the list price , which mean a higher list price still yield more profit . And not everi insur and pharmacy-benefit manag is as sophist as the top player , so manufactur can profit on the margin .The structur of the system is such that the onli way they can get ani increas in price is to rais the list price by a veri high percent ,  said Mr. Fein . It kind of bake into the system , and it so complic , you cant realli unwind it without blow up the entir health care system.Some of the most recent price increas may also be happen becaus drug maker are hope to profit while they can , befor congression or other action prevent them from do so , said Geoffrey Porg , the author of the Leerink analysi .When you see thi type of veri aggress price action across mani product , then you start to scratch your head and say , is thi the industri prepar for a more challeng price environ ?  he said . There just a gener fear of the unknown.Drug maker say that , despit the intens focu on their industri , drug cost account for onli around 10 percent of health care spend , an amount that ha remain rel steadi over time .Obvious there a lot of variabl that are use in determin what the appropri price are in ani product ,  said Domin Caruso , the chief financi offic of Johnson & Johnson . We price our product veri respons , and in fact the list price increas that wev taken have been consist below our competit set over the last five years.Even though insur and pharmacy-benefit manag are keep drug price in check in some area , they are lose the battl in other , especi in area like multipl sclerosi or cancer treatment , where a host of new drug have recent enter the market with littl competit .That where the real angst in the marketplac is ,  said Dr. Miller . Specialti drug , which are complex product that typic treat seriou , chronic ill , now account for 33 percent of all drug spend even though they treat about 1 to 2 percent of all patient , Dr. Miller said .Pharma is look at these lower number and say , Wer not as bad as your hear in the marketplac ,  Dr. Miller said . But he said actual drug cost were still rise . The main point is thi is still faster than your incom is grow . Your fall further and further behind , and it not sustainable.', 'WASHINGTON  Order for long-last good manufactur in the Unit State rebound far less than expect in March , accord to a report releas on Tuesday , as demand for vehicl , comput and electr good slump .

We are probabl not at the staf level we would like to be to address the volum . Thi is whi we are talk about peopl get to the airport a littl earlier than planned.To deal with the expect crowd , Mr. Rasicot said the agenc plan to assign 768 new offic to the busiest airport by June 15 . The agenc is also alloc an extra $ 26 million for overtim pay , and is look for way to move it explosive-snif dog where they will have the most effect on reduc wait time .Alreadi , passeng have report epic line .Travel have seen line stretch to the curb , snake to other termin level or even extend into differ concours .Some have manag to handl the situat with humor .Other have not been quit as forgiv .At Charlott Dougla Intern Airport in North Carolina , about 600 passeng miss their flight on March 25 becaus an inadequ number of screener led to wait exceed three hour , airport offici said . Brent D. Cagl , the airport interim director of aviat , complain to the T.S.A. , call the episod a fiasco.Thi situat could have been avoid , had the T.S.A . had the proper staf ( or overtim budget necessari ) to meet custom demand ,  Mr. Cagl wrote in a letter to the secur agenc . ( T.S.A . offici deni that the wait had ever been that long , tell local report that it had been 75 minut for a short time . )Thi wa far from an isol incid . Airport in Atlanta , Miami , New York , Seattl , Denver and Chicago , among other , have all experienc similar problem in recent month .Last month , Denver Airport advis travel to get to the airport as much as three hour befor their flight . Still , peopl wait for more than an hour and a half to clear secur .Airport worker walk up and down the line with therapi dog and hand out bottl water and candi to travel , accord to one report . The airport accus the T.S.A . of provid an inadequ number of screener on what wa an averag Saturday .T.S.A . offici say the main reason for the longer line is an increas in the number of travel thi year .Where it start is actual a volum issu ,  said Mr. Rasicot , who wa previous a senior offici with the Unit State Coast Guard , as wa the T.S.A. administr , Peter V. Neffeng . It realli a good-new stori . The economi is do well , American are travel more , and thi equat with record number at our checkpoints.At the same time , he said , the number of T.S.A . screener ha declin by about 5,800 becaus of tighter budget . The agenc current ha 42,350 agent assign for secur check .We need to stop lose peopl and we need to add more ,  he said .He said some airlin were help by assign their own employe to perform some task , like help direct passeng to the right lane or advis them on when to take off their shoe .Still , mani passeng complain that the agenc seem ill-prepar to handl the crowd .Ben Cheever , a support engin for a cybersecur firm , recent miss a flight in Seattl despit get to the airport two hour ahead of hi 6 p.m. departur to San Diego . Two line spill into the airport lobbi , he said . A third wa reserv for passeng who had sign up to a trust travel program call T.S.A . PreCheck that allow them speedier access .After 90 minut , the T.S.A . open a coupl of extra lane , but he still miss hi flight . It wa too littl , too late ,  he said . The next day , he show up three hour ahead of time . It wa the most miser busi trip Iv ever had.American Airlin said that the slower secur line had forc it to delay flight and rebook passeng who had miss connect . For instanc , in a one-week period in mid-March , the airlin said , about 6,800 of it passeng miss their flight after be stuck in T.S.A . line too long .T.S.A . line at checkpoint nationwid have becom unaccept ,  said Ross Feinstein , a spokesman for American Airlin . Line grew in Januari , Februari and March , and now in April , too . We are realli concern about what happen in the summer.Anoth factor that lengthen wait time is that passeng are carri more bag on board to avoid pay fee for check luggag .But there not much airlin can do , except warn passeng to show up three hour befor takeoff for intern flight and as much as two hour ahead of their flight for domest travel .There are other factor at play as well . Last year , the agenc vow to make chang to secur and screen procedur to address widespread safeti laps that had been uncov by the Depart of Homeland Security inspector gener .The audit found that agent had fail to spot weapon and explos in 95 percent of the undercov test . The find prompt critic by some former and current T.S.A . employe , who claim that the agenc wa keen to keep passeng move quickli through the line .In respons , the T.S.A . stop randomli process some passeng who had not enrol in a prescreen program to go through it expedit PreCheck lane .It elimin a program known as Manag Inclus II , which let offic train in behavior detect direct some passeng through the faster PreCheck lane after check them for explos use trace detect sampl .Now , T.S.A . agent send unvet passeng through the PreCheck lane onli if they have been check by explosive-snif dog while wait in line . ( That polici is call Manag Inclus I . )Meanwhil , T.S.A . agent have been find record number of gun and other weapon that passeng are bar from carri on the plane .Both the airlin and the T.S.A . said that one way to allevi the longer wait is to sign up for PreCheck , which allow elig passeng to go through the speedier lane without have to take off their shoe and belt or remov laptop and other electron devic from their bag .So far , seven million peopl have enrol in one of sever trust travel program , includ 2.5 million in the T.S.A . PreCheck program and 2.5 million in Global Entri , a program run by Custom and Border Protect .There is an $ 85 applic fee for the T.S.A . program , and a $ 100 fee for Global Entri . Both are valid for five year .The T.S.A . ha ad more PreCheck lane , but the number of peopl enrol still fall well short of the 25 million the T.S.A . would like to sign up .Even passeng with PreCheck have had close call .Ann Mari Harrison , a wine saleswoman who ha sign up for PreCheck and who fli out of Newark Liberti Intern Airport about twice a month , said she nearli miss her flight after wait more than an hour recent .That day , the secur line start downstair , in the baggag check-in area . That wa odd , she said , especi for a Sunday morn when the airport wa usual empti .Someth need to be done ,  she said . It is just crazy.Still , not everyon is complain .', 'Half a centuri ago , harvest California 2.2 million ton of tomato for ketchup requir as mani as 45,000 worker . In the 1960 , though , scientist and engin at the Univers of California , Davi , develop an oblong tomato that lent itself to be machine-pick and an effici mechan harvest to do the job in one pass through a field .The battl to save job wa on .How could a publicli fund univers invest in research that cut farmwork job onli to help large-scal grower ? That wa the question rais in a lawsuit file by a farmwork advocaci group against U.C . Davi in 1979 .Csar Chavez Unit Farm Worker union made stop mechan it No . 1 legisl prioriti . In 1980 , Presid Jimmi Carter agricultur secretari , Robert Bergland , declar that the feder govern would no longer financ research that could lead to the replac of an adequ and will work forc with machines.These day , the battl to save American job ha a differ flavor . It echo in Hillari Clinton promis to win the global competit for manufactur job and production. It live in Donald Trump call to break Nafta and impos a 45 percent tariff against Chines import , and in Berni Sanders ralli cri against trade agreement .It outcom , howev , will probabl be similar . The freez on research may have slow the mechan of California harvest , but by the year 2000 , onli 5,000 harvest worker were employ in California to pick and sort what wa by then a 12-million-ton crop of tomato .In America factori , job are inevit disappear , too . But despit the polit rhetor , the problem is not mainli global . Manufactur job are on the declin in factori around the world .The observ is uncontroversi ,  said Joseph Stiglitz , the Nobel-win economist at Columbia Univers . Global employ in manufactur is go down becaus product increas are exceed increas in demand for manufactur product by a signific amount.The consequ of thi dynam are often misunderstood , not least by politician offer slogan to fix them .No matter how high the tariff Mr. Trump want to rais to encircl the American economi , he will not be abl to produc a manufactur renaiss at home . Neither would chang tax rule to limit corpor flight from the Unit State , as Mrs. Clinton propos .The likelihood that we will get a manufactur recoveri is close to nil ,  Professor Stiglitz said . We are more like to have a smaller share of a shrink pie.Look at it thi way : Over the cours of the 20th centuri , farm employ in the Unit State drop to 2 percent of the work forc from 41 percent , even as output soar . Sinc 1950 , manufacturing share ha shrunk to 8.5 percent of nonfarm job , from 24 percent . It still ha a way to go .The shrink of manufactur employ is global . In other word , strategi to restor manufactur job in one countri will amount to destroy them in anoth , in a worldwid zero-sum game .The loss of such job ha creat plenti of problem in the Unit State . For the countless worker live in less develop reach of the world , though , it add up to a potenti disast .Japan long stagnat can be read as a consequ of a decades-long develop strategi that left the nation overli depend on manufactur . They are focus on a dead-end busi ,  said Bruce Greenwald , an expert on invest strategi at Columbia Busi School . They are not elimin hour of work in manufactur fast enough to keep pace with the reduct in work needed.The richest countri today start deindustri when they were alreadi well off and benefit from fairli skill and product work forc that could make the transit into well-paid servic job , as increasingli affluent consum devot less of their incom to physic good and more to leisur , advanc health care and other servic .Poorer countri have more limit option . If the demis of manufactur job in the Unit State forc mani worker into low-paid retail job and the like , imagin the challeng in a countri like India , where factori employ ha alreadi top out , yet incom per person is onli one twenty-fifth of what it wa in the Unit State at it peak .Develop countri are suffer prematur deindustri ,  said Dani Rodrik , a lead expert on the intern economi who teach at Harvard Kennedi School . Both employ and output deindustri is set in at much lower level of income.Thi is even happen in a manufactur behemoth like China  which appear to have max out the industri export strategi at a much lower incom level than it success Asian predecessor , like Japan and Taiwan .For poorer countri in Asia , Africa and Latin America , the declin of manufactur as a bounti sourc of job put an end to the prime path to rich that the modern world ha follow .Manufactur , Professor Rodrik point out , ha uniqu advantag . For one thing , it can quickli employ lot of unskil worker . Set up a factori to make toy put you on a product escal in a way that tradit agricultur and servic didnt do ,  he said .Moreov , product isnt constrain by a small domest market : Export of good can easili flow around the world , allow industri room to grow and give develop countri time to ride up the ladder of incom , skill and sophist .The natur resourc that domin the export of mani poor countri dont have these featur . They employ few worker and offer littl ad valu . They do not encourag acquir skill , and they expos countri to violent swing in commod price .High-end servic such as financ and program do pay well . But these arent the servic sector most poor countri build . A major of servic job in most poor countri are gener limit to housework , mom and pop retail and the like . Sinc these sector offer littl product growth and are gener isol from foreign competit , they can not pull a nation out of poverti .The first larg transit from agricultur to industri in the earli 20th centuri  well lubric by public spend on world war  liber worker from their chain far more effect than Karl Marx revolut ever did .The current transit , from manufactur to servic , is more problemat . In poor countri , Mr. Rodrik say , worker may have to pare back their aspir of develop . Who know how will polit system manag ?  he ask .In the Unit State , the polit challeng is no less daunt . Low pay marri to high profit in much of the servic economi are contribut to a widen incom chasm that is rend societi in all sort of way . Use to the prosper onc deliv by manufactur , American worker are rebel against the chang tide .Note to Mrs. Clinton , Mr. Sander and Mr. Trump : A grab at the world manufactur job is the wrong answer . Wall will damag prosper , not enhanc it . Promis to recaptur industrial-era great ring hollow .The Unit State , though , doe have option : health care , educ and clean energi , just to name a few . They present big econom and polit challeng , of cours  not least the enorm ineffici of privat American medicin and Republicans blanket opposit to more public spend .Yet just as the feder govern onc provid a critic push to move the economi from it agricultur past into it industri futur , so , too , could it help build a postindustri tomorrow .', 'Kelli Ripa return to her morn show on Tuesday and declar , with a smile , that our long nation nightmar is over.Ms. Ripa return to Live With Kelli and Michael end a weeklong saga after she wa said to have felt blindsid by ABC announc that her co-host , Michael Strahan , would leav the show for Good Morn America.The fallout from the last week will also hasten Mr. Strahan departur : An ABC spokeswoman confirm later on Tuesday that he would leav Live in two and a half week , about four month ahead of schedul .

The creator , they argu , ha remain anonym for year and the currency popular ha grown regardless .Mr. Wright is a lot like those veri difficult geek/nerd/blather that turn minor I.T . support into a social drama ,  Ian Grigg , a crypto-curr research , wrote in a blog entri .Satoshi wa more than a name , it wa a concept , a secret , a team , a vision . Now Satoshi live on in a new form  chang ,  he ad . Much of the secret is gone , but the vision is still there.In the world of cybercrim and encrypt , find the human behind the comput is the except , not the rule .The leaker of the Panama Paper , the trove of document that expos offshor account use by the rich and power , remain anonym . The digit culprit who stole more than $ 80 million from Bangladesh central bank remain at larg . And there is still no concret indic of the perpetr of the hack against Soni in 2014 .The creator of the illicit Internet market call the Silk Road , known in part for it relianc on Bitcoin , wa confirm onli by an oper in which he wa grab at a San Francisco librari with hi laptop open . Befor that , all that wa known about him wa an intrigu screen name : Dread Pirat Robert .The latest twist in Bitcoin origin stori is like to feed the power vacuum that ha plagu the virtual currenc .While a decentr natur is at Bitcoin core , it ha also led to intern reflect over it evolut . Bitcoin longtim backer have recent split over the proper way to expand the network .Found as a digit competitor to exist currenc , Bitcoin ha move more into the mainstream of late . Financi institut are put resourc into research how they can use the blockchain , the currency commun digit ledger , to make transact faster and cheaper . Competit , too , ha risen , with a host of new virtual currenc , like Ethereum . And the growth of the Bitcoin system ha stall .The mysteri of Bitcoin founder ha been central to it cachet ever sinc it surfac in 2009 . Yet the creator ha also been mostli silent sinc Bitcoin rose to promin .If Mr. Wright claim can be confirm , they open a whole new set of issu for Bitcoin . Doe it creator have more power than other who have play a major role in it develop ? If the founder assert author over it direct , doe that undercut the veri power of the currenc as a decentr system ?Mr. Wright revel wa made just befor a larg Bitcoin confer began in New York on Monday . After the announc , the price of Bitcoin fell about $ 10 .Satoshi , as the creator becam known , commun onli by electron messag and never reveal hi or her true ident befor cut off all commun in 2011 . That ha led to frequent specul about the ident of Satoshi  specul that ha so far prove wrong .In perhap the most notabl case , Newsweek claim in 2014 that the founder wa Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto , a physicist live in California . The revel fuel a reporter-driven car chase of Mr. Nakamoto across Lo Angel , an indic of the tabloid-level curios behind Bitcoin origin . Dorian Nakamoto eventu deni be the Bitcoin founder .If Mr. Wright is perpetr a hoax , it is a rather elabor one .To back up hi claim , the BBC said Mr. Wright had provid digit sign messag use cryptograph key inextric link to Bitcoin gener by Satoshi Nakamoto . Mr. Wright also post evid on hi blog , includ a technic walk through of how to verifi cryptograph key .I didnt take the decis lightli to make my ident public ,  Mr. Wright said in a news releas , and I want to be clear that Im do thi becaus I care so passion about my work.Soon after the stori were publish in Wire and Gizmodo , the Australian Feder Polic raid Mr. Wright home in suburban Sydney in connect with a tax investig . The Australian tax author said at the time that they had determin that Mr. Wright wa not Satoshi Nakamoto .Gavin Andresen , who succeed Satoshi Nakamoto as the lead Bitcoin develop , wrote Monday on hi blog that he believ Mr. Wright claim . Mr. Andresen ha push for a bigger Bitcoin , a strategi Mr. Wright also appear to back .After spend time with him , I am convinc beyond a reason doubt : Craig Wright is Satoshi ,  Mr. Andresen wrote . Dure our meet , I saw the brilliant , opinion , focus , gener  and privacy-seek  person that match the Satoshi I work with six year ago .But the Bitcoin commun wa not in consensu .Anoth of the lead develop work on Bitcoin basic softwar , Gregori Maxwel , said that the evid present by Mr. Wright wa not enough to convinc him . It demonstr no connect between thi person and Bitcoin creation ,  Mr. Maxwel wrote in an email to the Time .A programm who is in charg of the Bitcoin discuss board , Michael Marquardt , wrote on Reddit  under the screen name theymos  that Mr. Wright new write suggest an effort to deceiv the public . And the main Reddit page dedic to Bitcoin wa full of discuss on Monday about the legitimaci of Mr. Wright claim .Altogeth , the weight of the new evid tip the scale veri littl , and the scale were alreadi stack against him be Satoshi ,  said Jeremi Clark , an assist professor at the Concordia Institut for Inform System Engin in Montreal .', 'TOKYO  In a blow to Japan arm export ambit , Australia chose a French compani on Tuesday to suppli a dozen attack submarin for it navi , reject a bid from a Japanes consortium that had been seen as the front-runn .The deal , worth 50 billion Australian dollar , or $ 38.5 billion , is one of the biggest-ev defens contract in the Asia-Pacif region . And for a while , condit seem to be line up just right for the Japanes , who were look to put their little-known submarin industri on the global map .Japan and Australia , both island nation , reli on submarin for defens . Japan is adept at make the type of quiet-run , diesel-pow vessel the Australian sought . And just two year ago , Japan lift a self-impos ban on weapon export that it had maintain sinc the end of World War II .Japanes and Australian leader , meanwhil  mutual concern about the grow militari might of China  have been tout closer militari tie . In 2014 , Prime Minist Shinzo Abe of Japan and Toni Abbott , then the prime minist of Australia , sign a defens cooper agreement that mani saw as pave the way for a submarin sale .So Australia choic of the French compani , DCN , over the Japanes manufactur Mitsubishi Heavi Industri and Kawasaki Shipbuild wa more than a busi setback for Japan . A win for Mitsubishi and Kawasaki would not just have secur the first export by Japan of a major weapon system . It would also have been a turn point for Japan broader defens polici , which ha been mostli inward-look sinc it wartim defeat more than 70 year ago .The conserv Mr. Abe ha been tri to chang that by loosen decades-old legal restrict that have prevent the Japanes militari from engag in combat mission abroad , as well as by lift the ban on arm export .The French offer repres the capabl best abl to meet Australia uniqu need ,  Malcolm Turnbul , the current Australian prime minist , said in announc the decis in Adelaid , where the vessel will be built . Thi is secur the futur of Australia navi over decad to come.The French-design submarin will eventu replac Australia fleet of Collins-class submarin , which were built in the earli 1990 , also in Australia , base on a Swedish design . The French vessel are expect to enter servic in the earli 2030 .In an accompani written statement , Mr. Turnbul and Defens Minist Maris Payn said the French submarin offer superior sensor perform and stealth characterist , as well as rang and endur similar to the Collins-class submarine. Other consider were schedul , program execut , through-lif support and Australian industri involvement.A post-mortem had alreadi begun in Japan over the failur of the joint Mitsubishi-Kawasaki bid , after leak to the news media in Australia in recent week suggest the govern in Canberra wa cool on the Soryu-class submarin be offer by the two compani . They were propos to sell the Australian an enlarg version of the 4,200-ton Soryu , which is power by a combin of advanc diesel engin and lithium-ion batteri .Mitsubishi and Kawasaki have built eight of the submarin for the Japanes Navi , the Maritim Self-Defens Forc , and have order for 12 more . But they have never orchestr thi sort of multin build project , with assembl take place in a foreign shipyard  a requir of the Australian bid .Gen Nakatani , the Japanes defens minist , said he wa veri disappointed and would seek a detail explan from Australia for it choic . He ad that Australia would remain a special strateg partner.The Japanes compani have struggl to meet Australian request to modifi the Soryu to make it larger and give it longer rang , expert said , and appear less enthusiast than the French to share technic secret with the Australian contractor who would help build the submarin .The French were veri adroit in put forward a bid that that wa realli an industri play , as well as a technic propos ,  said Peter Jen , execut director of the Australian Strateg Polici Institut . As for the Japanes , he ad , there realli wa a risk in ask Japan to reloc an entir industri capabl for the first time in modern history.The success French propos involv swap an advanc diesel engin for the nuclear power plant normal use in a DCNS-made Barracuda-class submarin , a proven vessel that alreadi ha the size and rang the Australian were look for .The French state own about two-third of DCN , which is the country largest naval contractor , while most of the rest is held by the defens and aerospac group Thale . Jean-Yv Le Drian , the French defens minist , told Europ 1 radio on Tuesday that the deal wa a great victori for the French naval industry that would provid as mani as 4,000 job in the Cherbourg region , where the company shipyard have been struggl .Under the administr of former Presid Nicola Sarkozi , Franc built two Mistral-class helicopt carrier for the Russian Navi , but sanction impos by Western countri after Russia invad Crimea and Ukrain scuttl that deal .ThyssenKrupp Marin System of Germani had also bid for the Australian deal .Given the import of the submarin project to Australia  Mr. Turnbul call it a moment nation endeavor  the French bid ultim look like the least riski choic , Mr. Jen said . He ad that Australia might now look for other , smaller defens contract to open up to Japan , for instanc in sonar system , missil defens or cybersecur .Walk first , then run ,  Mr. Jen said .

We hadnt seen shock like thi becaus we were trade with rich countri , not highli product develop countri with enorm labor reserves.To understand the connect between import from China and polit polar , the research focus on the fact that manufactur tend to local in a specif region .There are these concentr pocket of hurt ,  Mr. Autor said , and wer see the polit consequ of that.Mr. Autor and Mr. Hanson emphas that trade is onli one factor among mani that have contribut to a polar Congress ( incom inequ is anoth , as are attitud toward immigr ) . But it ha been an import one , particularli over the last decad , when Chines import ramp up .Thi trade-induc polar ha had a signific effect on the overal ideolog makeup of Congress .The author found that voter in congression district hardest hit by Chines import tend to choos more ideolog extrem lawmak .Between 2002 and 2010 , district in the top 5th percentil of trade exposur , on averag , experienc a 19 percent greater drop in manufactur employ rel to district at the other end of the spectrum . Those hard-hit district becam , on averag , far more conserv : the ideolog equival of move from Marco Rubio to Ted Cruz .Some veri conserv member of Congress have been sympathet to free trade argument in the past , but Repres Brook , who ha welcom support from the Tea Parti , doesnt minc word about where he stand .Wer go to have to do whatev is necessari to ensur that a foreign countri isnt abl to success attack and destroy signific part of the economi ,  he said . I wa in China two week ago and they are go to clean our plow if we dont act.Mr. Autor , like most economist , is still persuad of the long-establish benefit that global trade confer on the economi as a whole . But he recogn that angri voter have valid reason to be frustrat .It a matter of diffus benefit and concentr cost , but our polit system hasnt address those cost ,  he said .Some staunch defend of global , like Gari Clyde Hufbauer , a senior fellow at the Peter G. Peterson Institut for Intern Econom in Washington , also acknowledg that the feder govern ha fail to adequ address the need of worker disloc by lower import barrier .But the benefit of free trade is 10 time the size of the loss ,  he said . Free trade realli help working-class peopl in term of lower price for product . The benefit are skew toward peopl with lower incom becaus they spend a much larger fraction of their incom on merchandise.Perhap , but that cold comfort to peopl in northern Alabama , where wage are stagnant and manufactur job are still disappear .In nearbi Decatur , the big Nucor steel plant is hang on , but it is under intens pressur from Asian import , said the company chief execut , John J.

Gross can not help notic the sleek offic tower that the bond giant Pimco move into in earli 2014 .Just a short walk up the road , the 20-stori build loom larg in the Southern California sun  a potent symbol of the rich and might that Pimco came to repres dure Mr. Gross long reign there as the bond king .Although he wa forc out nearli two year ago and ha move on to a rival , Janu Capit Group , Pimco remain veri , veri close  both physic and , it would appear , psycholog .We were a famili : Everyth I did wa for them ,  Mr . Gross said in hi whisperi , high-pitch voic . That is the most disappoint thing  it just didnt make busi sense.Pimco would disagre , even though $ 376 billion ha walk out the door sinc it wa decid in late 2014 that the firm would be better off without the man who wa the public face of the franchis .The troubl for Pimco doe not stop there . Mr . Gross ha file a lawsuit assert that he wa wrong termin , and he is seek $ 200 million  which he said he plan to donat to chariti . And , as he is onli too happi to point out , hi new vehicl , the Janu Global Unconstrain Fund , is handili beat it counterpart at Pimco .In a world where a portfolio manager abil to outperform repres the truest measur of worth , these result have invigor Mr . Gross .I am fixat on prove that they were wrong ,  he said . It like  no , you shouldnt have done that and the number will prove it.Pimco is no less fixat on him . Thi month , Pimco file a legal respons to Mr. Gross suit , rebut hi alleg .The turmoil wa tie to the abrupt departur in 2014 of Moham El-Erian , who had been set to succeed Mr . Gross .The account of Mr. Gross conduct were describ by peopl who have work with him at the firm , but who spoke on the condit of anonym .Furiou at the betray , Mr . Gross want to dock Mr. El-Erian pay and provok him into su Pimco , which , he believ , would hurt hi chanc of get anoth job , those peopl said . Pimco execut reject the idea  as well as a demand that they lie to a newspap report to present him in a better light , they said .Even with the punish toll of that turmoil  outflow , layoff and a batter reput  firm leader say they have no regret .Still , while they have strive to assur concern client that Pimco is move on , Mr. Gross abil to remain squar in the public eye , via the legal fight and now a campaign to promot hi superior perform , is drive them to distract .Michael Reid , a spokesman , said , The entir 240-member portfolio manag team compet in the financi market everi day with the goal of gener strong risk-manag return on behalf of our clients.Patricia Glaser , Mr. Gross lawyer , said the assert were untru : Pimco seem to have a problem get their stori straight . It is now acknowledg they push Bill out , instead of their previou claim that Bill walk away from the company.That the disput ha becom a mind game of sort doe not seem to bother Mr . Gross .Unlik ani other fund manag , Mr . Gross , who major in psycholog at Duke , put himself on the couch for the world to see . In hi invest letter , he ha reveal such intimaci as the erot pleasur of a good sneez , hi failur in colleg to get a girl into the back seat of hi car and how sad he wa when hi cat die .Convent bore him : That is whi he will stand on hi head when the urg hit and wear a silk tie as a scarf , drape loos around hi neck .So it is no revel for him to own up to obsess behavior in term of how hi $ 1.3 billion fund is fare against it Pimco counterpart .Mr . Gross , 71 , is not tether to hi phone , so when Bloomberg publish the daili result of hi fund at 3 p.m. California time , he will drop hi golf club and rush to the offic to get the news .The first thing he say he doe when arriv home ( after kiss hi wife , Sue , of cours ) : Check the Bloomberg . At night he will wake up as mani as three time to check on global market , he say .He is not abov poke fun at himself , though . At a recent golf tournament he wa pair  to hi surpris  against Michael Gomez , a young Pimco execut known to be close to hi nemesi , Mr. El-Erian .I realli want to win  but yeah , they kill us ,  he said , laugh loudli .Sinc Mr . Gross offici took control of hi fund on Oct. 6 , 2014 , he is up 1.8 percent , compar with Pimco Unconstrain , which is down 1.64 percent , accord to Morningstar .Make it all the sweeter is the fact that Daniel J. Ivascyn , one of the execut who led the effort to oust him and then took over as chief invest offic , is an execut of the fund . Mr. Ivascyn , who manag the better-perform Pimco Incom Fund , is not a primari manag on the vehicl .Mi whole even is depend on whether I beat them ,  Mr . Gross said . You see , I have to prove it all over again . Everi day.Despit thi favor run , money ha not flood in . One of hi larger investor , Georg Soro , last year remov $ 490 million from hi oversight .Of the $ 1.3 billion in the fund , about half is Mr. Gross own money .Money is hold out ,  said Todd Rosenbluth , a mutual fund specialist at Standard & Poor Global Market Intellig . I think there is legitim market skeptic that he can do thi on hi own  without a Pimco team support him.Mr . Gross contend the main reason that hi bond fund ha been win the day is that Pimco ha been make bold play on emerg market bond and inflation-link secur , wager that central bank activ will stimul global growth .For some time now , he ha been argu that with rate at zero or neg , central bank have virtual no abil to spur growth .They are bet on reflat , while I am skeptic of it ,  he said .Mr . Gross , ha , in effect , taken the opposit side of thi wager by build a portfolio that pay off if there are no global market shock , like interest rate increas or a larg countri go bust .Of cours , such a strategi carri danger . Mr . Gross ha made some big bet that Brazil and Mexico will not default by sell investor credit-default swap , deriv instrument that would forc him to disburs larg sum if these countri go belli up .Such derivative-fuel bet on financi stabil can backfir when market go haywir . Last year , hi Janu fund experienc sever sharp drop in price , which preced Mr. Soros decis to withdraw hi fund .Thi is not a riskless strategi ,  Mr . Gross acknowledg .He is also under no illus that hi good run is perman .So he is enjoy it fruit while they last . And if he ha becom fanat about beat the guy across the street , so what ? He is convinc that fealti to the screen , not to mention daili yoga stretch , is what keep him feel youth .In fact , over the year , Mr . Gross ha consist ask one question of prospect employe : What drive you ?The twist is that they must pick one of three answer : money , power or fame .Strang to him , no one ha ever pick fame .It is the one thing I have alway want ,  he said . When I wa start out at Pimco in 1972 , I told my mother and father that I wa go to becom the most famou bond manag in the world.That he did , but then came the fall .When you write my obituari I dont want you to mention that I wa fire by Pimco ,  he said . I want you to write that I wa a great investor  so mayb I am not over it.', 'A recent histori of mistak , slip-up and manag blunder is woven into the fabric of Tribun Publish , the struggl publish of The Lo Angel Time and The Chicago Tribun .Now , the compani may be about to add to the list .On Monday , Gannett , publish of USA Today , disclos an eye-pop $ 815 million bid for what is left of the Tribun publish empir . But instead of Tribune board pop Champagn cork and shout Hallelujah , it told Gannett , astonishingli , in effect : Wait . Wer not sure we want to do that and , actual , wer not sure we even want to talk to you about it.Two week ago and behind the scene , Gannett made it bid , valu at $ 12.25 a share , known to Tribune board in the form of a privat letter . That 63 percent higher than Friday share price . At most public compani that at least pretend to think about their sharehold , a firm that get an unsolicit offer hire banker rel quickli to sort out it option . And perhap it engag in a bit of back-and-forth with the suitor in hope of feel them out and mayb get an even higher bid .Not Tribun .It board sat on the offer for nearli 10 day without retain outsid advis . Then , Tribun wrote Gannett a letter say it wa still work on hire outsid advis , but is in the midst of signific transform ,  and point out that the compani will undergo some change after June 2 , almost six week from now .While Tribun said it would evaluate the bid , the clear takeaway wa that it want more time .You might ask , what magic about June 2 ? That is the day of Tribune annual meet .More import , it is the day that two of Tribune board member step down . When that happen , Michael Ferro , an entrepreneur with next to no media experi who invest in the compani earlier thi year and becam the company nonexecut chairman , will have effect mount a coup of the board .Here how he did it . In Februari , Mr. Ferro compani invest $ 44.4 million in Tribun . In exchang , Mr. Ferro wa given a seat on the board , bring the board to seven peopl .Mr. Ferro then persuad the board to fire Tribune chief execut , Jack Griffin , a media veteran , who wa also a director . Mr. Ferro replac him with Justin Dearborn , a former health care technolog execut with zero experi in media . So , between him and Mr. Dearborn , he now control two seat on the board .He then press the board to expand to 10 peopl and ad three peopl friendli to him  all , again , with no meaning background in journal . They are Carol Crenshaw , chief financi offic of the Chicago Commun Trust ; Richard A. Reck , founder and presid of Busi Strategi Advisor ; and Donald Tang , a former banker who now run a boutiqu focus on Unit States-China media deal .So now he ha five friendli director on a 10-person board . But after June 2 , when two previou director step down , he will have a major  five of eight .Tribun will tell you these director are all independ . That true onli insofar as they are not execut work at the compani . But they are certainli insid rel to Mr. Ferro .If Mr. Ferro , who said thi year , I wouldnt sell for $ 50 a share ,  accord to Ken Doctor on NiemanLab , can get past June 2 without a deal , he will probabl have the leeway to fulli direct the process . He could choos to negoti or perhap he could stonewal . He could even tri to take the compani privat himself . Who know ?Whatev the case , the idea that Tribune board ha allow thi sort of behavior to take place is alarm . Given that Tribun Publish wa just spun off from Tribun Media and itself wa a product of bankruptci thank to Sam Zell mismanag of the compani , it hard to argu that thi compani deserv the benefit of the doubt .Lanc Vitanza , a media analyst at CRT , put it best . Tribun Publish ha littl histori oper as an independ public compani and may be unabl to reach earn target ,  he wrote in a note to investor . Recent manag upheav creat numer risk with respect to strategi and execut go forward.If your think to yourself , well , Tribun is a journal compani and simpli sell to the highest bidder shouldnt be the onli consider , your right . Tribun shouldnt consid onli dollar and cent . In thi case , Gannett is offer Tribun a lifelin with potenti to creat a modicum of stabil .It is hard to believ that Gannett offer is it last , or best . A compani that is will to go public with a bid is usual will to bid more . Of cours , there a chanc that Tribun is engag in an inscrut courtship danc that will land a higher price . Well onli know if Tribun first pick up the phone .', 'For year , New York  a citi not accustom to be second banana  ha look on as Silicon Valley ha solidifi it influenc over the technolog industri .Sure , New York ha ad ten of thousand of good-pay tech job while the Wall Street job engin ha sputter . And the city start-up pull in $ 1.94 billion in ventur fund in the first three month of thi year , the most for ani quarter in five year and second onli to Silicon Valley , accord to the research firm CB Insight .But the big hit  the next Googl or Facebook or even Salesforc , a powerhous in onlin servic for busi  ha prove elus .To improv the odd of foster that next big thing in New York , execut at tech start-up , big tech compani and ventur firm are creat a new polici and advocaci organ , Tech : NYC . The nonprofit will be formal announc at an event thi week .Tech : NYC ha no set agenda yet . But it approach , said Juli Samuel , the execut director , will be to work earli with citi , state and feder offici on issu that affect tech compani , befor law are pass . Some broader issu like tax , school and afford hous also help determin whether peopl want to work and live in a citi .New York is in a competit to be where start-up are go to locat and bigger tech compani are go to grow second and third offic ,  Ms. Samuel said .The new organ arriv at a time when the path ahead for the local tech economi is uncertain . New York , it seem , ha becom fertil ground for start-up , but ha veri few breakout winner .There have been some notabl failur . In the last two year , Fab , an e-commerc marketplac for design furnitur , housewar and other merchandis , and Quirki , an onlin network for inventor , both collaps , lose hundr of million of dollar for ventur investor .Silicon Valley ventur firm suffer some of the biggest loss on those New York start-up .In Januari , Foursquar , a social app that use locat technolog , rais $ 45 million , but at a price that cut it valuat nearli in half . And the Gilt Group , a fashion e-commerc servic , wa sold to the Hudson Bay Compani , the depart store conglomer that own Sak Fifth Avenu , for $ 250 million , about quarter of it onetim valuat .Start-up are inher riski . That is whi ventur capit firm invest in a broad portfolio of compani , so a few winner can make up for the loser .In New York , it is not the setback that stand out as much as the scarciti of lucr payday  start-up sold to the public or to other corpor for $ 1 billion or more .There have been a few over the year . In 2007 , for exampl , Googl paid $ 3.1 billion for DoubleClick , an onlin ad-serv servic . In 2013 , Yahoo bought Tumblr , a microblog platform , for $ 1.1 billion . Last year , Etsi , an onlin marketplac for handmad and vintag good , went public at a valuat of $ 1.8 billion , and trade abov that for a while but ha sinc retreat .Yet those are except . Big exit realli havent happen yet in New York ,  said Fred Wilson , co-found of Union Squar Ventur , a New York ventur capit firm . It a valid criticism.That should gradual chang , he argu , as the New York tech commun matur . Mr. Wilson also said that New York entrepreneur were influenc by the trade cultur of Wall Street . They are more inclin , he said , to build a compani , sell it , cash in and move to the next one than some Silicon Valley entrepreneur who dream bigger and view their compani as their life work .A studi last year by Compass , a research firm , point to the potenti of New York , and to how far behind the Bay Area it is . The studi look at variou factor includ the fund , market reach , talent pool and start-up experi of variou locat to come up with a rank of global start-up ecosystem ,  exclud China , Japan and South Korea .New York rank second over all , but wa way behind by some measur . Compass estim the valu of all Bay Area start-up  includ sale to compani , public offer and privat valuat  at $ 264 billion to $ 323 billion . The compar estim for New York start-up wa $ 41 billion to $ 50 billion .Still , the New York tech economi ha shown impress job growth . An analysi by Jason Bram , a research at the Feder Reserv Bank of New York , conclud that from 2007 to 2015 New York tech employ grew by more than 60 percent , to 126,170 worker . By contrast , tech employ in the Bay Area wa more than 370,000 as of 2014 , the most recent figur in the Fed analysi .The gap is hardli surpris , given Silicon Valley decades-long head start and singular focu . Technolog innov and entrepreneurship  that our busi in the Valley ,  said Steve Blank , an entrepreneur who lectur on technolog and innov at Stanford , Columbia and New York Univers .In New York , Mr. Blank said , tech start-up have been layer on top of the city exist industri ,  includ advertis , media and financ .But New York is increasingli a place for the deeper comput scienc for which Silicon Valley is known . Facebook , for exampl , ha a larg artifici intellig lab in New York , head by Yann LeCun , who is also a professor at N.Y.U . And there are now A.I . start-up in New York , includ Clarifai and Geometr Intellig .Columbia and N.Y.U . have also strengthen their engin depart and ad program in new field like data scienc and machin learn , and are increasingli work with start-up and nurtur spinoff ventur . Cornel Tech , found in Manhattan in 2012 , is dedic to tech entrepreneurship .And tech giant like Facebook , Googl and IBM have been aggress hire engin talent for their New York outpost .Nathan Richardson , chief execut of Trade It , a financi technolog start-up in New York , ha work in the Bay Area and in New York . Until recent , New York wa regard in Silicon Valley as a place to find busi , advertis and web design talent .But you didnt recruit engin in New York ,  Mr. Richardson said . That chang dramatically.For some New York tech start-up , the proxim to the industri they serv is essenti . Sprinklr , for exampl , provid cloud softwar that allow major brand like Nike and McDonald to monitor their reput and market on social network like Facebook , Instagram and Twitter .Sprinklr work close with the New York advertis and market commun .

Hi start-up ha rais $ 125 million in ventur fund and is valu at $ 1 billion .After Charl Phillip took over as chief execut at Infor , a busi softwar compani , he decid to move the headquart to New York . Infor had been base in Atlanta , mainli becaus of the previou manag team .So Infor wa destin to reloc , and sinc it had hundr of develop in the Bay Area , the board assum the move would be there . They thought I wa crazi choos New York , but they went along with it ,  recal Mr. Phillip , onc a senior execut at Oracl .New York , he figur , wa closer to mani of it corpor custom , make in-person meet more conveni . And becaus Infor softwar wa be overhaul for eas of use , he ha hire softwar develop from New York advertis compani and fashion hous as well as the Parson School of Design and the Fashion Institut of Technolog .Wev pick up some great programm who understand design ,  Mr. Phillip said .

But the Copyright Act allow judg to award a reason attorney fee to the prevail party.Feder appeal court appli differ standard in decid when fee award in copyright case are warrant . The judg in Mr. Kirtsaeng case , in New York , award him noth , reli on a decis from the feder appeal court there that focus on whether the lose side posit had been object reasonable.The publish easili met that standard , the judg said , as it had won a $ 600,000 judgment against Mr. Kirtsaeng , won an appeal and lost in the Suprem Court by a 6-to-3 vote .E.

The Copyright Act , he said , also sought to ensur that peopl su for copyright infring did not fold at the outset .It want to encourag parti to advanc import principl even where the other side argument are good ; inde , I would say , especi where the other side argument are good ,  he said . When a defend is tri to decid whether to fight for a principl , the avail of attorneys fee can make all the differ in that decis , and in turn can make all the differ in whether the public right are vindicated.Sever justic appear unpersuad by the argument .

In gener , though , she said she wonder whether make it easier for the side to recov legal fee i not go to harm the Kirtsaeng of the world.Paul M. Smith , a lawyer for Wiley , made a similar point , say that make it easi for the winner to recov fee would suppress litigation.Peopl simpli arent go to keep fight ,  Mr. Smith said .

Even with econom growth slacken , and other energi sourc take hold , new coal plant have been ad .Now Beij is tri to slow thing down .In guidelin releas on Monday , China halt plan for new coal-fir power station in mani part of the countri , and construct of some approv plant will be postpon until at least 2018 .The announc , by the Nation Develop and Reform Commiss and the Nation Energi Administr , mean that about 200 plan coal-fir power gener  those seek approv and those approv but not yet under construct  may not be complet , said Lauri Myllyvirta , who analyz China energi product for Greenpeac .The total of 105 gigawatt of power those plant would have been abl to produc is consider more than the electricity-gener capac of Britain from all sourc .That a big chunk of power ,  said Bob Hodg , a coal specialist with IH Energi , a consult firm . It a lot of power . It a heck of a lot of power.Electr gener from fossil fuel like coal is the biggest singl contributor global to the rise in carbon emiss , which scientist say is caus the earth temperatur to rise . Leader from 175 countri , includ China , gather in New York on Friday to sign the Pari climat accord , which aim to halt and eventu revers the rise in carbon emiss , keep the increas in global temperatur below 2 degre Celsiu , or 3.6 degre Fahrenheit .China , by far the world biggest emitt of greenhous gass , is aim to reach a peak in carbon emiss by 2030 . A recent econom slowdown , polici to discourag coal-fir power plant near big citi , and a huge invest in wind and solar energi capac help reduc coal use in China last year .But even as coal becom unpopular in China , the country biggest state-own electr gener are ad new coal-fir power plant at a pace not seen in a decad , said Mr. Myllyvirta of Greenpeac , which is acknowledg as an authorit analyst of China energi product . Such plant add to exist overcapac , he said .The announc doe not stop project alreadi under construct , which amount to about 190 gigawatt of new coal-fir power gener , he said .It definit a posit step , but it not even enough to prevent the overcapac from get wors ,  Mr. Myllyvirta said .While the curb on new coal project , if rigor enforc , may help China meet it long-term goal on climat chang and air pollut , the primari motiv for the move appear to be short-term econom consider .In the face of the slowest econom growth in a quarter-centuri , electr demand ha fallen so sharpli in China that some coal-burn power plant are oper onli 40 or 50 percent of the time . Construct of wind turbin and solar panel ha also eaten slightli into the market share of the coal plant .Yet in China highli regul power industri , market signal are weak , and plan and construct of new power plant had continu apac , push forward by local govern eager for the construct job and expand tax base . With it new decre , the central govern seem to be tri to halt the develop of power plant that might well be underus if they were built .Mr. Hodg , the consult at IH Energi , said that as of two week ago , there were 1,200 new coal-fir plant on the draw board in 59 countri , mostli in Asia , and China wa the singl largest contributor .In my opinion , if they need the power , they would build them ,  he said of China . I think if you are Beij , and you dont need the power , you can delay them until you might need them . They are not scrap them.The guidelin , date March 17 , state that 13 provinc and region , includ top coal produc like Shanxi and Inner Mongolia , as well as the southern econom powerhous of Guangdong , should strictli control new capac , delay the approv of new project until after 2017 . A slightli longer list of provinc  15 , with consider overlap  were told to put off construct of approv project that had not yet broken ground .In both instanc , an except ha been made for project aim at the people livelihood ,  a phrase that wa not explain but may includ measur like provid steam heat to home in wintertim .The govern announc also call for an acceler of the close of outdat coal-fir plant that use older , dirtier technolog . But China is ad about 1 gigawatt in coal-fir capac a week , Mr. Myllyvirta said , as compani that have easi access to loan from state bank build new plant .That is in stark contrast to the Unit State , the world second-biggest carbon emitt , where it ha becom increasingli difficult to build new coal-fir plant under the Obama administr .Last year , almost 14 gigawatt of coal-fir capac wa retir in the Unit State , accord to the Energi Inform Administr in Washington . At the same time , there are onli six new coal-fir plant on the draw board in the Unit State through at least the next five year , with a total capac of less than 2 gigawatt , accord to the agenc .In China , howev , as coal price drop , the big state-own electr gener are benefit becaus highli regul electr price have not fallen in tandem .Becaus of the polit power of the coal industri and the fall price of coal , larger percentag of wind- and solar-gener electr are not be put on the grid , a phenomenon call curtail . To combat thi , the Chines govern ha recent issu a direct for oper of coal-fir plant to pay oper of wind and solar plant whose electr is not use , the Paulson Institut , a polici group focus on China and base in Chicago that wa found by the former Treasuri secretari , Henri M.

Howev , some of the panel member had troubl reconcil the often compel patient testimoni with the F.D.A . legal requir .I wa just basic torn between my mind and my heart ,  said Richard P. Hoffmann , a pharmacist who wa the consum repres on the committe and who abstain .Dr. Bruce I. Ovbiagel , chairman of neurolog at the Medic Univers of South Carolina , vote against approv but said , Base on all I heard , the drug definit work , but the question wa frame differently.On anoth question of whether the drug could qualifi for so-cal acceler approv , a lower hurdl , the panel vote 7 to 6 against the drug .The F.D.A. , which doe not have to follow the advic of it advisori panel , is schedul to decid whether to approv eteplirsen by May 26 .The controversi over eteplirsen is perhap the most vivid exampl of how patient and patient advoc are play a grow role in the F.D.A. evalu of drug . Thi can result in intens pressur on the agenc to approv drug .The muscular dystrophi commun is particularli well organ and ha lobbi the agenc for year to approv the drug , includ get member of Congress to write letter to the agenc .Hundr of patient and famili member show up for the meet , includ more than 40 parent who came from Britain and said they would move their famili to the Unit State if eteplirsen wa approv .So mani peopl were expect that the F.D.A . had to chang to a larger locat , a hotel ballroom in Hyattsvil , Md . Even that room wa fill to capac , includ with some boy in wheelchair .The public testimoni from patient , parent and doctor took more than three hour , much more than the one hour that is typic for advisori committe meet .Im not onli not get wors , Im get better ,  Austin LeClair , a teenag in a wheelchair said of the drug , which ha allow him to rais hi arm abov hi head and to feed himself more easili . It time to listen to the real expert ,  he said .The advoc said that sinc the drug appear to be safe , there is no reason not to make it avail to boy and young men who have littl to lose .The worst thing you can do is deni access to a drug and then find out it work  too late , after we have lost a gener of boy ,  Debra Miller , chief execut of the advocaci group CureDuchenn told the panel .Dr. Billi Dunn , the director of the F.D.A. divis of neurolog product , open the meet by say that the agenc wa highli sensit to the urgency of find drug for muscular dystrophi . Still , he said , the F.D.A . wa bound by law to approv drug onli if there wa substanti evidence of effect .These word are not vagu word to be defin accord to whim or fashion ,  he said . Anecdot and emot do not chang the data with which we are confront , no matter the attend ,  he ad .About 9,000 to 12,000 American , virtual all boy , are estim to have Duchenn muscular dystrophi . Becaus of genet mutat , peopl with the diseas make littl or no dystrophin , a protein that act as a shock absorb to protect muscl from deterior . Boy with Duchenn typic need wheelchair by their teen and die by their late 20 .Eteplirsen use a novel technolog , call exon skip , which seek to partial correct the genet defect , allow muscl cell to produc a somewhat function form of dystrophin . If approv , the drug would be applic to onli 13 percent of Duchenn patient . But other exon-skip drug are be develop for patient with differ mutat .One reason Sarepta main clinic trial involv onli 12 boy wa appar that the compani lack the abil to manufactur more when it start out .A competitor , GlaxoSmithKlin , which wa develop a similar drug , did a random trial involv 186 boy , one third of whom were given a placebo . ( That drug , now own by BioMarin Pharmaceut , did not prove effect in that studi and fail to win F.D.A . approv . )The F.D.A . strongli urg Sarepta to do a larger studi with a placebo control to better determin whether the drug work .But the compani , base in Cambridg , Mass. , argu that it would be uneth and impract to do so , sinc earli hint of effect meant that parent would no longer enrol their son in a trial where they might not get the drug .Instead , Sarepta compar the data from the 12 boy treat with eteplirsen to histor data from patient in Itali and Belgium who were as close match as possibl in diseas characterist .The main measur wa how far the boy could walk in six minut . After four year of weekli infus of eteplirsen , the boy in Sarepta studi could walk on averag 162 meter further  almost two footbal field  than the boy in Itali and Belgium . Ten of the 12 boy on the drug were still abl to walk after four year , versu onli three of 13 in the control group .Fifteen-year-old boy like Billi dont maintain ambul by accid ,  Dr. Jerri Mendel , director of the center for gene therapi at Nationwid Children Hospit in Columbu and lead investig in Sarepta studi , told the committe , after show a video of one 15-year-old on the drug .The F.D.A . staff , howev , said that comparison to histor data can be mislead . There have been mani case , it said , in which drug or medic devic look good compar with histor data but were not effect in a random trial against a placebo .The F.D.A . staff said the walk abil of the boy treat with eteplirsen wa within the rang of natur variat for that diseas and did not show the drug work . It also said that it wa uncertain whether the drug led to increas dystrophin product , but even if it did , the boy still had onli about 1 percent of normal level , an amount unlik to be benefici .Trade in share of Sarepta wa halt throughout the day .Patient have long press for approv of drug that the F.D.A . found onli margin effect , if at all . Critic say that approv drug that do not realli work is offer fals hope to patient and remov an incent for drug compani to develop better product .But patient input ha now been intensifi . Thi is partli becaus of social media , which make it easier for patient to organ . In addit , the F.D.A. , in respons to a 2012 law , ha becom more systemat in consid patient input . It ha been meet with patient with differ diseas and work to evalu drug partli base on outcom that patient say are meaning to them , not just those specifi by the drug compani .', 'WASHINGTON  Feder regul on Monday move to approv Charter Communications $ 65.5 billion acquisit of Time Warner Cabl and Bright Hous Network , enabl the creation of a new cabl giant as the industri focus more on broadband as tradit TV declin .Yet , the order to approv the deal were coupl with mani restrict that illustr how regul are increasingli use their power to further polici goal that are not cover by current regul for the industri . The Feder Commun Commiss and Justic Depart impos mandat on the acquisit aim at protect stream video compani and provid cheaper broadband servic to low-incom famili , some of which go far beyond regul for the entir cabl and Internet sector .The condit are meant to ensur competit in the nascent onlin video busi and to spread Internet connect given that broadband ha been deem a util . Attach the restrict could blunt the power of the combin Charter entiti , which becom the country second-largest broadband provid with 19.4 million user and the third-largest cabl televis provid with 17.4 million custom .The cumul impact of these condit will be to provid addit protect for new form of video program servic offer over the Internet ,  Tom Wheeler , chairman of the F.C.C. , said in a statement . He ad that there would be an independ monitor to ensur complianc with the condit .Mr. Wheeler circul hi approv order to other F.C.C . commission and wa expect to get enough vote to close the deal . The deal still await final approv from regul in California .The move to approv Charter acquisit is the latest develop in the fast-consolid cabl industri . Over the last few year , the industri ha greatli shift from a busi control by hundr of region outfit to one control by three major player  Comcast , Charter and Altic , the European compani that recent made a deal for Cablevis  that wield more heft over the country broadband and entertain infrastructur . That heft give the compani more leverag in negoti with TV compani over program and distribut deal , as well as more leverag over what cross their broadband pipe and the futur of onlin video .Each player ha a lot more scale to shape broadband and onlin video go forward ,  said Ami Yong , an analyst with Macquari . About 80 to 90 percent of broadband home are now in the home of three player . It is start to look like a tri-opoly.In the last year , the F.C.C . ha also increasingli use condit impos on merger approv to advanc it regulatori goal . In approv the merger between AT & T ; and DirecTV last year , for instanc , regul requir a build out of more broadband servic to million of household and the offer of cheaper broadband option for low-incom home .Thi time , the F.C.C . and Justic Depart ask Charter to agre to abstain from negoti with programm that would keep show and movi off compet stream servic like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video .Charter also promis that for seven year it would not impos data cap on broadband user who can run up big bill when watch onlin video , and that it would not charg compani like Netflix extra to connect to Charter custom . In addit , Charter agre to expand it Internet footprint to two million more home and to offer a cheaper broadband servic to low-incom household .Justin Venech , a Charter spokesman , said in a statement that the condit ensur the company current consumer-friendli and pro-broadband busi practic ,  ad that the combin entiti will be a lead competitor in the broadband and video markets.Regulatori approv would be a major win for Charter , which had circl Time Warner Cabl for the last three year . Comcast step in with a rival bid for Time Warner Cabl that collaps under regulatori pressur last year . After that , Charter announc it pair of deal for Time Warner Cabl and Bright Hous in May 2015 .The approv will have enorm implic on the telecommun , media and technolog ecosystem , with the combin compani set to have greater influenc over program price , new technolog in broadband infrastructur , and busi model emerg in stream video . Consum have also come to reli on the Internet as a util , but see price increas with few option for provid .The prospect of so much combin power by a few compani ha drawn protest from consum group and some tech compani , most notabl Dish Network , which fear it Sling TV stream video servic could be threaten by the Charter merger .On Monday , Dish declin to comment on the regulators move to approv the Charter deal . Dish is part of the Stop Mega Cabl Coalit , which wa form to rais awar of the harm that could result from the deal , and which on Monday said in a statement that the condit propos by the F.C.C . fell short of address all of the threat to competit and consum pose by thi transaction.The coalit said Charter should be requir to offer a stand-alon broadband servic .Other critic the F.C.C. condit of approv as overreach . At first blush , it appear that the commiss may have oper well outsid the four corner of the merger applic to pursu unrel matter and polici ,  Michael ORielli , a Republican commission for the agenc , said in a statement .Some consum advoc also oppos ani approv of the deal , fear that a combin entiti would elimin competit and increas price for custom .Creat broadband monopoli market rais consum cost , kill competit , and point a gun at the heart of the news and inform that democraci depend upon ,  Michael Copp , a former Democrat member of the F.C.C . and a special advis to the Common Caus public interest group , wrote in an email . F.C.C . approv of thi unnecessari merger would be an abandon of it public interest responsibilities.The F.C.C . ha the broad mandat of protect the public interest , which give it the abil to creat condit that may seem unrel to antitrust review but could make a deal good for consum , said Gene Kimmelman , a former antitrust offici at the Justic Depart who is now presid of Public Knowledg , a nonprofit media advocaci group .Offer to extend their broadband footprint and offer subsid broadband to some low incom custom further exist F.C.C . polici effort and serv the public interest ,  he said .', 'BERLIN  The trans-Atlant debat over digit privaci right versu the surveil need of intellig agenc wa put under a spotlight on Monday , as Presid Obama call for continu access by law enforc offici to thwart terror , while some European privaci advoc urg greater restraint .I want to say thi to young peopl who valu their privaci and spend a lot of time on their phone : The threat of terror is real ,  Mr. Obama said , speak at a trade show in Hanov , Germani .Iv work to reform our surveil program to ensur that theyr consist with the rule of law and uphold our valu , like privaci  and , by the way , we includ the privaci of peopl outsid of the Unit State ,  he ad .Mr. Obama messag come at a sensit time , as citi like Brussel and Pari are still recov from recent terrorist attack .

It would also allow the target sharehold to escap flatlin revenu at a headline-grab 63 percent premium to it current market valu .Gannett ha been on a buy spree sinc it wa broken off from it American local broadcast divis , now known as Tenga , last June . It snap up the owner of The Milwauke Journal Sentinel , for exampl , for about $ 300 million thi month . The compani disclos on Monday that it approach Tribun , the publish of The Lo Angel Time and The Chicago Tribun , about a deal on April 12 . Gannett chief execut , Bob Dickey , said that so far he had been disappointed by the respons .It understand that Tribun Publish , led by Justin C. Dearborn , might initi be shi of new owner yet again . The compani , base in Chicago , ha never fulli recov from the disastr $ 13 billion sale to the real estat mogul Sam Zell almost a decad ago . Tribun Publish took on so much debt that the compani went bankrupt a year later and did not emerg until 2012 .The compani ha also just undergon yet anoth manag chang , instig after Michael Ferro becam it largest sharehold in Februari .

The main question that remain is whether ani individu insid the compani will be prosecut in the Unit State for instal of the defeat device design to make certain diesel engin appear to compli with feder and state environment law when in fact they did not .Pay out the money is probabl the easiest part of the resolut for Volkswagen becaus those cost can be spread out over the next year or two . Moreov , it can deduct some of the payment from it tax as a busi expens as well , cushion the damag to it bottom line at least a littl bit .How will the $ 18 billion be spent ? Although the final total could rise , here are some rough estim of how thi pool could be divid .The New York Time report that the cost of buy back the diesel car with the affect engin ha been peg at approxim $ 7 billion , cite an estim by Kelley Blue Book , an automobil research firm .There could be addit compens paid to owner for the loss of use of their vehicl , plu Volkswagen will have to pay for fix car in Europ and other countri , which will not be as costli becaus they do not have the same stringent environment requir as the Unit State . Add in anoth billion dollar for those expens , and it add up to about $ 8 billion to get the diesel car fix and their owner compens .The penalti that will have to be paid to the Justic Depart and feder regul , along with attorney gener in the state and the California Air Resourc Board , which help uncov the cheat , can be expect to run into the billion of dollar .Gener Motor paid a $ 900 million penalti for problem relat to faulti ignit switch , while Toyota paid $ 1.2 billion for mislead statement about defect in it car . Those case were resolv through defer prosecut agreement with the Justic Depart , so the compani avoid a crimin convict .Feder prosecutor could take a harder line with Volkswagen by demand a guilti plea becaus of indic that it fail to report the emiss cheat and initi claim that it wa in complianc with the law . Either resolut mean a crimin fine can be expect , and it is like to exceed the amount Toyota paid .The Environment Protect Agenc could impos penalti of as much as $ 18 billion for the use of the defeat devic . The Justic Depart ha also been look at possibl civil violat of the Financi Institut Reform , Recoveri , and Enforc Act , known as Firrea , for possibl fraud by the compani affect bank that purchas secur packag loan to buyer of it car . The amount of ani penalti under that provis could be the profit on the transact , which could exceed a billion dollar .The Feder Trade Commiss su Volkswagen over it advertis promot the environment benefit of it diesel engin , anoth front that could produc signific penalti . Add in the investig by the state into whether their own consum protect law were broken , and the total amount on the civil side is like to exceed the crimin fine Volkswagen ha to pay .A rule of thumb in secur fraud settlement is that the penalti should match the harm caus to the victim , in thi case the owner of car with the defeat devic along with ani environment damag . Use that approach would indic that the fine and civil penalti could total about $ 8 billion , although if the compani can convinc the Justic Depart that it ha been cooper then that figur may drop . How the money will be divid among the variou agenc is not of much interest to Volkswagen , as long as the payment make the investig disappear .That would leav roughli $ 2 billion avail for the compani to pay penalti to regul in Europ and other part of the world in which car equip with it diesel engin were sold .Add it all up , and Volkswagen $ 18 billion kitti should cover most of the cost it face from the emiss scandal , with the chanc to save a billion or two if it can show it wa cooper with the investig . Of cours , thi assum there are not ani new revel about use defeat devic or other environment issu with it vehicl .That will not be the end of the cheat stori for Volkswagen , howev , becaus there is also the issu of whether individu will be accus of wrongdo .In a statement issu on Friday , Volkswagen said it would not provid an interim updat on the statu of the intern investig becaus do so would present unaccept risk for Volkswagen and , therefor , can not take place now. Although the law firm retain to lead the review , Jone Day , ha conduct over 450 interview and look at million of document , there are still addit employe to speak with .The compani express concern that reveal what it ha learn to thi point would be a problem becaus individu who have yet to be question could align their statement with the content of the interim report. Get complet  and accur  inform is import becaus the compani is hope to receiv credit from the Justic Depart for it cooper , which could reduc the penalti it will have to pay .The price for be consid cooper these day requir identifi individu within the compani who are respons for the violat . A memorandum issu by Salli Q. Yate , the deputi attorney gener , in Septemb state that to receiv ani consider for cooperation a compani under investig must complet disclos to the depart all relev fact about individu misconduct.Accord to Volkswagen statement , disclos the inform gather to thi point could also jeopard the credit that Volkswagen may expect to receiv in the event of it full cooper with the Depart of Justice.In other word , it need to keep dig to provid the name of everyon who wa involv in the emiss cheat , and tip off who it ha identifi so far might make it difficult to pinpoint other who might be respons .If the Justic Depart think Volkswagen ha held back inform or taken shortcut in complet the investig , then the cost of ani settlement will increas by compound the percept that the compani wa less than forthcom when the emiss issu first aros . Get to the bottom of who wa respons , and whether anyon in senior manag wa awar of  or even encourag  the cheat , will be the litmu test of how much cooper credit Volkswagen receiv .Refer to obtain inform from individu insid the compani is a good indic that Volkswagen is tri to compli with the requir to aid the prosecut of it employe . If the Justic Depart plan to seek charg against individu , that rais the question of whether Germani would be will to extradit it citizen to the Unit State to face trial .The end may be in sight for Volkswagen , but there is still a long way to go for the compani . To the extent that it identifi those who it believ were respons for the emiss cheat , the case will continu as individu are much more like to fight charg than a compani , keep the scandal in the news .', 'CARLSBAD , Calif.

It can be seen as achiev an admir public health goal of less sugar consumpt or as a veri regress tax that fall more on the poor than the rich , sinc the poor tend to drink more soda .While not the biggest issu the two candid have tussl over , it is one that may reverber across the countri in come year as more citi and state use the tax to rais revenu or improv citizens health .Last week , Mrs. Clinton becam the first presidenti candid to explicitli endors a tax on sugari drink . At a Philadelphia event Wednesday , she said a propos there to use a soda tax to fund univers prekindergarten wa a good idea .It start earli with work with famili , work with kid , build up commun resourc ,  Mrs. Clinton said , accord to a CNN report . Im veri support of the mayor propos to tax soda to get univers preschool for kid . I mean , we need univers preschool . And if that a way to do it , that how we should do it.Mrs. Clinton frame of the issu as she campaign in the Pennsylvania primari echo that of Mayor Jim Kenney of Philadelphia , who ha emphas the soda tax as a way of fund educ . Mr. Kenney talk about the tax not as a way to drive down soda drink , but as one to help fight poverti in hi citi . In truth , it would probabl do some of both . Higher soda price , the like result of such a tax , would discourag peopl from buy as much soda . Public health reform think such a function of the tax is desir , sinc soda consumpt ha been link to obes , diabet and tooth decay .But there anoth way to view soda tax : as measur that hit the poor harder . Lower-incom Philadelphian , like other lower-incom American , tend to drink more soda than their richer neighbor . That mean that they may get stuck pay a disproportion share of the bill .Make sure that everi famili ha high-qual , afford preschool and child care is a vision that I strongli share ,  Mr. Sander said , in a written statement . On the other hand , I do not support pay for thi propos through a regress tax on soda that will significantli increas tax on low-incom and middle-class American . At a time of massiv incom and wealth inequ , it should be the peopl on top who see an increas in their tax , not low-incom and work people. Over the weekend , Mr. Sander continu to express opposit to the tax , at campaign event and on Meet the Press .The propos Philadelphia tax would be 3 cent for everi ounc of sugari drink sold by distributor , make it the highest soda tax propos anywher in the countri . That mean a tax of $ 4.32 on a 12-pack of soda , which typic cost between $ 3 and $ 6 at the groceri store . It would come to 60 cent of tax on a 20-ounc bottl , which usual retail for about $ 2 . It not yet clear whether distributor will absorb some of that tax or simpli pass all of it on to consum , but the citi budget depart expect big price increas in retail store .Mr. Sander also say Mrs. Clinton support violat her pledg not to rais tax on those earn less than $ 250,000 .Mr. Sanders argument is in line with that of mani soda tax oppon . And there most like some truth to it . Tobacco tax , in mani way the model for soda tax , have tend to fall larg on low-incom peopl , who remain more like to smoke .But tobacco is highli addict . In Mexico , where a big , nation soda tax went into effect in 2014 , soda drink declin the fastest among the poor , who felt the tax effect in their budget most acut . Consumpt among the poorest Mexican fell by 17 percent by the end of the year , compar with 12 percent in the popul nationwid . As Barri Popkin , a professor of nutrit at the Univers of North Carolina put it : The rich paid the tax , and the poor reduc their soda drink . If someth like that happen in Philadelphia , the poor may suffer in the form of less choic or enjoy , but they may not bear the brunt of fund citi preschool .Republican appear to be nearli unit in their opposit to the measur , both as a tax increas and a nanni state intrus on person choic . Sever promin Republican cheer Mr. Sanders anti-tax stanc , includ Grover Norquist , the presid of American for Tax Reform , and an influenti anti-tax advoc . But conserv opposit to soda tax is not true world over . In Britain , the Conserv govern just propos a hefti soda tax , which is expect to becom law .', 'Onli two month after the European Union top polici maker agre to a hard-won data-shar pact with Unit State offici , the bloc nation privaci regul said on Wednesday that the deal did not go far enough to safeguard the person inform of Internet user in Europ .The agreement , the so-cal E.U.-U.S. Privaci Shield , which would allow compani to continu send person data back and forth across the Atlant , is still wide expect to be ratifi by earli summer .

They also say they fear that American law enforc and intellig agenc might gain access to European citizens person inform without suffici safeguard in place .From the outsid , it must look like Europ cant speak with one voic on privaci ,  said Patrick van Eeck , a data protect lawyer at DLA Piper in Brussel . Thi is becom kind of a circus.The stanc taken by the regul  which have the power to investig and , in some case , to fine compani that have broken privaci rule in the region  repres a major setback for European and Unit State negoti who had spent year hammer out the deal .And the protest from the regul signal that they could open case and levi fine on compani that reli on move data such as employees financi inform or social media post across the Atlant .As part of their announc on Wednesday , European nation privaci regul said the data-transf agreement wa an improv on previou rule .

They also say that American safeguard over how nation intellig agenc gain access to person data go beyond what is avail in mani countri in the European Union .The U.S. ha a differ structur than Europ , but both system offer robust privaci protect ,  Penni Pritzker , the Unit State commerc secretari who led the American team in negoti to revamp the data-transf agreement , said in a recent interview .Despit Europe nation regul rais concern over Privaci Shield , legal expert and polici maker still expect the agreement to be approv by European countri by earli summer .That is becaus the European Commiss ha the sole power to agre to the new rule , and becaus some countri , particularli the like of Britain and Ireland , where mani American technolog compani have headquart , have given their support to the trans-Atlant deal .It remain unclear how the European Commiss will alter Privaci Shield to answer nation regulators concern , though it is unlik that European offici will reopen negoti with their American counterpart .But Europe privaci regul  which will soon gain the right to fine compani up to 4 percent of their global revenu if they are found to have broken local data protect law  may still not be satisfi with ani chang to the data-transf agreement , increas uncertainti over how some of the world largest compani will handl digit inform .No nation regul want to put compani in a legal limbo ,  said Alexand Whalen , a senior polici manag at Digit Europ , an industri bodi whose member includ Googl and Microsoft .

Wer come out of a recess , which realli drove home the point that you need a strong manufactur base to creat jobs.When Made in NYC wa conceiv in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attack , thi wa a strategi to both encourag consum to shop more local and to get compani to buy from each other to strengthen local suppli chain ,  Mr. Friedman said .Growth wa initi slow , until four or five year ago . Someth dramat chang ,  he said . I think there wa realli a shift in consum prefer . It coincid with the whole locavor movement.Seiz on thi trend , and with $ 750,000 from the New York Citi Council , Made in NYC introduc it recent campaign with Dream , Job and ____ ,  and , Made Here in NYC.Wer help busi learn how to market themselv a littl more , but also do a public brand campaign ,  said Melissa Mark-Viverito , the Citi Council speaker . Wer rais that level of conscious and awareness.Thi quest to revit urban manufactur is not limit to New York Citi .Found in 2011 , the Urban Manufactur Allianc is a grass-root effort to help small manufactur . Led by the Pratt Center and an allianc of manufactur in San Francisco call SFMade , it ha member in 115 citi , includ Cincinnati , Detroit and Seattl . Thi year it form a committe to focu on local market strategi , said Lee Wellington , the group found execut director .Within the econom develop movement , there isnt alway a recognit that brand is a viabl strategi ,  Ms. Wellington said . Urban manufactur are realiz that , along with issu like zone regul and land use rule , market play a role in advocaci  retain industri zone in gentrifi neighborhood , for instanc  as well as increas sale .That an import element to thi whole movement ,  Ms. Wellington said . It creat a stronger relationship between the consum market in these citi and the maker movement.Ms. Wellington predict that the New York Citi campaign would attract attent from other member .Wer see a lot of interest in how thi can be replic ,  she said .Sinc modern urban factori are more high-tech and nimbl than their predecessor , manufactur today can creat a wide array of product in smaller space , and Made in NYC want to commun that in it campaign .Our main object wa to highlight the divers of thing that are made here ,  said T. J. McCormick , partner and execut creativ director at Eyebal , a strateg design and brand firm that is work with Made in NYC .Antonio Reynoso , a citi councilman whose district includ the North Brooklyn Industri Busi Zone , ha support the Council involv in the campaign . About 40 percent of my district that I repres is manufactur ,  he said . We have chair maker . We have belt maker . We have food distributor and packagers.The challeng wa portray that divers in a cohes way . In the new ad , the blank repres the final word of Dream , Job and ____ is various fill in with exampl as divers as guitar and gourmet food .Similarli , there wa a deliber choic to use the word made in the ad instead of manufactured.There are a lot of associ with it  that it just old-school tool and heavi machineri and stuff , which is whi we ultim land on the word made ,  Mr. McCormick said . It soften it a littl bit , make it feel more broad.The campaign includ a social element , which use geographi to focu ad and incorpor a quiz about local made product , said Noreen OLoughlin , Made in NYC program director . The group is also invest in target digit advertis , creat by Eyebal , to increas it reach , especi among young adult .To reach New Yorker while they are commut or run errand , the campaign use billboard and advertis on kiosk and subway in place like Manhattan garment district and the Lower East Side , along the Long Island Expressway and in neighborhood in Brooklyn and Queen . We felt we need to be on the street and in front of peopl ,  Mr. McCormick said .Educ that consum base is , I think , what the Made in NYC campaign is all about , and so much of what wer tri to do with our entir member base across the countri ,  Ms. Wellington said . It commun the valu of manufacturing.', 'Everi modern presidenti elect is at least in part defin by the cool new media breakthrough of it moment . In 2000 , there wa email , and by golli wa that a big chang from the fax . The campaign could get their messag in front of print and cabl news report  who could still domin the campaign narr  at will , reduc what had been a 24-hour news cycl to an hourli one .The 2004 campaign wa the year of the Web log ,  or blog , when mainstream report and campaign offici began lose ani control they may have had over polit news . Anyon with a comput could weigh in with commentari , news and , often , sear critic of mainstream report and politician  Media Gatekeep be damn ! Then 2008 : Facebook made it that much easier for campaign to reach million of peopl directli , further reduc the influenc of newspap , magazin and televis journalist . In 2012 , Twitter shrank the polit news cycl to minut if not second , exponenti ad to the churn of campaign news .The question thi year ha been whether 2016 will be the Snapchat elect ,  a refer to the popular and new ( ish ) photo- and video-shar servic that alreadi ha some 100 million daili user and ha a campaign news team of season pro .There is some debat about Snapchat role thi year . It presenc in the media ecosystem is undeni : Snapchat say nearli twice as mani 18-to-24-year-old watch the first Republican debat on it app than saw it on televis . But it probabl still too earli in the campaign year to say how defin it will be .It not too earli , howev , to say that Snapchat is a fit symbol for 2016 , and a power one . It veri exist repres a shift in the way news and inform cours through our overserv bodi polit . And that could have an effect on the outcom of the campaign , if it isnt have one alreadi .For so long , media advanc affect the speed of news . But speed ha more or less top out with Twitter . What faster than second ? ( Pleas dont say we need to get it to nanosecond . ) Snapchat repres a chang to someth els : the longev of news , how durabl it keep in our brain cell and our server .Most of the stuff that is share through the Snapchat app  whether it a birds-ey video of a mischiev cat , a boister Trump ralli or a terrorist attack  goe away after 24 hour or much less , just disappear .That is the opposit of the approach taken by The New York Time and other tradit news organ that are report histori for the record . Snapchat is record the here and the now , play for today . Tomorrow will bring someth new that render today obsolet . It a digit Tibetan sand paint made in the imag of the millenni mind .Snapchat execut say they set up the app thi way becaus thi is what their ten of million of younger user want ; it how they live . That make sens , given the way their gener exist onlin , interfac with a constant stream of bit and byte . They cant possibl have enough bandwidth to process all the incom inform and still dwell on what alreadi wa , can they ? ( O.K. , probabl , but stick with me as I play thi through ; it lead somewher ) .The older gener are get there , too , as daili adult media consumpt ha expand beyond televis , radio and newspap to includ all the innov I mention abov : email , websit , Facebook , Twitter , text messag , Instagram , Periscop and now Snapchat .It wa into thi media hurrican that the presidenti campaign caravan drove thi year , and mani of it car were blown off the road .Experienc strategist and their candid , who could alway work through their elect plan method  promot their candidaci one foot in front of the other , adjust here and there for the unexpect  suddenli found that they couldnt oper the way they alway did .Marco Rubio campaign march into the elect season readi to fight the usual news-cycle-by-news-cycl skirmish . It wa surpris to learn that , lo and behold , There wa no news cycl  everyth wa one big fire hose ,  Alex Conant , a senior Rubio strategist , told me . New wa constantli break and at the end of the day hardli anyth matter . Thing would happen ; 24 hour later , everyon wa talk about someth else.Then there wa Jeb Bush , expect to press ahead by present what he saw as leading-edg polici propos that would set off a prolong back-and-forth . When Mr. Bush roll out a fairli sweep plan to upend the colleg loan system , the poor guy thought thi wa go to becom a big thing . Jeb would say to me in the car , Thi is radic stuff ,  Tim Miller , a senior aid in the Bush campaign , told me . It drew onli modest coverag and wa quickli buri by the latest bit from Donald Trump .Which bring me to the good news for presidenti candid . In thi hit refresh polit cultur , damag news doe not have to stick around for long , either . The next develop , good or bad , replac it almost immedi . Thi is arguabl the best time in modern histori to have a scandal . ( Note to ethic compromis pol : If you have an embarrass piec of video that is bound to get out , give it exclus to Snapchat , then destroy it . ) At the veri least , it is the best time to be Mr. Trump .Ask Mr. Miller . He is now work for one of the most aggress Republican anti-Trump group , Our Principl PAC . Mr. Miller know hi way around a pair of brass knuckl , campaign-styl . But , onc again , the old combin  dump damag opposit research ,  watch em drown in it  are prove far less potent than they were .Mr. Miller point to a recent episod in which Mr. Trump said a protest at a ralli had ti to ISI ,  after that protest charg the stage . No such tie exist . He say ISI is attack me ; thi wa debunk in eight minut by Twitter ,  Mr. Miller said . Cabl talk about it for three hour and it went away.Hillari Clinton said that she wa under sniper fire in Bosnia  she wasnt  and that ha stuck with her for 20 year ,  Mr. Miller said .Mr. Trump ha master thi era of short attent span in polit by realiz that if your the one regularli feed the stream , you can forev move past your latest troubl , and hasten the mass amnesia .It wa with thi in mind that The Washington Post ran an editori late last week remind it reader of some of Mr. Trump more outlandish statement and polici posit on the eve of what a senior aid describ as a come person chang by Mr. Trump , to one more befit a presid .The Post urg it reader to remember more than two dozen item from Mr. Trump record , includ that he promis to round up 11 million undocu immigr and deport them ,  and li about Presid Obama birth certificate.Fred Hiatt , The Post editori page editor , told me in an email that given the constantli churn news cycl ,  Mr. Trump trail of incendiari statement and propos may seem like news from anoth era. He ad , It import that they not be forgotten.When I ran all of thi by the good peopl at Snapchat they bristl at my choic of symbol , understand . Peter Hambi , Snapchat head of news , said Snapchat should not be an emblem for a lack of attent span in our politics.With a uniqu line to younger voter , Snapchat present substant stori on issu like the elect and the Flint water crisi in way they can relat to , Mr. Hambi said . Snapchat report are ephemer , he said , becaus it about be in the moment with thi young audienc , be in the flow of their live .Of cours , that where that audienc live , in the moment . Still , as the media habit of the young drive everybodi else , Im remind of that old saw about those who forget histori . Now , what wa I say ?', 'SAN FRANCISCO  Mark Zuckerberg , Facebook co-found and chief execut , is clear about hi vision for hi compani : He want to tripl the size of hi social network , which now ha 1.6 billion member .But to reach that new audienc , he ha to find a way to chang telecommun network to make connect to the Internet more afford , sinc mani of those would-b Facebook user live in develop countri .That could be bad news for the compani that make equip for those network , whether they are Silicon Valley giant like Cisco System or littl widget maker that produc the part to tie differ piec of the network togeth .There is definit go to be some pressur , some consolidation for mani tech equip supplier , said Akshay Sharma , research director at the technolog advisori firm Gartner . If your in hardwar , your go to reduc head count from thousand to mayb 10 peopl , a hundr at most.No doubt , Mr. Zuckerberg grand  some would say grandios  vision could take year to realiz . But if he manag to make the way peopl connect to the Internet more afford , it would be just the latest instanc of how the compani ha quietli upend the tradit econom of the technolog industri .Facebook ha chang the way peopl interact with their friend on the Internet . But less understood outsid tech circl is how the social network ha come to be perhap the most aggress exampl of a grow number of compani that are unwil to pay top dollar for product made by tradit technolog supplier .Mr. Zuckerberg ha embrac so-cal open-sourc concept , which have help him play catch-up with the giant comput network of compani like Amazon and Googl .Open sourc typic refer to freeli share code or even develop plan that compani and peopl collect creat at a fraction of the price of tradit tech product . Bit of open-sourc technolog can be found in all sort of thing , includ Google Android oper system and web browser .Compani like Facebook often contribut to open-sourc project sinc they dont make money sell product  instead , they have to buy product that help them offer their servic . Keep tech cost down help the bottom line .Thi sort of enlighten self-interest sound simpl , but it impact ha been dramat . In 2000 , for exampl , Sun Microsystem wa worth $ 110 billion thank to demand for it comput server and workstat . A decad later the compani wa sold for $ 7.4 billion . Sun fell to cheaper competit from Linux , the popular open-sourc code that now run mani of Facebook server .When Facebook reveal the financi result for it most recent quarter on Wednesday , investor will no doubt scrutin how much the compani is spend , particularli sinc Mr. Zuckerberg ha promis to invest more money in search for new user . One big key to keep those cost down ha been open-sourc technolog .Increasingli , Facebook doe it own work on plan the comput hardwar and softwar that it use to deliv it servic . It even releas as open sourc the design of the rack where it server oper .It should not be surpris , then , that Mr. Zuckerberg is reli on open sourc to reduc the price of build and run the world telecommun network , a busi estim to be worth about $ 150 billion a year .Our rule is 10 time faster or 10 time cheaper or both ,  said Jay Parikh , Facebook vice presid for engin . We want to get a full Facebook experi to everi end user , whether that is video , or eventu virtual reality.Establish telecommun compani are move fast to adjust . Nokia , the Finnish compani , join Facebook in Februari at the announc of the Telecom Infra Project , or TIP , a Facebook-l group that is tri to reduc telecom cost . Cisco System intend to start donat softwar to TIP , hope to profit from heavi overal usag on the world big telecom system .There is a new forc in the system ,  said Dave Ward , Cisco chief architect . Wed rather be on the train than in front of it.In the futur , Mr. Zuckerberg imagin that a physic thing , like a TV , will just be a $ 1 app insid virtual realiti on Facebook , he recent told a confer of softwar develop build app for Facebook . But that may be 10 year off , by Mr. Zuckerberg own admiss . Peopl who do not work at Facebook might say it is a fantasi .Facebook even appear will to turn the price-crush model on itself . To get virtual realiti to everi place in the world , Facebook Oculu VR headset , current $ 600 , may have to cost $ 5 , said Mike Schroepfer , the company chief technolog offic .Is that anoth fantasi ? For Facebook , get those cost down could mean control the next big commun platform , sinc Mr. Zuckerberg believ virtual realiti may eventu supplant smartphon as a primari connect to the onlin world .The world is make enough phone . It better for the world if there are fewer devic ,  Mr. Schroepfer said . It not total obviou how all thi shake out  whether well have lot of consum product , or it all disappear into a coupl of VR headsets.How much profit thi new audienc will yield Facebook is an open question . But Facebook would rather control a crucial technolog than have to build on top of anoth company product , as it ha had to do with PC and smartphon .It more opportun to show ad ,  said Danni Sullivan , founder of the technolog websit Search Engin Land , who is a close watcher of the industri . It more opportun to gather data on what we do or who we are connect with . It more opportun to build a new platform where Facebook serv as the broker of connectivity.At the same Facebook developers confer there were talk on the latest open-sourc effort , includ an urban wireless network that check it perform 125,000 time a second , and a long-rang wireless system that Facebook say can send a gigabit of data a second , about 10 time the rate of today good-perform network and enough for virtual realiti .Both technolog , Mr. Parikh said , will be test thi year , with an eye to releas them as open-sourc project . Well be into all thi stuff ,  he said . Facebook doe not want to own or sell the gear , he ad , but plan to work with hundreds of local phone compani worldwid on cheaper high-spe connect .Facebook isnt alon in tackl the econom of connect to the Internet . Googl is aim it Fiber servic at radic cut price compar with what cabl compani charg . Insid Amazon cloud comput busi is a compani call Twilio , which suppli inexpens phone and video servic .But other dismiss some of Facebook effort as hype . We are connect 700 million to 1.5 billion peopl a year via smartphon and tablet ,  said Ulf Ewaldsson , chief technic offic at Ericsson , one of the world largest maker of telecommun hardwar .They say they can do a 90 percent cost reduct , but that is from phone bill for high-cost custom ,  he said . Poor peopl need to be cover , and the industri is work on that.', 'Thi is what to expect from the week ahead .OIL INDUSTRiThi week is like to produc evid of the impact fall oil price are have on oil-produc countri and busi .

Emili Steel', 'It all up to Elizabeth Holm .Therano , a blood-test lab start and led by Ms. Holm that promis to revolution the industri , is now under crimin investig and face increas skeptic about whether it core technolog work . Sever feder agenc are look into the company oper . Ms. Holm herself may have to answer to feder regul about what she told investor .Just last year , Therano wa a Silicon Valley favorit with a $ 9 billion valuat . Now , depend on the outcom of the investig , includ the threat of crippl sanction by the Center for Medicar and Medicaid Servic , the compani could be forc out of busi and Ms. Holm could lose her posit as chief execut .The troubl have led to a cascad of question about what chang Therano might make to rebuild it reput and busi prospect . Some have even said that Ms. Holm should step asid .After more than six month of intens question , though , chang have been limit . And whatev futur move the compani make are up to Ms. Holm . She  not the investor , and not even the board  control the switch .Ms. Holm , a 32-year-old Stanford Univers dropout , own a major interest in Therano , a privat held compani she found in 2003 . She is also the company chairwoman and chief execut . What she want done at her compani , she can demand .Ms. Holm declin to be interview . But in an extend interview , David Boi , a heavyweight lawyer who is one of three outsid director on the Therano board , hint that some manag chang may be come soon .The board is right now in the process , and Elizabeth Holm is in the process , of ad signific talent to the compani ,  he said .But an advis to the compani , Richard Kovacevich , a former chief execut at Well Fargo , acknowledg the limit role play by anyon other than Ms. Holm . She doesnt have to answer anyth she doesnt want to ,  he said .The situat at Therano offer a stark remind of the peril of invest in Silicon Valley , where it is common for founder to control a compani , leav board with littl real power , includ over who should be chief execut .The exampl are legion , includ huge success stori like Googl and Facebook . The upsid for ventur capitalist is that bet on an individu and get in earli can lead to rich . But if troubl brew , it is nearli imposs for a board or anyon but the founder to make ani chang  a risk that , for now at least , investor remain will to make .For everi Therano , there a Facebook ,  said Bryan Robert , a partner at Venrock , a lead ventur capit firm .Even in a case like Zenefit , where it founder , Parker Conrad , step down as chief execut in Februari after regulatori problem emerg , the decis to resign wa ultim hi .Theranos board , which in it earli year includ some of it larg investor , wa later compos of an array of diplomat , militari and polit leader , includ former Secretari of State Georg Shultz and Henri Kissing and former Senat Bill Frist . Last year , the compani divid the director into advis and an actual govern board , which includ Mr. Boi , whose law firm repres Therano .While critic have point to the board lack of industri expertis and the advanc age of some advis , Mr. Boi defend it as extraordinarili qualified.But legal expert say that while the director are respons for repres the interest of all investor , Ms. Holm doe not have to listen . A founder with control interest can replac the board , so director are ultim left with the choic of be fire or resign if they strongli disagre with the execut .Supervot share , anoth common practic among start-up , grant founder like Ms. Holm even more power .Your practic a paper tiger and have fiduciari respons ,  said Charl Elson , a corpor govern expert at the Univers of Delawar .Mr. Boi say Ms. Holm ha the board back . I think the board ha complet confid in Elizabeth Holm as a founder of the compani , as a scientist and as an administr ,  he said .The board is repres by an independ law firm , Mr. Boi said , which is answer queri from the Unit State attorney offic in San Francisco and the Secur and Exchang Commiss , as well as conduct an independ investig into whether Therano made proper disclosur to investor . No formal accus have been made .While Therano is privat held , it investor still have protect , said Joseph Grundfest , a law professor at Stanford . The feder secur law have veri strict anti-fraud provis , and they appli to sophist investor , not just unsophist ones.But Mr. Kovacevich , who is also an investor , emphas that Therano wa not a publicli held compani with the same respons and that the sharehold understood thi .Not onli is thi a privat compani , but it ha also been state to the world , to the board and stockhold , that she ha no intent of ever go public ,  he said of Ms. Holm . The intent , and a strong intent , is that thi compani is go to be privat forever.The Medicar investig is the most press threat , and Mr. Boi is larg mum about what Therano is plan and how the board is react . Therano ha been the subject of scath coverag in The Wall Street Journal , which ha relentlessli question the reliabl and safeti of it blood test , and it is under intens regulatori scrutini . The exact focu of what need to be done keep chang ,  Mr. Boi said .Medicar , concern about the company California oper , ha said Therano could face sever sanction if the compani doe not adequ address the defici uncov last year . Theranos California lab certif could be revok , and Ms. Holm and the company chief oper offic could be bar from the industri for two year .The lab and it procedur have been overhaul , Mr. Boi said . Ms. Holm ha hire new manag to run the lab , and becaus the peopl who ran it previous did not report directli to her , he said he hope the agenc would not take punit action against her . The company other lab , in Arizona , which perform more tradit test , continu to draw custom , he note .But Therano still face extraordinari skeptic about whether it main technolog work , especi given it histori of secret , and Mr. Boi said Therano wa take step to address the doubt . He point to plan to final publish it result in peer-review journal and the addit of some well-respect individu to it scientif advisori board . Wev got to reveal much more about the proprietari technolog than is desir ,  given the risk of companies and countries copi what Therano doe , Mr. Boi said .The company intellectu properti is essenti it main asset , and if the technolog work , some observ say , the compani could remain a viabl busi . I dont think theyr beyond salvag , beyond redempt ,  said Lakshman Ramamurthi , an industri consult with extens regulatori experi .But while he did not rule out a sale , Mr. Boi dismiss the idea of hand Therano over to the highest bidder . Thi technolog is not go to be sold to somebodi who want to just make more profit from it and charg what is charg today ,  he said .And , as Mr. Kovacevich emphas , Ms. Holm will ultim determin what happen next .

Miss a major payment on such debt would not onli set off a wave of creditor lawsuit , but it could also cast a shadow over America $ 3.7 trillion municip bond market , for decad an essenti sourc of financ for public work .Thi wa a pain decis ,  the governor said in a televis speech on Sunday , in which he struck a nationalist tone and said he had to invok hi emerg power under Puerto Rican law becaus help from Washington wa not forthcom .We would have prefer to have had a legal framework to restructur our debt in an orderli manner ,  he said .Feder law bar Puerto Rico from restructur under Chapter 9 , the part of the bankruptci code that insolv citi and other local govern can use . Lawmak in the Hous of Repres , under the direct of Speaker Paul D.

In hi speech he blame unnam oppon of the peopl of Puerto Rico ,  who , he said , have unleash a brutal campaign of racial discrimin and lie against us ,  convinc some member of Congress that Puerto Rico need auster rather than debt relief .Puerto Rico need Speaker Paul Ryan to exercis hi leadership and honor hi word ,  he said . We cant wait longer . We need thi restructur mechan now.The governor also express skeptic about a core principl of the rescu legisl : that to get extraordinari power to reduc debt , Puerto Rico must first come under feder oversight .

The hedg fund ask the feder court in San Juan to freez the bank asset , other than those paid out to support the basic safeti and well-b of the island resid .A few day later , Puerto Rico legislatur gave the governor the power to do much the same thing : to halt debt payment , to save cash for essenti public servic .What we will never do is put the live and safeti of our peopl in danger ,  said Mr. Garca Padilla in hi televis speech .

They were written for and by gadget fan , with an obsess focu on televis , game consol and , most of all , cellphon .As smartphon becam ubiquit , howev , their focu broaden . Tech public becam cultur public , and mani cultur site incorpor write about technolog . While both Engadget and Gizmodo remain , they are far differ than they were just a few year ago .Circuit Breaker will be edit by Paul Miller , a former employe of The Verg who is return to the compani . Mr. Miller said the new page would reach for a core audience of hard-cor gadget fan . The Verg offer some popular gadget coverag , but Mr. Miller said mani of those gadget fan feel neglect when wer talk about Netflix and technology role in the broader cultur .The page will also steer clear of cover the busi of tech , leav industri stori to The Verg or ReCod , the tech news site found by Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg that Vox Media acquir last year . ( Some articl and review from The Verg , where Mr. Mossberg publish a column , will appear on Circuit Breaker . )Instead , Mr. Miller said , he plan to focu on physic product that have yet to matur , or might never . He includ in thi group virtual realiti headset , drone , home autom gear , hoverboard and offbeat project .Circuit Breaker state mission is an acknowledg of just how power the smartphon ha becom , includ for public .

They were the million obsess with their phone ; next came the billion obsess less with the devic than with what wa on them . Now , thi chang ha becom imposs for media execut to ignor .We start out , a few year ago , build media brand on websit , becaus that where we thought the growth wa , and we were right about that ,  said Jim Bankoff , Vox Media chief execut . Eventu , he said , peopl start concentr around a few specif apps  Facebook , Twitter , Snapchat , Instagram and YouTub . We invest base on where we see potential.If Circuit Breaker is an ode to a simpler time in consum technolog , it also offer a clear audienc to advertis : peopl who are explicitli interest in buy thing .It a high-demand categori ,  Mr. Bankoff said .Vox Media will not be the first major media compani to tailor a public to a social platform . Vox , the polit site , alongsid 19 other publish , oper a channel on Snapchat , with which it share ad revenu . BuzzFe ha invest in Facebook-centr brand , and countless news site have dabbl with Instagram account and YouTub channel .But media compani are still chart their cours care . Advertis arrang with platform are in flux , and major tech compani , which oper at a differ scale than most public , make for intimid  and unpredict  negoti .Circuit Breaker will also exist , in blog form , in a section on The Verge websit . But the primari focu of the editor is on Facebook . The page will be at facebook.com/circuitbreak , and visitor will find a dens feed of video and news updat .The page , Mr. Patel said , will also broadcast a lot of live video on Facebook , someth the social network ha push hard in recent month . It will use Facebook Instant Articl , which are host directli on the servic , negat the need for link to an extern websit .The editor said they do not expect peopl to frequent check Circuit Breaker Facebook page for updat . Instead , reader will experi the site primarili through their Facebook news feed , where Circuit Breaker video , post and broadcast will appear alongsid updat from friend , famili and the countless other organ vy for attent on the platform .Wer go to be play the News Feed game like everyon els ,  said Helen Havlak , who overse social media distribut for The Verg and will work on the new site .

There are also the dog owner who can rest easi know that hire dog walker are do their job , and that the dog are do their busi .And then , there is the comfort of track your pizza deliveri .When Lora Mastrang order one from Pizza Hut everi other week , she doe not just wait for it . She stalk it .The moment her order leav the nearest Pizza Hut , about 30 minut from her home in Plano , Tex. , the restaur send Ms. Mastrang an alert on her smartphon with a link to a map show an imag of a pizza deliveri car drive toward her hous . Sinc she know her driver locat , she know precis when to scoop her two small dog up and sequest them in a back room to keep them from yap at the driver .Mi husband and I absolut love it ,  said Ms. Mastrang , who work in sale for Nordstrom . Wer walk out the door when he pull up.Peopl were amaz six year ago when the ride-hail servic Uber let them track the locat of their driver on a real-tim map as they wait for a ride , rather than accept the vagu assur of taxi dispatch . Other tech start-up follow with map to pinpoint the locat of all sort of thing , from shoe to food and the dog walker .And new servic from Comcast and Time Warner Cabl allow custom to see the exact locat of the cabl repairman on the way to the hous .The question , of cours , is whether map offer a bit more inform but do littl to improv underli problem . Cabl compani , for instanc , suffer from some of the lowest custom satisfact level of ani busi . Know exactli where your cabl guy is doe littl to address complaint about escal price .Im not sure that the root of the problem ,  said Franc X. Frei , a professor of servic manag at Harvard Busi School and author of Uncommon Servic ,  a book about custom servic .So doe track your pizza on a map just make you feel better ?It pure psycholog effect ,  said Nichola Goubert , head of project manag at Here , a digit map compani that provid locat data to Amazon and other busi . Your pizza is not go to come ani sooner . But it moving.Soon UP , the world largest packag deliveri compani , may also begin show custom exactli where their stuff is . UP is explor give locat map of it familiar brown truck to custom and could begin a trial of the servic within a few month , accord to a person brief on the plan who ask for anonym becaus it is still privat .Execut at big , establish compani conced that their move are inspir by on-demand busi like Uber , which have chang what custom expect from all kind of servic .It bring that visibl and transpar that theyr start to come to expect with the Uber and Lyft ,  said Baron Concor , global chief digit offic for Pizza Hut , which began share the locat of deliveri driver with custom in some market about six month ago . There a new bar for experi when it come to deliveri and transport that everyon is go to have to meet.The technolog behind most of thi is not terribl complic . The map typic reli on the GP locat provid by , say , a pizza deliveri driver smartphon and triangul that with Wi-Fi and cellphon tower signal to pinpoint a locat . Compani like Appl , too , have made helicopt parent easier by let mother and father track the locat of children through their smartphon .In mani case , compani that provid custom with live track inform have a practic motiv . The servic is intend to elimin situat when someon miss a knock on the door by step into the shower or backyard . A miss deliveri or servic call is a logist headach compani want to avoid .If they have to come back , they lose money ,  said Bryan Trussel , chief execut of Glymps , a location-track start-up in Seattl that is work with compani like Pizza Hut , Comcast and Time Warner .Some compani are go to bizarr length to provid greater transpar to custom through map . Last year , Wag , a start-up in Lo Angel , introduc the mobil app that includ a live map that show the pet owner the rout of the Wag walker and pooch .Joshua Viner , chief execut of Wag , said the map allow pet owner to verifi that their dog is get the amount of exercis the owner is pay for .There no way to cheat the system ,  said Julien LoPresti , who work in sale and oper for a technolog compani in New York and ha use Wag to find walker for Reptar , hi Labrador mix . It give you extra confidence.In the next month , Wag will go even further by allow walker to commemor where pet reliev themselv by tap the screen on their smartphon . Correspond emoji will materi on the app of pet owner .It all real time  it almost like your part of the experi ,  Mr. Viner said .Comcast wa after a differ experi when it began let custom track the locat of technician last year , part of a much broader initi to improv custom satisfact .The compani use to have four-hour appoint window when technician could arriv at customers home , which confin the custom there for a good chunk of the day . Now Comcast ha cut the appoint window to two hour .The overal premis is we should alway be respect customers time ,  said Charli Herrin , execut vice presid of custom experi at Comcast .About 30 minut befor the two-hour window , Comcast send the custom a notif through the Comcast mobil app give a narrow , half-hour window when the technician expect to arriv . About 15 minut befor the technician pull up at the home , Comcast send a link to a map that show the vehicl en rout .Dr. Frei , the Harvard Busi School professor , said custom would be happier if Comcast were more precis with it appoint estim from the start .What Id like them to do is say , We will be there at 3 p.m. ,  and then what Id like to have happen is theyr there at 3 p.m. ,  she said .

But to Matthew Kaminski , Politico Europe execut editor , it wa an event that lent itself natur to Politico brand of swift , flood-the-zon news coverag .We have the biggest newsroom in thi town ,  Mr. Kaminski said of the more than 40 journalist now under hi command , and thi wa a hit on our community.Befor the bomb , sharp coverag in Politico had alreadi brand Belgium a fail state , after it wa reveal that last November terrorist attack on Pari had also been organ in a neglect neighborhood of central Brussel . The sustain scrutini in Politico , address to an intern , English-speak audienc , rankl mani in Belgium famous parochi establish  as the more deferenti member of the country French- and Dutch-languag media look on . Just three day befor the Brussel attack , a spokesman for the prime minist dismiss Politico analysi on Twitter as bias as always.We were on site , push that button everi day ,  said Ryan Heath , a senior correspond who write Politico wide read Brussel Playbook newslett .It had a multipli effect ,  Mr. Heath said , and that did not go down well.The Brussel attack punctuat what had alreadi been an unusu newsi first year for Politico European ventur , which wa start last April in partnership with the German publish group Axel Springer . In addit to terror and secur , subject like the migrat crisi , the ongo war in Ukrain , grind debt talk with Greec and the prospect of a British exit from the 28-member European Union not onli kept the Contin in the headlin but also serv to remind European  and the rest of the world  of the import of the often arcan polici debat take place in Brussel .Much like the origin Politico , which wa found in 2007 , it European incarn cover it beat like a villag paper , har the immediaci of the Internet to deliv break news at a brisk tempo to a core readership of polit and civic insid . It granular coverag of everyth from ministeri summit meet to regulatori committe hear is leaven with tidbit from errant email and restaur recommend , as well as reveal anecdot about the biggest power broker in Brussel .We dont want to just write about polit , but about whi these differ actor are do the thing they do ,  said Carri Budoff Brown , a former White Hous report for Politico who is now the manag editor in Brussel .As a digital-first news outlet , Politico Europ use it websit as a shop window . Politico.eu offer a mix of free news and analysi as well as a menu of premium Politico Pro subscript channel focus on topic such as energi , health care and technolog polici . It is a hybrid of free and for-pay offer that ha been copi from Politico success American oper , said Shhrazad Semsar-d Boissson , the manag director in Brussel . So far , she said , it ha exceed it shareholders expect both for audienc and revenu .We didnt realli know how mani reader insid the Brussel bubble there would be ,  said Ms. Semsar-d Boissson , the former publish of European Voic , a narrowli focus , policy-driven weekli that she sold in 2014 to Axel Springer and that wa supplant by Politico Europ .Politico Europ claim an audienc of one million to 1.5 million uniqu monthli visitor to it free websit , 30,000 reader of it weekli print newspap and about 200 institut subscrib to it Pro product , whose potenti user base number in the ten of thousand ,  Ms. Semsar-d Boissson said .Compar with other English-languag public with a reput for in-depth , if not exclus , coverag of the European Union  and that cater to a global audienc  Politico ha a modest reach , especi rel to the size of it newsroom . The Financi Time , with a staff of five in Brussel , claim to reach 2.1 million reader everi day in print and onlin , of whom close to 800,000 are pay subscrib .Politico Europ say it is the qualiti , not the size , of the readership that matter most . About 20 percent of it reader live and work in Belgium , it largest European market , follow by about 11 percent in Britain and 9 percent in Germani .We produc a kind of news for insid that give them the juic that they can use ,  said Mr. Kaminski , who came to Politico from The Wall Street Journal , where he work for more than a decad in Pari and Brussel .Reader of Politico special Pro servic includ offici and staff from all the major branch of the European Union , as well as senior member of govern , corpor and consult .

It ha realli becom the thing that start the daili convers here.It ha also transform Mr. Heath , an Australian who is a former spokesman and speechwrit for the European Commiss , into Politico de facto public face and a minor celebr in Brussel .It mean your spin a lot of plate ,  Mr. Heath said one recent morn as he race from the newsroom to deliv a live updat for CNN on the bomb investig .But beyond the gener and widespread prais for Playbook , Politico European recept ha been mix . It zest for short-shelf-lif scoop and it frequent focu on person have led some to dismiss it coverag as increment and shallow , with littl relev to reader outsid Brussel .Some of the coverag is a bit superfici and doesnt alway get to the heart of the matter ,  said Jon Worth , a commun consult in Berlin and longtim blogger about European affair .Jean-Claud Juncker , the presid of the European Commiss , for exampl , wa upset by a Politico articl last year about hi battl with kidney stone , which he later derid as peep-show journalism.Jean Quatrem , who cover European polit for the French daili Librat , said in an email , Politico is fire on all cylind to get peopl talk about them , and they are succeeding. But , he ad , it too sensationalist , too into hype up small stories.Tara Palmeri , a former writer for The New York Post gossip column , Page Six , who now cover the European Commiss for Politico , wa quick to shrug off such critic .We are make them famou . Wer make them relev , even when we are be critic ,  Ms. Palmeri said of the leader she cover . We are tell the stori that make them human and even sort of interesting.Mr. Kaminski said Politico recogn the need to attract new European reader beyond Brussel and to that end wa alreadi recruit staff to reinforc the small bureau it ha in London , Pari and Berlin .

It a work in progress.', 'HONG KONG  The Unit Steelwork union ha suspend indefinit an unusu effort to push the Unit State govern to restrict all aluminum import after the campaign ran into opposit from aluminum compani , the Canadian govern and even Canadian member of the union .The union on Friday withdrew it petit to an American trade panel , which wa file the preced Monday , after an aluminum industri group agre to work with the union to address it main concern : Chines aluminum product overcapac and export . The Aluminum Associ share mani of the concern express by the Unit Steelwork regard Chines aluminum overproduct ,  the group said in a statement . Overcapac must be address to maintain a vibrant and healthi North American aluminum industry.The statement provid no specif , say onli that , The industri support ongo effort by the U.S. and Chines govern to address thi critic issue.China aluminum export have surg as the country economi slow . Those export have displac Canadian export in some intern market , trigger an increas in Canadian shipment to the Unit State , where they now account for two-third of all American import of raw aluminum .At the same time , American compani includ Alcoa have also been expand in countri includ Canada , Iceland and Saudi Arabia while close less effici oper in the Unit State .The union tri to address the issu by invok Section 201 of the 1974 Trade Act  an obscur trade law not employ sinc 2001 , when Presid Georg W. Bush use it to restrict steel import . That nearli set off a trade war with the European Union . In a Section 201 case , American industri or union face seriou injuri from import may seek broad tariff on import from around the world rather than from a particular countri .The union petit trigger a strong reaction from govern offici and worker in Canada , especi in the provinc of Quebec . That wa awkward for the Unit Steelwork , which repres worker across North America .Although it withdrew the petit , the union said on Friday : We believ the Section 201 case would have result in immedi price increas that would have help to maintain domest product and employ as well as ensur that produc in the Unit State and Canada would be abl to obtain a fairer price for their products.Section 201 case are handl initi by the Unit State Intern Trade Commiss , a bipartisan panel of trade expert in Washington . But the final decis is made by the presid , who decid whether to follow recommend from the commiss . Case that involv substanti import from Canada or Mexico are sometim slightli harder for American industri and union to win becaus they are cover by the North American Free Trade Agreement .', 'Onlin media compani are , onc again , brace for chang . Now , the prospect face them is audienc that dont just start on social media platform  they never have to leav them .Facebook now host articl creat by outsid publish , as well as video and live broadcast . Snapchat , with it Discov product , ha creat a sort of onlin media in miniatur , with TV , newspap and magazin compani angl to have a channel on the platform . And , of cours , media compani publish constantli to Instagram and Twitter , amass giant audienc .To publish , the rise of platform ha been disori at best , as it threaten mani of their busi model . To Andrei Hagiu , a 38-year-old associ professor at Harvard Busi School , the chang ha follow a familiar pattern . Mr. Hagiu is an economist who studi platform and multisid marketplac  like eBay and Amazon or Airbnb and Uber  that have , in similar way , transform , destroy or expand industri . ( Multisid marketplac are busi that enabl interact between differ type of custom . A credit card processor connect custom with merchant and collect fee ; Airbnb connect renter with properti owner and doe the same . ) In 2006 , with David S. Evan and Richard Schmalense , he wrote Invis Engin : How Softwar Platform Drive Innov and Transform Industri ,  a book on the subject .Mr. Hagiu spoke at length with The New York Time about what chang when a platform come to town , and what it might mean for onlin media . The interview wa condens and edit for clariti .Would you defin a public as a multisid marketplac ?Ye  we can say it a two-sid platform , if we count the two side as be the reader on one side and the advertis on the other . Now , there a separ question  we can talk about the third side ,  which would be the writer .Someth like a Tumblr or Medium  a place where peopl can just post ?Ye , where there clearli a direct interact , and there a lot more control by the two side  it truli on the platform , not a lot of control exert by the public as an aggreg .How would you then describ , in similar term , what a compani like Facebook is  or a compani like Snapchat ?Facebook , I alway say it at least a four-sid platform . They have user , they have advertis , they have third-parti applic develop , and then final they have websit that use the Facebook Connect system  which is to say that you can log in with your Facebook credenti .Where doe a compani that is produc profession video or journal for Facebook  publish those directli on Facebook and get some kind of revenu  fit in ?So , basic theyr ad one extra side , which we can call premium content publish ,  broadli . It make sens , and it veri similar to the transform that YouTub ha gone through . They went from have pretti much one side  when they start off , for the first few year , everyon wa a user . As a user you could watch video or post video . But everyon wa the same . Sometim I watch , sometim I post ; some peopl just watch , some peopl just post . But they are all the same user . Now theyv becom a lot more sophist , with advertis and revenu share , and with profession video produc .If a publication-styl busi becom a particip in a marketplac like Facebook , what ha chang for it ?Thi ha been an ongo concern . Let say your an establish compani , and now there a multisid platform in your busi , what happen ? And say you have to play on that multisid platform , becaus theyr big and everyon els is play , so you need to get on top of it . The concern is alway commodit . I think partli it true  what a platform doe , to some degre , is introduc a lowest common denomin . In particular , they make the substitut , or the switch cost , between the differ player a lot lower . I think that undeni . It much easier to switch between , say , The New York Time and The Wall Street Journal as a user , and as an advertis by the way , if those are on top of Facebook .One exampl that youv publish on befor is Toy R Us . I know thi will sound ridicul to some peopl in the publish industri , to compar a toy retailer relationship with Amazon to a publication relationship with a social platform . But mayb it shouldnt ?When Amazon emerg as the pre-emin e-commerc platform , a lot of big compani said , we need to find a way to play with them  it seem like there a lot of e-commerc go on there , and we cant ignor it , so we need to do someth . Toy R Us struck a deal that turn out later to be not veri advantag . Initi , it wa a good deal for Toy R Us , and it gave them access to Amazon custom . But afterward what happen wa Amazon found way to take advantag of Toy R Us , use the relationship , and it presenc on their platform , to start a toy categori on Amazon , to figur out how to sell toy on Amazon , and then to invit a lot of compet compani on the same platform to compet with Toy R Us , which made it a lot less attract for them to be there .Essenti , they overlook the possibl that Amazon would just use them as a way to start a categori of toy  they somehow assum it would be exclus , without put it in the contract . And , obvious , if Im a platform , of cours I dont want to be exclus with anyon , right ? I mean , that the point of a platform . I want to have as much competit between whatev particip as possibl .So if we grant some sort of comparison between a publish partner relationship with a larg distribut platform and a retailer relationship with Amazon , that might sound alarm ?So , with Amazon , just to make the comparison veri clear  in the case of Amazon with Toy R Us , the first thing that happen that wa bad for Toy R Us wasnt that Amazon start sell it own toy in their own name , it wa that they invit third-parti smaller seller of toy to compet with Toy R Us on Amazon platform . And that competit is veri fierc . In the case of Snapchat , what your describ is pretti much the same thing  they may have tri , and realiz produc high-qual and engag content is not veri easi , and they probabl said , you know , we dont realli have to . Becaus we have all these user , and if we get good at aggreg that , or invit other third-parti content publish , that work just as well .How do pre-exist compani typic make the transit from be an independ particip in a particular categori to be , basic , a platform constitu ? That a broad question , but  is there an industri that might have use parallel to the media industri with someth like a major social platform ?I dont think it true that transit from independ to life on a platform necessarili ha to make thing wors . One thing that I think a lot about  in convers with ventur capitalist and other  is the notion that platform or marketplac inher commodit . I think more like what happen is the follow : I think platform , or marketplac , make it a lot easier for , say , the content provid or app develop that are veri , veri good to rise to the top , and pretti much commodit everyon els . So if your averag , it definit go to be veri bad . Life is go to be wors on a platform , becaus your expos to more competit . If your veri good , life on a platform is a lot better .Among the luxuri that you have as a media compani , when you have your coher audienc , is that you get to sort of self-defin a littl bit . A publish might hear you say , The best rise to the top ,  or , It good to be one of the best on a platform ,  and say , great , that us ! But I wonder if that fail to account for the redefinit of what your compani doe on a platform .It a littl bit like , if you ask driver how they rate their drive abil , you know , 80 percent say theyr abov averag . The import qualifi to what I said earlier , about how the best rise to the top , is that , inher , the platform forc a lot more special than befor . Previous , in the independ world , player were abl to afford to be a littl bit broader . I think the problem is , now , you realli have to think veri deepli , a lot more care  what , exactli , are the one or two thing wer realli good at , and focu on those . So there go to be a lot of forc special , becaus on a platform , competit will be vertic by vertic .In a case like Facebook , the content wa larg there befor  in the form of link .It make perfect sens , right , to bring more of that content insid , becaus they can increas engag .Thing load faster , it a better experi , and post and video are creat with Facebook in mind , which mean they might feel better insid the platform .Ye , and they want to do as much as possibl  ideal , for them , they want to get as much content as they can to increas readership . There probabl a function between the well-b of the platform and the qualiti of the content that they have .It seem like there a great deal in common across the social platform , in term of how theyr make money  Ill includ Snapchat , Facebook , Twitter and Instagram as exampl  sinc theyr mostli advertising-support . If they continu to becom more domin , it seem like these similar could express themselv in a more direct sort of competit , perhap for partner . Which celebr choos which ; which compani work on which .Thi is harder  for video game , right now , the larg game develop are nonexclus . They use to be more exclus , and I think thi ha decreas over time  it becom veri hard to convinc , say , Electron Art to give up the Xbox One market to work with the PlayStat . So that ha definit play against the platform . Game platform alway tri to buy or produc their own game for differenti , but it veri hard .A differ exampl , the other way , is onlin video  Netflix and Amazon . The problem there is veri similar . Everyon ha , basic , the same movi by now . So thi ha push Netflix and Amazon to start produc their own content . If Im one of the origin provid  studio , I guess  then Im not happi , becaus now you have thi high-qual product from Netflix and Amazon , who are steal viewer from you .You take thi down to the level of articl and shorter video , and you have differ consider , no ? Especi around exclus . Im tri to imagin ani sort of leverag .Well , let say the content in question requir a lot less invest . First of all , there go to be a lot more competit . It veri hard to compet with the video game Call of Duti . It a lot easier to come up with close substitut for someth that requir a lot less invest . The substitut concern on a platform is a lot higher .The most profound piec of thi  the trend that I find fascin  is that everi year , peopl look at thi and say , these are the product and servic that are right now be transact on these multisid platform , but there a limit . There alway higher-level , higher-valu product and servic that are extrem out of reach . Now wer say , oh , there are all these on-demand economi platform like Taskrabbit , but , sure , thi is limit to low-skil labor or thing that veri easili contract . The realiti is , there will be platform for pretti much everyth  pretti much ani product or servic that we can imagin . It go to happen .', 'Each Saturday , Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac , technolog report at The New York Time , review the week news , offer analysi and mayb a joke or two about the most import develop in the tech industri .Farhad : Hey , Mike ! How it go ? Iv been in Africa for three week . I bet you miss me a lot . It must be difficult to tri to deciph the week tech news without me to guid you along . Well , dri your eye , Im back !Mike : I start go to therapi to deal with your absenc . Turn out you and I are fine , but I have a whole lot of other issu . I hope we have good insur .Farhad : So , on to the news . Rememb the huge battl between the F.B.I . and Appl over the San Bernardino , Calif. , terrorist phone ? It all sort of fizzl thi week : CB News report that after the F.B.I . final got into the phone ( without Apple help ) , it found noth of signific on the devic .Mike : LOL . After all that , noth . It almost too perfect of an end to the saga .Farhad : But noth didnt come cheap ! The bureau spent at least $ 1.3 million to get into the phone , Jame Comey , the F.B.I. director , told a secur confer thi week .Ha anyon spent so much for so littl befor ? I mean , other than what our boss pay you ?Mike : I consid the free sandwich left in the confer room at N.Y.T . HQ to be part of my benefit package.Farhad : O.K. , so there were a lot of corpor earn thi week . Let run through them in a flash . The first three tell a familiar stori  the era of person comput is well and truli over .IBM report a huge declin in revenu and profit , but the number were in line with what analyst were expect . Intel , on the other hand , whif on it earn number , and it announc layoff of 12,000 worker , around 11 percent of it work forc . And if Intel didnt prove that surviv the crash of the PC busi isnt easi , Microsoft came along to underscor the point , announc a dip in sale and profit .Mike : I still have no clue what these compani are go to do to , like , stop fire peopl . I guess just becom a lot smaller ?Oh also , I start watch back episod of Halt and Catch Fire on Netflix and man , that show rule . It deal with the rise of the PC and the era when IBM , or Big Blue , reign suprem . A differ era entir .Farhad : Oh  I kind of hate it . Anyway , newer tech compani arent fare ani better . Googl also miss analysts earn expect , in part becaus of lower price paid for Internet ad . And Googl wa hit by anoth storm  European regul announc the start of what look to be a long-run investig into whether the compani is use it Android oper system to block competitor from users phone .Final , there wa Yahoo , the perenni basket case of the web industri . It earn report wa also dismal : revenu fell 11 percent sinc last year , and the firm lost $ 99 million in the quarter . But the report wa essenti overshadow by Yahoo effort to sell it Internet busi . Bid for those beleagu asset were due thi week ; among the contend are Verizon and a few privat equiti firm . Yahoo board will now have to look through the bid to figur out which , if ani , could save thi ail patient . Wish them luck !Mike : Poor Yahoo execut will onli have their ten of million of dollar in prenegoti sever packag to turn to for comfort after their compani is sold for part . What a tragedi .Meanwhil Im liter buy case of ramen on Amazon to save money .Farhad : But let leav today tech giant  and your dinner plan  asid for a bit . Instead let talk about tomorrow giant : Uber . As you report , the ride-shar compani settl a long battl in California and Massachusett thi week over the legal statu of it driver . So doe thi final put to rest the controversi over Uber practic of keep it driver as contractor rather than employe ?Mike : In short , not realli . The settlement  which still is subject to the accept of the judg presid over the case  appli onli to California and Massachusett driver . There are still lawsuit in a bunch of other state , includ Arizona , Florida , Pennsylvania . Im sure more will pop up over time , sinc everyon love to sue a compani with deep pocket .Here what matter : Asid from the $ 100 million Uber said it would pay driver involv in the suit , the compani conced to a bunch of new rule and polici that make thing at least slightli better for driver .For one , driver can ask for tip now , someth they werent abl to do befor ( unlik Lyft , where they can get tip insid the app ) . Uber will also creat a union-styl driver association in California and Massachusett  just dont call them union !  so that driver can air their grievanc . And driver wont automat be deactiv for cancel too mani trip over time .That seem like a list of way Uber can defend itself in other state in which it face lawsuit . Essenti , the further away Uber get from act like actual employ with driver  that is , the less control it exert over the work forc  the more room it ha to call it driver partners and not employe .Farhad : Those actual sound like pretti good reform . If Uber doe use thi settlement as a templat for other state , it seem like it could be creat what some labor expert had been call for when thi contractor-versus-employe disput first came along  a new , third categori of employ that sat somewher between full-tim and independ contractor work .Thi settlement sound a bit like that situat : Uber driver get some perk of employ , includ peopl to complain to , and some measur of job secur ( even if it probabl pretti weak ) . But they dont get to be full employe  mean the compani doe not have to pay them benefit , and the driver are free to work as much or as littl as theyd like .Am I wrong to see thi as a pretti good middle-of-the-road fix to a thorni problem that had been vex lot of on-demand compani ?Mike : Onli partli ! As usual .The counterargu for some of thi is that Uber can still shut driver out of the app for short period of time if they make too mani trip cancel . That a level of control that one could argu should be reserv for an employer-employe relationship .Anyway , the moral of the stori is thi seem to have been larg defus , though not entir over and done with . Watch other state and the subsequ litig close .Good to have you back in town ! Also , thank you for the bag of biltong you brought back . I ate everi last bit and have yet to develop a stomach bug .Farhad : Your welcom ! I look forward to snack from your next vacat .

When the ship return to port , they disembark befor everyon els .It wa alway the intent to make the Haven somewhat obscur so it wasnt in the face of the mass ,  said Kevin Sheehan , Norwegian former chief execut , who help design the Escap with the hope of attract a richer clientel . That segment of the popul want to be surround by peopl with similar characteristics.With dispar in wealth greater than at ani time sinc the Gild Age , the gap is widen between the highli affluent  who find themselv behind the velvet rope of today economi  and everyon els .It repres a degre of econom and social stratif unseen in America sinc the day of Teddi Roosevelt , J. P. Morgan and the rigidli separ class on the Titan a centuri ago .What is differ today , though , is that compani have becom much more adept at identifi their top custom and know which psycholog button to push . The goal is to creat extravag and exclus for the select few , even if it stir up resent elsewher . In fact , research ha shown , a littl envi can be good for the bottom line .When top-dollar travel switch plane in Atlanta , New York and other citi , Delta ferri them between termin in a Porsch , what the airlin call a surprise-and-delight service. Last month , Walt Disney World began offer after-hour access to visitor who want to avoid the crowd .

We are do a much wors job of live out the egalitarian dream that ha been our hallmark.Emmanuel Saez , a professor of econom at the Univers of California , Berkeley , estim that the top 1 percent of American household now control 42 percent of the nation wealth , up from less than 30 percent two decad ago . The top 0.1 percent account for 22 percent , nearli doubl the 1995 proport .But even as incom inequ and the wealth gap stoke the discont that ha emerg as a power forc in thi year presidenti elect , for American busi it repres someth els entir . From cruis ship oper and casino to amus park and airlin , the rise of the 1 percent spell opportun and profit .Today , ever greater resourc are be invest in win market share at the veri top of the pyramid , sometim at the cost of diminish servic for the rest of the public . While middle-class incom are stagnat , the period sinc the end of the Great Recess ha been a boom time for the veri rich and the busi that cater to them .From 2010 to 2014 , the number of American household with at least $ 1 million in financi asset jump by nearli one-third , to just under seven million , accord to a studi by the Boston Consult Group . For the $ 1 million-plu cohort , estim wealth grew by 7.2 percent annual from 2010 to 2014 , eight time the pace of gain for famili with less than $ 1 million .You go where the money is ,  said Steven Fazzari , a professor of econom at Washington Univers in St. Loui . Thi is where compani are innov and where there is demand.In mani way , the rise of the velvet rope revers the great democrat of travel and leisur , and other element of American life , in the post-World War II era . As the Jet Set gave way to budget airlin , in place like airport and theme park even the wealthiest often rub shoulder with hoi polloi .These day , whether the provid is a privat compani or a public agenc , special treatment for the veri rich isnt person , it busi . Late last year , public offici in Lo Angel agre to leas a separ facil at LAX to a privat firm that would serv celebr or anyon els will to pay $ 1,800 to skip the traffic jam and line at the main termin .Of cours , it could be more extrem , and in the past it wa .The Titan , in the earli 20th centuri , separ the differ class of travel with metal gate .

But get it right in realiti is veri , veri hard.As compani separ their clientel , a debat ha develop over just how obviou the distinct should be . Some expert , like David Clark , who work with leisur industri giant as a princip at PricewaterhouseCoop , say that it is best to be open about what amount to a money-bas cast system .It about transpar ,  he said . What custom hate is when your tri to hide stuff and are not be honest with them.Mani compani , though , have discov that offer ordinari custom just a whiff of the rarefi air can actual enhanc the bottom line , even if it stir a certain amount of envi and resent .As coach passeng pile into giant 747 and A380 , for exampl , a glimps of a shower or privat suit creat a marker in people mind ,  said Alex Dichter , a director at McKinsey who work with major airlin . A lot of brand use product like these as an aspir tool , and class segreg can creat someth to which peopl can aspire.While choic for the rich are expand , poorer American are benefit less from product innov , accord to new research by Xavier Jaravel , a graduat student in econom at Harvard . Whether they are sell fanci cookwar , natur chees or singl malt Scotch , purveyor of good aim at the wealthi are compet more and offer new product . Downscal item like can meat or tobacco arent draw as mani new entrant into the market .There is also increas demand from the most affluent shopper .

For everyon els , spend grew less than 10 percent .And with the rise of the Internet and big data , compani can pinpoint and favor these wealthiest custom in way unimagin even a decad ago . At the high end , we can get into real psychograph and know who spend more time at the concierg or goe ski in Februari ,  said Bjorn Hanson , who teach cours on tourism and hospit manag at New York Univers .For compani tri to entic money custom , that mean identifi and anticip what they want . The premium custom doesnt want to be ask question ,  said Mr. Clark of PricewaterhouseCoop . They dont want friction . They want thing to happen through osmosis.But for peopl at the lower end of the market , as well as in the middl , plenti of friction remain . The trade-off is that the amount of hassl is precis calibr to just how much you are will to pay .At the low end , people expect have fundament chang ,  Mr. Clark said . Becaus it a fraction of the cost , peopl say , Im will to take some discomfort becaus my wallet is stay full.Execut describ the virtu of elit segment with a direct that might well serv as fodder for support of Occupi Wall Street or Senat Berni Sander . At it debut in 2006 , the Haven wa swamp by tourist from regular quarter who paid $ 200 to upgrad to one of it 40 or so room , Mr. Sheehan recal .So he order an immedi halt to the upgrad , which undercut profit margin and undermin the Haven main sell point , exclus .We need to fill the Haven by get the right peopl on the ship ,  said Mr. Sheehan , who step down as chief execut last year . When the mass overwhelm the group in the Haven , they didnt have the experi they were look for.Mr. Sheehan focu on wealthier travel prove prescient . Norwegian stock ha surg . And as the compani design new vessel in recent year , the Haven becam more defin  with it own pool , loung , bar and restaur  and more isol from the rest of the ship .With the launch of the 4,100-passeng Epic in 2010 , a guest could enter the key card for access , and never leav ,  said Andi Stuart , Norwegian presid .And by last year , when the even newer Escap sail on it maiden voyag , the Haven 95 stateroom were locat so high up in the forward part of the ship that even guest in compar expens stateroom might remain unawar of it exist . Depend on the season , a room in the Haven might cost a coupl $ 10,000 for a weeklong cruis vs. $ 3,000 for an ordinari stateroom elsewher on the ship .While the Haven is hidden , or at least camouflag , on Norwegian cruis ship , it archriv Royal Caribbean , by contrast , make no secret of what is avail to passeng who pay the most . It Royal Suit class isnt a ship within a ship , but it serv much the same function with one signific differ : Regular passeng can push their nose up against the glass , liter .On Royal Caribbean new ship Anthem , diner must first walk past the frost glass window of Coastal Kitchen , reserv for suit occup , befor they can crowd around the buffet tabl of the open-to-everyon Windjamm Caf .There are no chafe dish in sight at the Coastal Kitchen , where the order of the day is white tabl cloth and sit-down servic . The atmospher is as calm and leisur as Windjamm is hectic , although suit guest are free to dine at the latter if they like .Royal Caribbean busi approach contrast strikingli with Norwegian .While Norwegian execut decid to mostli hide the Haven from view , Royal Caribbean went with transpar . It the American way ,  said Michael Bayley , presid of Royal Caribbean . I think societi is prepar to accept that if you pay more for certain element , then you deserv them.Mr. Bayley and Royal Caribbean chairman , Richard Fain , say they ultim decid against the ship-within-a-ship concept after studi the Haven .That not the mojo or the cultur of Royal Caribbean ,  Mr. Bayley said . The idea of segreg peopl into a class system is un-American . But if you live on Central Park , you are go to pay more . That how the system works.As ha been the case elsewher in the leisur industri in recent year , Royal Caribbean ha becom more comfort with heighten the contrast between the treatment mete out to ordinari passeng and the level of servic reserv for the top tier . Royal Caribbean ha alway consid the psycholog of it guest when it design new ship or introduc new amen , said Adam Goldstein , the company chief oper offic , but there ha been a shift in passeng expect in recent year .For a long time there wa an accept that outsid the door of your room , you were on an equal foot ,  he said . We didnt attempt to have ani differenti in how servic were delivered.Sinc the late 1990 , howev , there ha been a huge evolut , mayb a revolut in attitud ,  Mr. Goldstein said . In addit to larger room or softer sheet , big spender want to be coddl nowaday . They are look for constant valid that they are a higher-valu custom ,  he said . For exampl , room servic request from Royal Suit occup are automat rout to a number differ from the one use by regular passeng , who get slower , less person servic .With a week in a top Royal Suit cost upward of $ 30,000 , compar with $ 4,000 for an ordinari cabin , the focu is on veri affluent travel , and we have no troubl fill these room ,  Mr. Bayley said .In May , the compani will roll out it Royal Geni program  essenti a person servant for the highest spender on board . Royal Geni will research their guests prefer even befor they come aboard and come up with surpris like in-room drink with their favorit vodka or Scotch .Even though thi kind of pamper might be good for busi , and delight those on the right side of the velvet rope , the gap between the privileg and the rest may ultim leav everyon feel uneasi , said Barri J. Nalebuff , a professor of manag at Yale .If Im in the back of the plane , I want to hiss at the peopl in first class ,  said Mr. Nalebuff , who ha advis mani Fortun 100 compani .

Sinc oat requir less herbicid spray than mani other grain , there is less risk of pollut and groundwat contamin ,  it say .The lawsuit , file in Feder District Court in New York and California , contend that such statement are fals and mislead . There is noth unlaw about Quaker Oats grow and process method ,  the suit say . What is unlaw is Quaker claim that Quaker Oat is someth that it is not in order to capit on grow consum demand for health , natur products.In a statement , the Quaker Oat Compani said that it did not add glyphos dure ani part of the mill process but that it might be appli by farmer to certain grain befor harvest .The compani said it put the oat it receiv through a cleans process . Ani level of glyphos that may remain are trace amount and significantli below ani limit which have been set by the E.P.A . as safe for human consumpt ,  the compani said .A test paid for by lawyer for the plaintiff , the Richman Law Group , found glyphos at a level of 1.18 part per million in a sampl of Quaker Oat Quick 1-Minut . Thi is roughli 4 percent of the 30 part per million that the Environment Protect Agenc allow in cereal grain .An independ lab in California did the test , use liquid chromatography-mass spectrometri , a techniqu wide use by medic and chemic lab and pharmaceut research .Although test wa done onli on Quick 1-Minut , the lawsuit also make claim against Quaker Oat Old-Fashion and Quaker Steel Cut Oat .Glyphos is one of the most wide use pesticid around the world . The Monsanto Compani began sell the pesticid in the 1970 . But it wa the introduct of genet engin crop two decad later that fuel the sharp increas in the use of the pesticid . Those crop now account for most of the corn , soy , sugar beet and canola grown in the Unit State .Glyphos also is wide use in home garden , on golf cours and other place .Last year , the World Health Organ classifi glyphos as a probable carcinogen . Sinc then , environment and consum group have begun to focu their effort on the pesticid , and a grow number of report on glyphos in food have surfac .Earlier thi year , the Food and Drug Administr said it plan to begin test some food for glyphos .The biotech industri and food compani contend that the level of glyphos found in product fall well below limit set by govern offici . The European Union set the averag daili level of intak for glyphos at 0.3 milligram per kilogram , while the Environment Protect Agenc set it at 1.75 milligram per kilogram daili .Kim Richman , the lead lawyer of the firm repres the plaintiff , said the amount of glyphos wa not the issu . The issu is that Quaker advertis these product as 100 percent natur , and glyphos in ani amount is not natur ,  he said .Oat are not a genet engin crop . But glyphos is increasingli be use as a dessicant to dri out crop to speed harvest .The lawsuit wa file over the weekend in New York and California , and , Mr. Richman said , would be file in other state thi week .The plaintiff are seek refund for purchas . They also are ask that PepsiCo either be requir to reformul the product or disclos the presenc of glyphos in them .', 'WASHINGTON  The Justic Depart said Friday night that it had gain access on it own to a lock iPhon use by a Brooklyn drug dealer , the second time in less than a month that it had unlock such a devic after initi insist it could do so onli with Apple help .In a short letter to a feder judg in the Eastern District of New York , prosecutor said that an unidentifi person had given the phone passcod to investig .

Both former offici now work with technolog compani like Appl at a corpor consult firm that Mr. Chertoff found , and both are now back Appl  and not the F.B.I. , with which they onc work  in it fight to keep it iPhon encrypt and privat .They are among more than a half-dozen promin former nation secur offici who , to vari degre , have support Appl and the idea of impenetr end-to-end encryption dure a furiou nation debat over the balanc between privaci and secur in the digit age .In white paper , op- articl , confer , newspap and televis interview and elsewher , the former offici have made their support for Appl clear . While their former job in the govern are alway featur promin in their public appear , their current busi affili often go unment .The barrag of support ha given Appl a public relat boost in a fight it onc seem destin to lose , but it ha surpris and anger some law enforc offici .These offici question whether the busi relationship that some of the former offici now have with Appl and other Silicon Valley compani  job that usual pay far abov their former govern salari  are behind their enthusiast advocaci of privaci and encrypt .Among those who have voic support for Apple posit are Mike McConnel , a former director of nation intellig ; David H. Petraeu , a former director of the Central Intellig Agenc ; R. Jame Woolsey , anoth former C.I.A . director ; and Richard A. Clark , a former top White Hous counterterror offici . Like Mr. Chertoff and Mr. Hayden , they all now work with firm that have tie to the technolog sector , record show .It is unclear how much money Appl and other technolog firm involv in the F.B.I . litig have paid to the firm where the former offici now work ; most of the firm declin to discuss their privat busi deal , call them irrelev .Mr. McConnel , who serv as nation intellig director under Presid Obama and Georg W. Bush , argu that keep the Unit States comput system safe from rival nation and rogu hacker should outweigh the F.B.I. interest in unlock smartphon in crimin case .I believ ubiquit encrypt is someth that the nation is go to have to embrac ,  Mr. McConnel , who is now a senior execut advis at the consult giant Booz Allen Hamilton , said in a telephon interview . Appl ha been lead the fight to go down that path , Googl is right behind and Microsoft will be there befor too long.Booz Allen execut vice presid , Thad W. Allen , a former Coast Guard command , ha also voic support for Apple posit on encrypt , becaus , he said , American technolog firm need to stay competit in the intern market .Booz Allen ha made a recent push to form strateg alliances with Appl and other technolog compani , execut said .Mr. McConnel and other former nation secur offici said that their work in the privat sector had no impact on their public support for Appl . Not everyon agre .Theyv follow the money and adopt pro-privaci posit that they wouldnt have dream of take while in govern ,  said Tim Shorrock , a writer and foreign polici comment who wrote a book on the busi side of intellig .Some current law enforc offici say they have been anger by the former officials sharp and sometim person critic of the F.B.I . ( Mr. Hayden , for instanc , said in an interview , I think Jim Comey wrong ,  refer to the bureau director . )The Justic Depart and the F.B.I . declin to comment . But Stewart Baker , a former Homeland Secur offici who is one of the few former offici publicli back the F.B.I . in the encrypt debat , said it wa frustrat to see old colleagu now echo what he see as erron assert from Appl about the threat to it customers privaci .Still , he conced that the effort had been effect . What start as a disput over a lock iPhon use by a terrorist in San Bernardino , Calif. , ha instead becom a broader one over privaci and comput secur , Mr. Baker said , and theyr get a lot of peopl to side with Apple.So strong is their support that Appl ha includ comment from sever of the former offici in it legal plead . One file includ a comment from Mr. Chertoff at a confer last month that if Appl were forc to creat a back door to get around it encrypt , it would be like creat a bacteriolog weapon.Anoth vote of support that Appl ha includ in it legal file came from Mr. Hayden , who is one of the top execut at Mr. Chertoff consult firm , the Chertoff Group . America is more secur  America is more safe  with unbreak end-to-end encrypt ,  Mr. Hayden , who led both the Nation Secur Agenc and the C.I.A. , told a televis interview a week after the Appl fight broke out .Mr. Chertoff firm also produc a 28-page report thi year on the valu of encrypt , and it deal with technolog compani on secur issu are extens . Appl wa also a corpor sponsor of a cybersecur confer it host in Octob .Mr. Hayden ha acknowledg that he might have come down differ in the Appl disput when he wa the head of the N.S.A . If face with an unbreak devic , he might have gone straight to the budget offic and said , Im go to need anoth $ 500 million becaus Im go to kick my way in ,  he told the American Enterpris Institut , a conserv think tank .Still , Mr. Hayden said in a telephon interview that hi strong stanc on encrypt date back year and wa not influenc by hi post-govern work at the Chertoff Group .It doesnt have ani relev to what I think about thi ,  he said . I answer thi on it merits.Mr. Chertoff wa travel and unavail for comment , the Chertoff Group said . The firm declin to discuss it financi deal with Appl .But Mr. Chertoff acknowledg in a panel discuss last month that dure hi time insid the govern , there were situat in which I knew I had to move heaven and earth to find out where a threat wa come from . Hi current focu on encrypt , he said , is complementari to that previou stanc on secur and not contradictori .The encrypt debat erupt in Februari after the F.B.I . said it need Apple technic help to get into the iPhon use by Sy Rizwan Farook , one of the San Bernardino attack .Initi , the F.B.I . appear pois to win the battl for public opinion . The attack , which kill 14 peopl , wa the worst terrorist strike on American soil sinc the Sept. 11 attack . Mr. Farook wa dead ; the phone owner  the counti of San Bernardino , where he work  had consent to the search ; and the Justic Depart had a court order to do it .But Appl ha sinc gain public sympathi , with poll give it a small but grow edg over the F.B.I . in support , and the battl ha essenti end in a draw now that the F.B.I . ha manag to get into the phone by pay an outsid group to help hack it .With the F.B.I . still push to open other lock phone , Apple backer are prepar for a long fight .Mr. Hayden , the former N.S.A . director , warn listen last month at the American Enterpris Institut that the flare-up in the San Bernardino case wa not a one-and-done.Encrypt is at the root of Internet commun , Mr. Hayden said , and there is noth we can do to stop that.

It wa the third consecut quarter of posit result for the compani , suggest that it may have turn the corner after a pain slide .Sale in it store open at least a year grew 6.2 percent across the countri , and the import American market increas such sale at a better rate than Wall Street expect .Revenu remain mostli flat , fall 1 percent to $ 5.9 billion , though revenu wa up 3 percent when adjust for currenc swing . Profit grew to $ 1.1 billion from $ 811.5 million in the period last year .Steve Easterbrook , chief execut of McDonald , said the company decis to offer some of it most popular breakfast item , like Egg McMuffin and hash brown , throughout the day had paid off beyond it expect .And promot deal that the compani offer thi year , like McPick 2 , also propel sale , he said in a confer call with invest analyst .But he also said oper chang , such as retool the company organ to have better insight into individu market and it decis to commit to sourc cage-fre egg , were also help draw custom back to the restaur and in a way that would stick . We have a restless energi here , and wev just got go ,  Mr. Easterbrook said .Other restaur chain keenli watch McDonald , and it action have kick off activ at Wendy and Taco Bell and concern among less direct competitor like Brinker Intern , which run the full-servic restaur Chili and Maggiano .In a confer call with invest analyst on Tuesday , Wyman Robert , chief execut of Brinker , said that Chili wa re-evaluating it 2 for $ 20 promot , which allow custom to choos one appet and two main meal from a menu .McDonald start the battl when it replac it Dollar Menu with a limit time McPick 2 for $ 2 menu in Januari . Consum were excit by the three-piec mozzarella stick on that menu , but franchise were less wow .So in late Februari , the compani chang the menu and term of the deal , offer a choic of two item for $ 5  and it took mozzarella stick off the menu , incit a protest on social media .That start a prolifer of so-cal bundl deal . Burger King respond with a two-for- $ 5 deal that includ a popular chocol chip cooki , and Wendy introduc a 4-for- $ 4 promot .Not to be outdon , Yum Brand step up with a $ 5 Flavor Menu that at least temporarili ha help jolt it Pizza Hut restaur out of the doldrum . At KFC , Yum offer a $ 20 Fill Up dinner , and Taco Bell ha begun offer a $ 1 breakfast menu .These bundl meal seem to be reson with these chains custom and draw more traffic to their store ,  said Mark Kalinowski , an invest analyst at Nomura Secur .Mr. Kalinowski said McDonald breakfast program also contribut to it better-than-expect perform in the quarter .

So let me just say that.', 'BAKERSFIELD , Calif.  Dark chocol is in . So , too , is beef jerki . And full-fat ice cream ? You bet .Driven by fast-chang definit of what is healthi to eat , peopl are turn to food they shun just a coupl of year ago . Studi now suggest that not all fat , for exampl , necessarili contribut to weight gain or heart problem . That ha left compani scrambl to push some food that they thought had long pass their popular peak  and health advoc wonder what went wrong .Under the new think , not all fat is bad , and neither are all salti food . A stigma among the public remain for sugar substitut , but less so for cane sugar , at least in moder . And all of those attribut are weigh against qualiti like simplic and tast .I think the risk-reward equat ha chang ,  said Steve French , a manag partner at the Natur Market Institut , a research firm , said .Edy ice cream , known as Dreyer west of the Rocki , is a case in point . Edy sold 10.8 percent more of it Edy Grand Ice Cream , a full-fat ice cream , in the 52 week that end Feb. 21 compar with the year befor , accord to IRI , a data and research firm . Other full-fat ice cream also had sale gain .Over the same period , Edy sold 4.8 percent less of it Slow-Churn Ice Cream , made with a process that lower the fat content . When the product wa introduc in 2004 , it wa promot as have less fat and fewer calori  and sale soar .Now , that sort of market is gone . Instead , the compani ha retool some of it Slow-Churn product to make them with fewer ingredi and to includ cane sugar rather than high-fructos corn syrup , which mani consum dont like . Label on those ice cream will also tell consum that they contain no genet engin ingredi .The devil , of cours , is in the detail of those new scientif find . None of the new studi , for instanc , recommend eat as much bacon as you want .The new definit of modern health is veri differ from the tradit view , which wa to reduc fat , sugar and sodium ,  said Robert Kilmer , presid of Nestl Dreyer Ice Cream , a divis of Nestl USA . Healthi now is about what in my food and where did it come from.Food compani have been work feverishli over the last sever year to offer what consum perceiv as improv nutrit content and healthier food . Sale of product made from organ ingredi have risen sharpli in recent year , for exampl .Mar Food , a divis of the privat held Mar candi compani whose brand includ Uncl Ben and Dolmio , reduc sodium by over 20 percent in mani of it product and recent announc a plan to go even further . And Gener Mill is elimin artifici color and flavor from it cereal  no more neon hue in Trix .But consum are constantli recalcul the pro and con of the food they eat  lead to some unexpect food rise in popular .For exampl , in 2015 , American check the fat content on food label less often than they did in 2006 , accord to research from the Natur Market Institut . Theyr focus more on the list of ingredi , a product environment impact and anim welfar  the famou Farm episod in Portlandia in which a waitress can tell diner the name of the chicken theyll be eat remain relev five year after it wa first shown .And dont forget about tast . A major of American say they valu tast more than how healthi a food is .Thi can be frustrat for food execut , who spent year get salt , sugar and fat out of a wide varieti of product , pay high cost in develop and market along the way . Michael Sharp , the research scientist at Nestl who ha presid over the reformul of it Slow-Churn ice cream , note that all of the ingredi he is work to elimin today were origin ad to the product for good reason .The ingredi wev subtract either had some function on their own or improv the function of other ingredi ,  Mr. Sharp said . Corn syrup add a lot of bodi and bulk to a product  but the consum doesnt want it today.Nutrit expert are watch the shift warili . Margo Wootan , director of nutrit polici at the Center for Scienc in the Public Interest , a research and advocaci group , note that compani have gone a long way toward reduc or elimin satur fat , which rais cholesterol in the blood and increas the risk of heart diseas .The American Heart Associ and other health advocaci group have long recommend limit consumpt of satur fat . But in recent year , studi have suggest that mayb satur fat is not as bad as onc thought . One analysi of research on satur fat , which gener some critic , blur the link between it and heart diseas . Anoth studi conclud that skim milk did not appear to restrict weight gain among young children .That rethink seem to have encourag some consum to return to full-fat food . Edy French Vanilla Grand ice cream , for exampl , ha four gram of satur fat in everi half-cup . A half-cup of the same flavor in it Slow-Churn varieti , the recent less popular option , ha 1.5 gram of satur fat .Similarli , the public appear to have been persuad by some evid that eat dark chocol is good for the heart . Technavio , a market research firm , predict that sale would increas an averag of more than 8 percent a year through 2019 .But the feder govern also recommend a limit on total fat consumpt  the combin of bad and good fat . An eight-ounc bar of Ghirardelli 72 % Intens Dark chocol suppli more than the government daili recommend for satur fat and more than three-quart of the recommend for total fat .There are recommend limit on total fat that I think have sort of gotten lost in the market ,  Ms. Wootan said . There noth in scienc that tell you it healthi to eat as much fat as you want , just as long as it not satur fat.Anoth sore point among nutritionist is the rise sale of jerki , onc regard as littl more than a sodium deliveri mechan . Now , as consum clamor for food high in protein , jerki ha becom a popular option . One ounc deliv about a quarter of the daili recommend amount of protein and cost roughli $ 2.50 .Sale of meat snack like jerki shot up 46.9 percent from 2011 to 2015 , to more than $ 2.6 billion , accord to Nielsen , a market research firm .Jerki is manli , jerki is kind of rednecki and jerki can even be kind of offens if peopl dont know what it is ,  said Troy Link , chief execut of Link Snack , a family-own snack food busi . So we chang thing up and began call it a protein snack , and now jerki is be eaten by higher-end health eater who havent been involv in the categori before.Link Snacks most popular product , Jack Link Teriyaki Beef Jerki , deliv 12 gram of protein and just 80 calori in a one-ounc serv  and one-fifth the daili recommend amount of sodium . Mr. Link said the compani had work to reduc the sodium in it product , along with get rid of monosodium glutam and nitrit .For the most part , sodium ha becom good again , and I think certain fat have becom good again , too ,  he said .At the end of the day ,  he said , peopl want someth that tast good.', 'MARIJUANA advoc are team up with Madison Avenu to tri to make pot palat to mainstream American  and to the advertis that want to reach them .High Time , the 42-year-old must-hav magazin for the cannabi enthusiast , ha collabor with Spark & Honey , an Omnicom advertis agenc , on a report meant to prompt big-pictur think in the marijuana industri . The paper , Rebrand Marijuana ,  wa releas April 20 , the unoffici pot holiday .Through the slow legal and regulatori process ,  the report note , marijuana is open up opportun across a varieti of industri , most of which have noth to do with yesterday stoner weed.The partnership is an unusu step for a mainstream ad agenc , which would usual focu on individu brand rather than an entir  and not uniformli legal  industri .We are definit ahead of the curv here ,  said Sean Mahoney , Spark & Honey vice presid and editori director . There still kind of a taboo around it.But with the marijuana industri pois to produc billion in legal revenu a year if it is legal throughout the countri  a big if  Mr. Mahoney and other are say it is time to rethink that squeamish . Recreat marijuana use is legal in four state and the District of Columbia , and about two dozen state allow medicin use .Larri Linietski , chief oper offic at High Time , say it make financi sens for promin brand to advertis to cannabi user . He list the group most attract attribut , accord to market research : predominantli male , a rang of age , passion about the product , social , educ and healthi .The guy run the marathon next to you is also a stoner ,  he said . Thi is happen . Wer ask the media world to watch thi space closely.Although big brand have been reluct to target marijuana user , some smaller mainstream brand have shown interest . Two San Francisco-area compani  the tech compani Tile and the Lagunita Brew Compani  have advertis in High Time , for exampl .But even support compani may be reluct to public their marijuana connect . Tile declin to discuss the issu , say through a spokeswoman that the Tile team isnt prepar to talk about their market practic just yet.Lagunita , born in the pot-friendli San Francisco area , take the opposit approach . The breweri sponsor the Four-Twenti Game  mainli 4.2-mile foot race  and make The Waldos Special Ale , a beer name for the foursom who invent the 420 marijuana code .Lagunita , which recent sold a 50 percent stake to Heineken , see marijuana user more as kindr spirit than as a money sourc , said Karen Hamilton , a spokeswoman for the breweri .Wev kind of been propon of the whole thing , so we have a differ perspect ,  she said . Wev been in Northern California for 23 year . What are you go to do ? Although Ms. Hamilton said she suspect that other alcohol produc will be among the next major brand to enter the cannabi arena , they and other compani are take their time .The High Time home page illustr the challeng . On a recent afternoon , everi ad wa for marijuana-rel product and servic  mostli vapor and tool for grow plant .Still , the mainstream advertis dam will burst at some point , said Gari Wilcox , an advertis professor at the Univers of Texa at Austin , even if marijuana remain illeg in much of the countri . Big brand are simpli wait and watch , he said .Thi is the Wild West ,  he said . If they can see an impact on their bottom line , that would do it.High Time and Mr. Mahoney compar the cannabi issu to marriag equal . Although same-sex marriag wa not legal in everi state , some compani show support earli on and that reson with consum .Everybodi ha a one- to two-year timelin where they want to look around ,  said Matt Stang , the chief revenu offic at High Time . If your go to play in thi space in a year and a half , whi not play now and get ahead of it ? Spark & Honey parent compani , Omnicom , wa recept to the marijuana research , Mr. Mahoney said . Among the agency sell point is the concept of marijuana for the 1 percent rather than the Cheech and Chong stereotyp .We sort of lean toward the stoner aesthet , but there a high end to thi ,  Mr. Mahoney said , note that affluent medicin user want classier accouterments that do not make you feel like your sneak drug into school.One section of the report is titl Haut Cannabi Cuisine and refer to cannabi cevich and sear wagyu New York strip steak with cannabi rub .A gourmet dinner is appeal on mani differ level ,  the report say . It look and tast delici and draw commun around a share passion . And now , it can make you high.Mr. Mahoney said he would not be surpris to see cannabis-infus food becom the industry first wide advertis product . But it is hard to ignor the younger user who might be particularli recept to , say , an advertis for snack food or fast-food establish . It would make sens for those kind of product to sponsor a marijuana event , he said .Brand are tri to reach thi audienc of millenni that are so hard to reach ,  Mr. Stang said .

Today , sport not onli drive the existenti battl between media content and distribut leader , but it is play an increas role in the struggl for domin among the compet technolog platform . Earlier thi month , Twitter beat out Amazon and Facebook for the digit stream right to Nation Footbal Leagu Thursday night game .It is hard to believ that in 1990 , when Hearst bought 20 percent of ESPN for a song , RJR Nabisco had long been tri to unload the stake . The remain 80 percent share today repres the largest part of the largest media conglomer in the world : the Walt Disney Compani . And sport play an increas role in more than just the corpor realm . The seemingli perpetu growth of the price of sport right ha releg a shock percentag of American famili to effect poverti onc they have paid for the basic cabl video bundl that incorpor these cost . Thi phenomenon implic public polici consider as well .Given thi backdrop , the subtitl of a new book by Matthew Futterman , Player : The Stori of Sport and Money , and the Visionari Who Fought to Creat a Revolution ( Simon & Schuster ) , could not be more time . Mr. Futterman , a sportswrit for The Wall Street Journal , take us on a half-centuri tour span a varieti of wide recogn and lesser-known sport figur and competit that have play role in the industry develop . Mr. Futterman is right that understand the histori is crucial to understand the current state of sport and the possibl of chang .As enjoy as the journey sometim is , the problem with the book is reflect in the titl itself of Players. Mr. Futterman focus on one level of a complex , multilay industri whose econom are not primarili driven by how individu athlet negoti their salari and licens deal .Much more consequenti is the structur of the game , team , leagu and feder and their relationship with brand , broadcast , cabl channel and increasingli divers potenti distribut outlet . It is simpli not possibl to tell the stori of sport and money without broaden the narr .Unfortun , half of the book is taken up with tale of the player in golf , tenni and basebal who fought pivot battl to improv their respect sports compens structur . The topic of escal right fee is taken up , onli in the final chapter , and then perfunctorili . There is no mention at all , for instanc , of the young Fox network unexpect decis to submit a huge pre-empt bid for N.F.L . right in 1993 . That move upend a relationship between footbal and CB that date back to the 1950 and fundament alter the trajectori of the cost of all sport right sinc .Mr. Futterman emphasi on the player ha the virtu of lend itself to interest person histori . But the frequent flashback are disori , and the detail descript of variou sport match are onli sometim relev to the plot . The success of a goofi show in the 1970 call The Superstars in which famou athlet from divers disciplin compet against each other in a seri of haphazardli organ event make a good stori . It demonstr the increas import of the individu athletes celebr rel to the game or team themselv . Thi point could be made , howev , without a play-by-play of the relay race or tug-of-war competit .As a practic matter , emphas the player at the expens of structur consider make it imposs for the reader to follow the money . Four of the five best compens player in the world are from box and soccer  sport that Mr. Futterman either ignor entir or discuss briefli . By contrast , none of the top 10 salari are found in either footbal or basebal , two sport examin close .Players doe not provid reader with the tool to understand whi thi might be . There is also no mention of the overal size of the industri or the mix of revenu between gate , media right , sponsorship and merchandis . And the rel size of the variou sport within the industri is not discuss and bear no relat to how much time Mr. Futterman spend on each .Mr. Futterman is as much a sport fan as he is a sportswrit , and the narrow preoccup of Players reflect thi perspect . The earli chapter champion the interest of the exploit player who dare to wrestl a fair share of the pie from the team owner and leagu . Mr. Futterman argu that empowering the player allow them to transform modern sports by improv the qualiti of play and profession of the overal enterpris .The tone chang in the latter part of the book as the impact of excess focu on individu celebr come at the expens of team perform and the broader valu that sport should promot .In the end , Mr. Futterman is unabl to reconcil these two conflict consider fulli . Money in sport isnt , on it own , a bad thing ,  he insist , but when money becom the motiv goal and purpos in sport , that is a bad thing.In the absenc of a fuller examin of the overarch industri structur , Mr. Futterman can onli offer exhort rather than ani solut : Fan , who have sustain the industri  dont want much  just the abil to enjoy the game they love and the athlet they admir without get rip off , lie to , or insult , either by the athlet who play sport or the peopl who run them.Who could argu with such sentiment ? Although it may not seem like much to ask for , noth in Players suggest that it will be made avail ani time soon .', 'The New York State attorney gener said on Friday that hi offic had open an investig into how toy with danger high level of lead end up for sale at retail includ Target , Kmart and Toy R Us .The attorney gener , Eric T.

Then Detroit file for bankruptci , with $ 18 billion in debt on it book .And there Puerto Rico , which is struggl to make it bond payment  or decid which of it $ 72 billion in municip bond to default on .Still , money ha continu to flow into municip bond , a market domin by individu investor . There have been 27 straight week of inflow into municip bond fund , accord to Dan Heckman , senior fix incom strategist with U.S. Bank wealth manag .The main reason for municip bonds continu strength is that the interest paid on municip bond is free of feder and state tax , which can exceed 50 percent for top earner in state like New York and California . Those save give the bond a substanti advantag over Treasuri bond with similar yield and even higher-yield corpor bond .Still , select municip bond is not as simpl as it wa befor the spate of default chang what wa gener a stodgi asset class .The municip bond market ha transform from what use to be a rate market like Treasuri to a true credit market like the corpor world ,  said John Bonnel , a portfolio manag at USAA .It use to be a given that if the issuer had the abil to pay their debt , they would ,  he said . Now , it their willing to pay that becom more of a focu . Some of these issuer end up with budget situat where they have to pick and choos who go to get paid what.Befor the financi crisi of 2008 and sever high-profil default , municip bond investor reli more on the rate of the bond , someth that an issuer could improv by buy insur on them .What matter wa underli credit qualiti and the issuer , but it got obscur for a long time by municip bond insur ,  said John Bussel , chief invest offic of Hewin Financi Advisor , which manag $ 4 billion for wealthi investor .Shakier issuer would buy municip bond insur to get them a AAA rate ,  Mr. Bussel said . When peopl were buy muni bond from a broker , he would say theyr AAA insured.When the crisi came , the solvenc of municip bond insur wa test , sinc they had also branch out into insur the bond creat out of mortgag . While about 55 percent of municip bond had insur in 2008 , that number is around 6 percent today . And the number of insur ha dwindl to three from seven .Mr. Bonnel at USAA said he would rather have no bond insur , becaus wer do the work ,  ad , Id prefer the issuer didnt pay for the insur and Id have the extra yield.At the moment , shorter-dur municip bond are more in favor than longer-dur bond , even when they pay a quarter of what the longer one do , becaus interest rate are expect to rise and the shorter term all but guarante investor will be paid back .Six month to one-year muni have becom a bigger part of the market ,  said Kimberli Foss , founder of Empyrion Wealth Manag . Today , it about high-qual municip that will be abl to pay the durat of the bond and give peopl the incom they need . What left in their pocket after tax is the most import thing for them.With longer-dur municip bond , the concern is that an increas in interest rate will erod the valu of the invest .The biggest risk is with long bond ,  said Todd M. Morgan , chairman of Bel Air Invest Advisor , which manag $ 3 billion in municip bond . Interest rate are unpredict . They go up 100 basi point ,  or 1 percentag point , and you could lose 20 to 30 percent of your investment.As to determin which municip will not be abl to make their payment for longer-d bond , investor can look to the recent past for a lesson  few of the problem crop up overnight .You may get into fiscal difficulti like a Detroit or a Puerto Rico , but those thing had a long tail and were run out ,  Mr. Heckman of U.S. Bank said . It shouldnt have come as ani surpris that Detroit ran into financi problems.Mr. Bonnel said that investor also need to bear in mind polit chang in the municip themselv .When it come to the willing to pay part , the offici you bought that bond from might be total differ 10 year from now ,  he said . It hard to predict with a 30-year bond.He ad , If it look like thing are deterior and theyr go to have to priorit , hope if youv done your work correctli , youll be out of it by then.The long time horizon show the valu of have someon watch the municip , which is someth that bond manag do but is also a role play by municip bond insur for individu investor .Natali R.

But thi is what happen : They put more than $ 400,000 ( includ all of their retir save ) into a 3,000-square-foot , 102-year-old home in the city West Villag neighborhood that wa most recent apprais at just $ 300,000 .They claim , howev , to be 100 percent satisfi and genuin happi . Which rais a question : Are they insan ?Ms. Haimerl book about their migrat and renov adventur , Detroit Hustl ,  will be out on May 3 . It a love song sung to a hous and a citi , but it also a money memoir , one mark by ignor at the outset and a triumph of feel over financi fact . It doe not end in ruin , but it doe end in debt .So let start with those fact . Ms. Haimerl , who is 40 , and Mr. Kaebnick , 44 , had about $ 10,000 in liquid asset when they decid to move . They settl on a hous on a block where onli two home were board up .They bought the smaller one , a wreck with no wire or radiat or door or pipe , for $ 35,000 , liquid Ms. Haimerl retir account to close without a mortgag . There is essenti noth left insid the wall ,  she write in her book . What we have is a pile of brick with character.For the renov , they were count on the $ 110,000 that would be left from Mr. Kaebnick account . The previou owner had figur it would take $ 150,000 or so to make it habit . What could go wrong ?Well , the coupl wa miss two crucial bit of knowledg , one about the Detroit market and the other about themselv .First , they realiz onli after they had bought the hous that there were no construct loan avail . That wa becaus there wasnt ani evid that after renov , home like their would be worth more than what it would cost to fix them . So whatev work the coupl want to do , they would have to pay for it themselv . Then , they could tri to get a mortgag after the work wa done and take out cash to repay ani other debt they incur along the way .And it turn out that there were a lot of those debt , in part becaus the coupl misjudg the amount of work they would need and want to do . They start by look at option for do just $ 100,000 of work , but that might have forc them to move in without ani water . The onli contractor who made them feel comfort figur it would take $ 300,000 .He went to work , and they end up spend $ 400,000 total , not includ the purchas price . Youv heard version of thi stori befor , but the specif here involv a balconi from a crumbl church that made incred wainscot but beg for match custom woodwork and instal that eventu cost $ 65,000 .So they borrow $ 75,000 from Ms. Haimerl father and $ 40,000 from her grandpar and aunt . Mr. Kaebnick famili chip in with kitchen applianc in lieu of a wed or a gift , and the rest came from a $ 25,000 Lend Club loan , $ 50,000 in USAA person loan and some credit card debt .The result is by no mean extravag , though it is a lot of space for two peopl with no design on have children . The interior trim is bare , and the hous still need paint in mani room . It miss a porch , and the garag out back is crumbl .On paper , Ms. Haimerl is about the last person you would expect to go all in like thi . She grew up poor and lost a hous to a foreclosur in Denver sever year ago , when a previou relationship disintegr . She ha even work as a person financ editor .The money scold in me believ she should have known better , but she believ she know plenti . A a contractor daughter , I grew up with men who want to do it right ,  she said . You dont skimp on work now becaus you pay for it later. So they shore up the roof and rebuilt the rear of the structur .Then , there is her take on retir . Her father had $ 75,000 to lend to her becaus he had been forc to liquid a once-thriv busi that he built after the family earlier lean year . I never grew up with ani idea that there would be retir ,  she said . You were tri not to go to a payday lender . My dad retir wa suppos to be the business.Ms. Haimerl is a writer and Mr. Kaebnick is a comput programm , and perhap they can work well into their 70 or 80 . In the meantim , their net worth is neg . They did get a mortgag after the work wa done , and the apprais assign the $ 300,000 valu to their home , a triumph in their neighborhood at the time .They pull most of that money out in a mortgag to repay mani of their other debt and write a giant check to their contractor , Calvin Garfield . They still owe him about $ 80,000 , but aspir Detroit resid should not expect loos term if they come to town .Im confid other contractor would not have made the same call ,  Mr. Garfield said . But I do think everyon we have done busi with ha becom a friend , and in that mix of thing , thi seem to be the right thing to do.The coupl desper want to repay him , and becaus their incom is just over $ 100,000 , they expect to do so sooner rather than later . Ms. Haimerl freelanc , and they have an Airbnb side busi go use some of that 3,000 squar feet . For just $ 65 a night , aspir Detroit resid can soak up plenti of sober-mind advic and bear wit to the kind of hous that a lot of money and worri can buy .But how best to explain away their lack of retir save ? Plenti of peopl who sank their life save into real estat in less desir part of Brooklyn or San Francisco a decad or two ago are probabl thrill .So is that how they think about the money they have put into their Detroit dream ? That they bet on a citi instead of a bunch of stock ? We have gotten gun-shi about talk that way ,  Ms. Haimerl said . Peopl here say , How dare you treat our citi like an investment.Mr. Kaebnick said he understood the sentiment . So mani peopl who stuck it out here for so long never had anyth to show for it ,  he said . To them , we might come across as privileg newcom who are go to ride it to the bank.In fact , they are true believ who love the citi enough to go all in and then some . Other have found their own way of demonstr their commit to the citi , and at least one of them , Drew Philp , is write hi own book about the hous he bought for $ 500 and fix up without borrow anyth . Hi BuzzFe stori about the experi describ the two winter he had without much , if ani , heat , among mani other unsettl experi .Famili without the mean for $ 400,000 invest or the fortitud to see their breath indoor can buy hous that have electr and run water for half that amount or less . And a new program call Detroit Home Mortgag aim to make it possibl for peopl to get loan befor they start their renov .In the meantim , Ms. Haimerl and Mr. Kaebnick have not found financi freedom in Detroit , though they insist that they are so much richer for have move . In a poignant moment earli in her book , Ms. Haimerl describ gaze longingli into a window in a newli gentrifi Denver neighborhood , befor her dream of homeownership there turn into a nightmar . The live room look like luxuri , a place where the resid werent constantli hustl to hold thing togeth .Aspir homeown in Detroit may well walk down her street someday soon , see her through the window and wonder how she had it so good . Would they be jealou ? Should they be ?I thought mayb that onc you were insid the window , you didnt have to hustl ,  she said . But the truth is , wer all hustling.', 'After a career of work , scrimp and save , mani retire are well prepar financi to stop earn a live .

How do we allow ourselv to be at eas ? How can we be comfort ?  These question lead into an explor of what make us tick and how we can find our best selv .By no mean is thi a seamless transit for most . The rough patch may come earli and often . It hard to break the routin and inertia of a career . You may have to becom a lite version of your career-focus self to bridg the gap .Like mani , Ms. Gee say that her self-esteem and identif were intim link to her work , a common problem with retire seek a new role . Some profession find it unnervingli difficult not to be a banker , doctor , lawyer or engin anymor .The myth of retir is that you have to leav that all behind ,  Mr. Anthoni said . You dont .

Their freelanc statu also let the compani sidestep the cost of full-tim employe , includ pay minimum wage and the employers share of Social Secur . But labor group and lawyer have argu that Uber driver should be classifi as employe to receiv worker protect .On Thursday , Uber move a step closer to get it way . The compani reach a settlement in a pair of class-act lawsuit in California and Massachusett that will let it continu to categor driver in those state as independ contractor  a landmark agreement that could have last implic for the long-term viabil of the ride-hail servic .Under the settlement , file in the Unit State District Court in the Northern District of California , Uber will pay as much as $ 100 million to the roughli 385,000 driver repres in the case . The compani also agre to sever concess to appeas driver concern , includ give more inform on how and whi driver are bar from use the app , as well as aid in creat new driver associations in both state .Importantli , the case is be settl  not decid ,  Shannon Liss-Riordan , the attorney repres the driver in the suit , said in a statement .Thi case , howev , with thi signific payment of money , and attent that ha been drawn to thi issu , stand as a stern warn to compani who play fast and loos with classifi their work forc as independ contractor ,  Ms. Liss-Riordan said .The settlement is a signific victori for Uber on the matter of it drivers statu . By keep it driver as contractor , the San Francisco-bas compani can keep it cost low . And while the settlement appli onli to two state and is nonbind elsewher , the agreement and the chang that Uber is adopt may influenc regul in other place where the issu ha surfac .Driver valu their independ  the freedom to push a button rather than punch a clock , to use Uber and Lyft simultan , to drive most of the week or for just a few hour ,  Travi Kalanick , chief execut of Uber , said in a compani blog post announc the settlement .That said , as Uber ha grown  over 450,000 driver use the app each month here in the U.S.  we havent alway done a good job work with driver ,  he wrote . It time to change.The agreement , which is subject to approv by Judg Edward M. Chen , who is presid over the case , say Uber must pay $ 84 million to the plaintiff repres in the case . Uber will dispens an addit $ 16 million if the compani hold an initi public offer and the averag valuat of Uber increas to one and a half time that of it last financ round . In Decemb 2015 , Uber wa valu at $ 62.5 billion , make it the most valuabl privat technolog compani in the world .The class action that are be settl were origin file in 2013 and becam the biggest suit in term of the number of driver repres . Uber still face litig about driver statu in other state , includ similar lawsuit in Florida , Arizona and Pennsylvania . Last June , the California Labor Commissioner Offic said Barbara Ann Berwick , a former driver for Uber , should have been classifi as an employe , not an independ contractor . That case , which doe not appli to driver other than Ms. Berwick , is be appeal by Uber .The settlement chang are aim at reduc point of content for driver . In the past , Uber ha been abl to boot driver from it platform with littl explan , someth that Uber said it would no longer be abl to do . The compani publish a lengthi document detail all the reason a driver may be deactiv , from unsaf drive and carri a firearm  which is prohibit  to use drug and alcohol .Uber said it would also provid driver with more inform about their rate system  a measur base upon individu score from passeng  and how rate were calcul . The compani is explor creat an appeal process for Uber driver who have been deactiv becaus of a low rate .Uber also agre not to deactiv driver who regularli declin to accept request for ride from passeng , a practic that previous would contribut neg to a driver overal stand with the compani . Instead , driver may be temporarili log out of the app and unabl to accept new request if they are consist not accept trip requests.We know that sometim thing come up that prevent you from accept everi trip request , but not accept dispatch caus delay and degrad the reliabl of the system ,  the compani said in it newli publish driver deactiv polici .Uber penal driver who accept trip from rider and then cancel them shortli thereaft . Each citi will have a maximum cancel rate base on the averag cancel rate of the driver in the area , the compani said . It could eventu deactiv those who persist exceed the rate .Uber said mani of the chang were a part of it overal matur process , as it ha grown from a small start-up to a global organ in roughli six year .Yet mani of the polici chang Uber announc as part of it settlement  particularli chang to it protocol on deactiv driver over their cancel and accept rate  appear design to defus the plaintiffs argument that Uber driver should be classifi as employe rather than independ contractor , as the compani maintain .Thi is Uber relinquish a small amount of control in two area where critic have argu that the Uber-driv relationship look like hire and fire ,  said Seth Harri , a former deputi labor secretari in the Obama administr and co-author of a recent paper argu that Uber driver occupi an ambigu middl ground between contractor and employe .It a tweak of the relationship to move the classif closer to the factor that defin independ contractor and a littl bit further away from factor that defin employee.Other legal expert said that Uber driver would appear to retain mani of the characterist of employe even under the company propos chang .For exampl , the fact that driver whose accept rate are too low could be shut out of the app for short period of time , and that those with unaccept high cancel rate could eventu be deactiv from the platform , may suggest a level of control that is normal reserv for employe rather than contractor .Ultim thi is a deterr to driver actual refus to accept trip ,  said Rachel Bien , an employ lawyer at Outten & Golden LLP who ha litig similar case . If it the kind of busi that need a driver to be at a certain place at a certain time regularli , it not a busi that suitabl for independ contractor , who should have the freedom to choos which job they want to do and when they want to do them.Ms. Bien also point out that unlik what is frequent the case with true contractor , Uber driver will not be abl to negoti the price of the servic they provid custom . They will also continu to be deactiv if their rate from custom are low and dont improv .The propos to creat an associ of driver in California and Massachusett that would meet with compani offici quarterli to discuss issu of import to driver also rais eyebrow in some quarter .If Uber is go to be genuin about thi , I think it a veri , veri good move forward ,  said Joesph Sandov DeWolf , presid of the California App-bas Driver Associ , an organ that claim to repres more than 2,500 ride-shar driver in Southern California .But he express skeptic that thi would be the case , say that whenev the associ ha ask to meet with Uber to discuss drivers concern in recent year , it ha been told that Uber will onli meet with individu driver , not ani associ repres them , which he said wa not effect .', 'DETROIT  SINC go bankrupt in 2009 and need a govern bailout to surviv , Gener Motor ha method rebuilt itself as a profit automak that ha capit on surg sale in the Unit State market .But despit report on Thursday that it first-quart earn had more than doubl from a year ago , G.M . still appar ha a lot to prove to investor .The company stock price hardli budg from it recent level of $ 32 on the news that G.M . earn $ 1.95 billion in the quarter , compar to $ 945 million in the same period in 2015 .Industri analyst have been gener impress by G.M. comeback from it financi problem and it recent safeti crisi over faulti ignit switch link to 124 death .Yet much of the credit for the healthi earn is attribut to the strong market in the Unit State for new car , rather than G.M. improv balanc sheet and new model .Now G.M. , with it domest rival Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler , is push hard to be a major player in the industry high-technolog revolut center on autonom vehicl and electr car .And rather than tri to develop all the technolog itself , G.M . is spend freeli to acquir and work with Silicon Valley compani that can acceler it transform from an old-lin automak into a leader in all aspect of person mobil .They are invest in compani that are further along than they are in new technolog ,  said Karl Brauer , an analyst with Kelley Blue Book .

You dont feel like jump around in a field or do extrem sport . And that O.K.Still , as some of the start-up have found , the topic is still not alway easi to discuss .When Alexandra Friedman and Jordana Kier pitch their idea for a tampon deliveri servic to a potenti investor last year , they found him wari of discuss the intim product .

In the 1990 he wa in open conflict with the music industri , protest the major-label system by write the word slave on hi cheek and chang hi name to an unpronounc glyph .Later , as the music world move onlin , Princ made sometim mystifi pronounc about the Internet , and polic hi music right so care that most of hi song were unavail not onli on jukebox stream servic like Spotifi but also on Pandora and YouTub .Hi move were sometim mock as mere eccentr . But he is now seen as an earli advoc of the kind of experiment and artist control that ha becom an essenti tool of the most forward-think pop star .If you want to see hi influenc , all you have to do is look at what happen today , where you have Kany West releas an album on differ platform and ad to it as he goe along , or Drake say , You know what , Iv got a new record and Im just go to drop it ,  said Jimmi Jam , the produc who wa a longtim associ of Princ , and a former chairman of the Record Academi , the organ that present the Grammi Award .Those type of thing , what the music busi turn into ,  Jimmi Jam ad , a lot of that is directli relat to the artist freedom that Princ wa look for.For Princ , the key wa alway control . Hi battl in the earli 1990 with Warner Bros. , the record compani that had sign him at the begin of hi career , were primarili over the label demand that he releas no more than one album a year , a pace that match the industry market pattern .The restrict rankl Princ , who publicli rebel and eventu start hi own label , NPG Record . In 1996 he releas a tripl album , Emancip ,  through a deal with EMI that allow him to put out album when he wish .The music , for me , doesnt come on a schedul ,  Princ told The New York Time in 1996 . The main idea is not suppos to be , How mani differ way can we sell it ?  That so far away from the true spirit of what music is.Prince last Top 10 hit wa The Most Beauti Girl in the World ,  which went to No . 3 in 1994 . And critic complain that he releas too much music of too littl qualiti . But he continu to break ground .In 2004 , he gave away copi of hi CD Musicology with ticket to hi concert , a strategi that help him move 632,000 copi of the album in five week but also led Billboard to chang it chart rule . In 2007 , copi of hi album Planet Earth were given away in the British newspap The Mail on Sunday ; that year , he also gave an electrifi perform at the Super Bowl halftim show .Around the same time , Princ , who had experi with the onlin world in the 1990 , wa emerg as an appar enemi of the Internet . In 2010 , he told The Mirror , a British newspap , that the Internet complet over ,  for which he wa ridicul onlin . He later clarifi that hi comment wa about money that artist can earn onlin . What I meant wa that the Internet wa over for anyon who want to get paid , and I wa right about that ,  he told The Guardian last year .In recent year , he took full control of hi music right . That includ ownership of hi music publish  the copyright for songwrit  and hi record , which led to a new deal with Warner Bros. in 2014 . ( He told The Associ Press that there were no hard feel : I dont deal in histori nor should they. ) That control let him withdraw hi music from most stream servic , although he left hi catalog on Tidal , the subscript servic bought last year by Jay Z . And like Drake and Mr. West , he made use of platform like SoundCloud to post new track and remov them as he saw fit .For fan , one of the biggest question is what will happen to hi fabl vault of unreleas record . Accord to Jimmi Jam , that materi wa alreadi build by the time of the earli 1980 album Controversy and 1999.If you ever gave him an answer that had anyth to do with becaus that the way we have alway done it ,  that wa absolut the wrong answer to give to Princ ,  Jimmi Jam said . It wa , Whi cant we do it a differ way ? Whi cant we do it better ? ', 'For year , there ha been a limit to the success of American technolog compani in China .

Some have grappl with raid , investig and fine . Some have also been pressur to sell off hold , hand over technolog and work with local partner to expand their China busi .Though Appl is one of the eight , it ha had a much easier time .In 2013 , Appl sign an agreement with China largest wireless carrier , China Mobil , to sell the iPhon in the countri , after six year of woo the carrier . Chines consum spent $ 59 billion on Apple product in the company last fiscal year . Timothi D. Cook , Apple chief execut , ha made multipl visit to China .

Chines lawyer have point out that the country antiterror law requir compani to help with decrypt when the polic or state secur agent demand it for investig or prevent terrorist act .On Tuesday , at a congression hear , Apple gener counsel , Bruce Sewel , said that the Chines govern had ask the compani to share sourc code in the last two year , but that it had refus .The two Appl servic that Chines regul shut down , iTun Movi and the iBook Store , compet directli with Chines Internet companies product . Beij ha recent ad initi to support a sputter economi with new emphasi on industri that requir higher skill and command better profit margin , like the Internet .That push may eventu trickl down to other Appl servic .

Under the new propos , the same bank will have to withhold 60 percent of that pay for four year .The new draft also appli the limit to a broader set of materi risk-takers at big bank , not just top execut .Marcu Stanley , the polici director at the advocaci organ American for Financi Reform , said the new version wa stronger than the 2011 propos , but did not push the bank to go far enough beyond alreadi accept practic .He said , for instanc , that he had hope that bank would have to hold back pay for more than four year becaus big loss on bank invest can often take longer than that to materi .In Britain , by contrast , bank are now forc to hold back some pay for at least seven year . European countri have gener impos stronger restrict on execut compens sinc the financi crisi , includ some hard cap on salari and bonus .The new American rule would appli onli to incentive-bas compens  gener bonus  which vari accord to the perform of the bank and the individu execut .Even without the rule , bank have face steadi pressur from regul and sharehold sinc the financi crisi to chang the way they pay their employe and tie more compens to a firm long-term , rather than short-term , success .JPMorgan Chase , for instanc , recent announc that it wa alter the pay packag of it chief execut , Jami Dimon , so that he is compens primarili with stock that he will receiv onli if the firm achiev certain level of futur profit . Mr. Dimon will get the stock after five year , which is longer than the new rule propos .Bank and other financi institut have gener been cut pay in recent year becaus of their lag perform , and other part of the Dodd-Frank legisl have limit their abil to take big risk and earn the big profit that were common befor the financi crisi .Thi week , Goldman Sach said that the pool of money it had put asid so far thi year for employe compens is 40 percent smaller than it wa at the same time last year .The new rule were debat and describ for the first time at a meet on Thursday of the Nation Credit Union Administr , the first of the six agenc to take up the propos .The public will have until Juli to comment on the new rule , and it will like be month after that befor they go into effect .', 'Think about buy a sport util vehicl or crossov ?

We each had a drink and it wa nice ,  he told me . Just three guys.But , of cours , it wa more than that . It wa about whether they could pull off one of the most intrigu experi in late-night televis histori ; whether Mr. Colbert , who becam a lead voic in American polit satir by play a fiction charact on hi Comedi Central show  hold forth befor a cabl congreg of the convert  could succeed as himself in the big broad tent of network televis , whose commerci and corpor imper can be homogen .CB and Mr. Moonv have hundr of million of dollar ride on the result , not to mention corpor pride . Mr. Colbert ha someth more person on the line : hi reput as a comed actor who use hi longtim perch at Comedi Central to show how integr , grace and wick intellig could inject someth polit power  and power funni  into the late-night lineup of stupid pet trick and vapid celebr interview .He share that reput with hi friend Jon Stewart , who left Comedi Central 11 p.m. Daili Show sever month after Mr. Colbert left hi 11:30 p.m. program , The Colbert Report. In their absenc there ha been a Where is Superman ?  aspect to thi year presidenti campaign , especi in Left America , Centrist-Left America and , ye , Media America .If ever there wa an elect cycl that call for the sharp satir analysi that Mr. Stewart and Mr. Colbert onc provid on a nightli basi , it is thi one . Their successor , Trevor Noah ( The Daili Show ) and Larri Wilmor ( The Nightli Show ) provid their share of edgi satir , but they are rel new and just start to build their follow , just as Samantha Bee is on TBS Full Frontal.John Oliv and Bill Maher have made their mark on HBO , but their show are not nightli , and have not allevi the sens that Mr. Colbert and Mr. Stewart are badli miss in the face of all the Trumpmania . That whi you see headlin such as Call Jon Stewart : America Need You Now More Than Ever ( the liber websit Daili Ko ) or declar like the one made by the former Varieti editor Peter Bart , who said that at the moment of truth  thi elect  Mr. Colbert and Mr. Stewart hid in their foxholes by leav Comedi Central .It pretti odd when you think about it . It like say , No one ha replac Stephen Colbert , not even Stephen Colbert ,  when , in fact , he on televis everi weeknight , just not as the jingoist Conserv talk show host alter ego he employ on Comedi Central .But I found myself feel the same way a few month ago when Donald J. Trump announc hi plan for a total and complete ban on Muslims enter the Unit State after the San Bernardino terrorist attack . I wa curiou to see what Mr. Colbert would make of it .I wa agog when he open the show with three lingeri model from a CB Victoria Secret special that wa to air the next night , wear angel wing and eat hot wing . Even Mr. Colbert appear to blanch at what came off as an exampl of corpor synergi gone awri . Toward the end of the bit Mr. Colbert look at the camera , note that there more stuff on the prompter ,  said someth along the line of The heck with it  but in a way that requir bleep  and cut it short .Mr. Colbert did go on to do a fairli seriou soliloquy about the attack . But it wa hard to squar with the hot wing .CB offici say they didnt forc the Victoria Secret tie-in . But it seem to typifi how a big broadcast will grab what special and cool on cabl and tri press it into the advertiser-friendli , safe-for-broad-audi mold .I sens the same thing in Februari , when Mr. Colbert interview with the actor Casey Affleck , there to promot the movi Tripl 9 ,  turn into a snippi back and forth over Mr. Affleck wardrob . Neither act as if he want to be there for the too-familiar promot exercis .Mr. Colbert ha excel in interview with big polit get , like Vice Presid Joseph Biden and Hous Speaker Paul Ryan , and peopl who genuin interest him , like the energi secretari , Ernest Moniz , who , let face it , is not the sort of A-list televis execut want to see on their flagship late-night show , but is typic of mani guest on The Colbert Report.Of cours Mr. Colbert knew what he sign up for when he took the job David Letterman held for more than two decad . He seem sincer last August when he told GQ he wa eager to shed hi Colbert Report charact . The great ironi is that Mr. Colbert is still learn how to be himself on televis after nine year of pretend to be someon els .Mr. Moonv note that mani late-night host befor Mr. Colbert need time to adjust to the 11:30 time slot . There no way you dont have grow pain ,  Mr. Moonv said , ad that he ha patienc for what he expect to be a long-run show . These thing are gener ,  he ad . To make some adjust after eight month make sens to me , and to Stephen.Thing could be wors . Mr. Colbert still place second in overal audienc  behind Jimmi Fallon on NBC , and ahead of Jimmi Kimmel on ABC . But Mr. Kimmel ha been beat Mr. Colbert among the younger viewer advertis covet . And as Vern Gay of Newsday wrote , Mr. Colbert is lag in the new currenc of viral video share through social media . Beyond that , there is the grow consensu that thing just arent click .Mr. Moonv ha ask Mr. Licht to fix that . Mr. Licht biggest challeng will be redirect a tight and loyal team that came with Mr. Colbert to CB from Comedi Central , and which is known for have an almost religi devot to the star . Mr. Colbert sign off on Mr. Licht appoint onli after an intens three-hour meet over drink at the Parker Meridien hotel bar last month . ( It wa suppos to be secret but they were spot by nation polit report stay there for the New York primari . )Mr. Licht background is in news , not comedi , have come from CB Thi Morn ,  which he gave a new ident and a rate boost . But he appear to be a Colbert kind of guy  for instanc , he made a public pronounc thi year that he wouldnt allow Mr. Trump to do Thi Morning interview by phone .Mr. Licht ha start by take over some mechan of the show that Mr. Colbert wa insist on do himself , so Mr. Colbert can concentr on be himself .Now it up to Mr. Colbert to decid who that is  and for CB to let him .', 'Dish Network want it MTV after all .On Thursday morn , Dish , the satellit TV provid , and Viacom announc that they had struck a multiyear agreement for Dish to continu to carri Viacom bundl of televis network , avert a threaten blackout .Dish 14 million custom will have uninterrupt access to 18 Viacom channel , includ MTV , Nickelodeon and Comedi Central .In addit , select Viacom content will be ad to Dish Sling TV stream servic , which offer a slimmer bundl of network start at $ 20 a month .

And there are mani more faulti car in Europ and elsewher in the world still to be dealt with .Volkswagen ha set asid onli 6.7 billion euro , or $ 7.6 billion , against the eventu global cost from the scandal .If they agre to buy back the car , the cost will be higher than the current provis ,  said Matthia Hellstern , manag director for corpor financ at Moody Investor Servic in Frankfurt .Kevin Helmich , owner of a 2010 Audi A3 with a diesel engin , said on Thursday that he would lean toward have the compani buy hi car back rather than get it repair . Volkswagen is make a real effort to do right by custom ,  said Mr. Helmich , who live in Ann Arbor , Mich . But he ad , I probabl wouldnt buy anoth car from them.Volkswagen face a theoret maximum govern fine of $ 18 billion in the Unit State . Legal expert expect the legal penalti to be much lower , but still in the billion .

Theranos valuat vault to $ 9 billion and put Ms. Holm on the Forb list of billionair .Nearli three year later , with Therano under sieg on multipl regulatori front and it reput in tatter , it clear that the relationship ha been a disast for Walgreen . The compani ha been tri to distanc itself , halt expans of Therano test in it store and , in Januari , threaten to end the partnership if Therano did not meet regulatori standard within 30 day .But that deadlin ha come and gone . With thi week news that Therano is under crimin investig for , among other thing , possibl defraud Walgreen and other investor , the question is : What will it take for Walgreen to end it troubl relationship ?While the legal agreement between Therano and Walgreen isnt public , legal expert said nearli all such contract have a termin claus that anticip someth can go wrong . ( If thi one doesnt , Walgreen would have a good case for su it lawyer for malpractic . )And ani contract can be void if it wa induc by a materi misrepresent  such as Theranos overst the capabl of it nanotechnolog  even if it wa an innoc mistak .Id be shock if Walgreen doesnt have a contractu right to termin the contract right now ,  said Georg Trianti , an expert on contract design and disput resolut at Stanford Law School .Walgreen declin to comment .It easi to see whi Walgreen would have been so infatu with Therano and it revolutionari scientif promis . When the deal wa announc , a news releas trumpet Theranos claim that it kind , minim invas collection technolog use blood drawn from a tini finger stick or microsample would revolution blood test and empow consum , not to mention attract them to Walgreen store .The Wall Street Journal report that Walgreen wa so eager to cement the relationship that it lent Therano money , acquir warrant to buy Therano stock and skip it usual due dilig when evalu a pharmaci partner . The report wa confirm by a person involv in the relationship who spoke on the condit that he not be name becaus of continu investig and the likelihood of litig .Not that Walgreen would have learn much : Therano wa as secret about it technolog with Walgreen as it wa with everyon els .Walgreen eventu open 40 Therano well center in Arizona in a pilot program , and one in Palo Alto , Calif. , close to Theranos headquart .The compani seal their relationship in Novemb 2013 with a ribbon-cut ceremoni at the open of a Therano well center in Scottsdal , Ariz. , attend by Ms. Holm ; Gregori Wasson , chief execut of Walgreen at the time ; and Mayor Greg Stanton of Phoenix . Mr. Stanton , too , jump on the too-good-to-check bandwagon , hail Theranos revolutionari lab test program that make diagnosi of ill fast , inexpens and convenient.Theranos claim that it could run the full gamut of blood test on a microsampl from a finger prick use it own breakthrough technolog prove to be grossli exagger , if not entir fals . At most , Therano perform a few test use such technolog , and recent ha been use tini sampl for onli one out of everi 240 test . The accuraci of even those few test ha been question .Last year , Walgreen said it would halt ani expans of Therano well center in it store . After feder regul warn Therano in Januari that practic at it California lab pose immedi jeopardi to patient health and safeti ,  Walgreen stop Therano test at it locat in Palo Alto and said no patient sampl collect in Arizona could be sent to the California lab .Earlier thi month , feder regul said they plan to revok the licens for Theranos California lab for fail to meet minimum standard and propos ban Ms. Holm from own or run ani lab for two year . Thi week brought news of the crimin investig into whether Therano misl investor .In everi case , Walgreen wa blindsid , the insid told me , learn the bad news from media report or from regul rather than Therano itself . Thi ha hardli endear Therano to it ostens partner director and execut .Therano declin to comment .Walgreen hasnt disclos the amount of it invest in Therano , say onli that it isnt materi . But the reput damag , especi for a drugstor chain tri to reposit itself as a champion of consum health and well-b , ha been consider .It obviou theyd love to get out of thi ,  said Ross Muken , a senior manag director at Evercor , an invest bank , and head of it health care research team . It an unwant distract for a compani that otherwis seem to be on the mend.The Walgreen execut respons for the Therano deal , includ Mr. Wasson , as well as the chief financi offic and the presid of the company pharmaci unit , have all been replac , forc out in 2014 by activist investor after Walgreen acquir the European drugstor chain Allianc Boot . But their departur had littl to do with the ill-fat partnership with Therano , whose troubl becam public after they left .I dont know that you can realli blame them , given how secret Therano ha been ,  Mr. Muken said . Theyr not molecular biologists. Nonetheless , he ad , thi is anoth black mark on what wa alreadi a checker record of deliv for sharehold . Now the new team ha to get out of this.Theranos lawyer have taken a hard line , insist that Walgreen is contractu bound by their agreement . So far , the approach ha work . Walgreen appear to have taken a cautiou approach toward termin the relationship , perhap prefer to wait until feder regul impos penalti or the crimin investig yield formal charg , either of which would strengthen Walgreens hand .But that could take year . Therano can appeal ani penalti , and a grand juri investig could be a protract process . And Therano is like to sue Walgreen in ani event if it termin their agreement .In the meantim , Walgreen risk be drag into nearli everi neg stori about Therano .A host of thing can go wrong in these kind of partnership ,  Professor Trianti said . There are two gener way to deal with the risk : One is to sue for damag if thi happen . But the much better way is to termin the contract and the relationship rather than risk even more damag to reputation.', 'SunEdison , which start out make chemic and compon for solar modul but grew into a giant of renew energi , ha file for bankruptci protect , the compani said on Thursday .

Safra Center for Ethic at Harvard .It did not receiv much notic , but a decis by a feder judg in Massachusett ha reverber loudli through the privat equiti industri .Late last month , Judg Dougla P. Woodlock of the Unit State District Court in Massachusett found that two privat equiti fund were jointli liabl for the pension fund debt of one of the compani they acquir .The privat equiti world is all over thi ,  said Paul Secunda , a labor law and employe benefit expert at Marquett Univers Law School . For everybodi els , it like , what the big deal ? To answer that , it help to go back to the begin of the stori .It start with a Rhode Island compani , Scott Brass , which make brass and copper for all sort of industri . In 2007 , an affili of the privat equiti firm Sun Capit Partner bought Scott Brass , split the ownership between two separ Sun Capit fund .A year later , Scott Brass went bankrupt and stop contribut to it pension fund , run by the New England Teamster and Truck Industri Pension Fund .Feder law impos pension liabil on ani trade or business that is under common control with Scott Brass . The pension fund argu that Sun Capital fund met that definit  and should be liabl for the $ 4.5 million pension fund debt .In 2013 , the Unit State Court of Appeal for the First Circuit found that one of Sun fund did constitut a trade or business  the first time a privat equiti fund wa classifi as such . The appeal court sent the case back to a lower court to decid whether Sun other fund wa a trade or business as well .On March 28 , Judg Woodlock found not onli that the other fund activ met the test of be a trade or busi ,  he also found that the two fund serv as a partnership in fact  one that wa under common control with Scott Brass . That made the fund liabl for the pension debt .What will it mean if the rule is upheld on appeal ?Two year ago , the appeal court opinion drew a flurri of attent over whether the Sun Capit case would challeng the foundat of the privat equiti busi model by chang how it is tax . That becaus the appeal court reli on feder incom tax principl to conclud that Sun privat equiti fund wa a trade or business for the purpos of employe benefit law .In theori , if the I.R. . were to adopt the same reason in a tax context , it could kill the goos that lay the golden egg of the privat equiti industri : it huge tax break . It could do it in a way that would turn the invest world upsid down .And that whi it probabl will not happen , said Gregg D. Polski , a tax law professor at the Univers of North Carolina School of Law who ha written critic about the industry practic .It could creat all sort of potenti headach and uncertainti for investor ,  Professor Polski said , includ foreign investor and tax-exempt investor like univers endow . I dont think the I.R. . is interest in do that.Until now , privat equiti firm have look at compani with underfund pension plan as undervalu target , becaus the privat equiti firm were not respons for fund those plan onc they took over the compani . Now they know they might be if Judg Woodlock rule is upheld on appeal , and if other court adopt it .So , for instanc , take the case of Friendly , which Sun Capit bought , and whose employe pension plan it abandon in bankruptci four year later .Had Judg Woodlock rule been on the book and upheld then , Friendly would have had a differ fate , Professor Secunda of Marquett Univers said .With Friendly , Sun would have been respons for the pension payment themselv  which would have made it not worth do in the first place , I would argu ,  he said .Thi chang the calculu , as far as the peopl who are look at thi as a potenti lucr deal.And in thi particular world , that big news .', 'A steep slide in tradit safe-play stock , like phone compani and util , weigh on Wall Street on Thursday , bring to a close a three-day ralli .The broad declin came as investor pore over compani earn for clue about the trajectori of the economi .Oil price also fell , extend loss for the batter energi sector .Today might be a littl bit of profit-tak after such a big run here ,  said Jeff Kravetz , region invest strategist at U.S. Bank Privat Client Reserv .

But it did not specifi how the compani could prove they had not cheat like Mitsubishi , which ha until April 27 to report back on the affair ; the other carmak have until May 18 .Thi is an extrem seriou matter ,  Yoshihid Suga , the government chief cabinet secretari , said at a daili news brief .

Mr. Schubl wa quot blame low interest rate , which he said hurt German saver , as a factor in the rise of right-w populist parti in the countri . He later said that wa not what he meant .Critic of a certain type could be view as endang the independ of the E.C.B. ,  Mr. Draghi said . Such critic would onli undercut the effect of central bank polici and forc it to do even more , he said .Mr. Draghi fault polit leader for not do enough to improv their economi . If there were also structur reform , the effect of these polici would be quicker ,  he said .Argu that countri had to do more to overhaul their economi and provid fiscal stimulu , he ad , Our monetari polici ha been the onli polici in the last four year to support growth.Mr. Draghi said that an intern central bank studi indic that econom growth from 2016 to 2018 would have been lower if it had not put in place the measur over the past two year , and that inflat would have been neg thi year .At it last monetari polici meet , on March 10 , the central bank surpris economist and investor with an array of move that in some case had never been deploy by a major central bank . Those includ a program that allow bank to draw central bank money for free , and then to receiv a bonu if they lend the money to busi and individu . Bank have to meet certain benchmark to qualifi for the bonu .At the March meet , the central bank cut it benchmark rate to zero from 0.05 percent . It also increas the penalti it charg bank to park money in it vault  a so-cal neg interest rate  to 0.4 percent from 0.3 percent .Mr. Draghi said on Thursday that a program to buy corpor bond , in addit to exist purchas of govern debt , had been expand as announc by the bank last month , with the European Central Bank now buy 80 billion euro , or about $ 90 billion , of bond each month . Known as quantit eas , the purchas are made with newli creat money and are intend as a way to lower market interest rate and increas the amount of money circul in the economi .Some analyst have express concern that the central bank could run short of bond to buy becaus the market suppli is finit .But Mr. Draghi dismiss those concern , say the bank did not see risk of scarcity.Despit the array of measur , inflat in the eurozon ha been stubbornli low . It ha not exceed 0.5 percent in two year and ha fallen below zero on sever occas .The fear is that the eurozon could becom trap in deflat , a viciou downward cycl of fall price that lead peopl to delay purchas in hope of even lower price . The result could be a rise in unemploy as corpor cut cost in the face of fall sale .In the current context , it is crucial to ensur that the veri low inflat environ doe not becom entrench ,  Mr. Draghi said .The central bank polici , he said , had the effect of avoid the second round effects of low inflat filter into wage negoti and the determin of price .Economist have even begun to debat the wisdom of so-cal helicopt money , which would be print by the central bank and hand out to citizen or use to financ public work . Onc consid a radic idea , helicopt money ha becom a more mainstream propos the longer inflat ha resist central bank remedi .But member of the central bank execut board have rule out helicopt money , a posit that Mr. Draghi highlight on Thursday .The concept is fraught with oper , legal and institut difficulti ,  he said . But the bottom line is , we have never discuss it.It would becom veri difficult after that to control expect ,  analyst at Bank of America Merril Lynch said in a note to client on Wednesday . We would also be veri surpris if Draghi had the Govern Council major back to explor thi publicly.', 'Volkswagen is close to complet a deal to resolv claim in the Unit State over it admiss that it rig vehicl to cheat on pollut test , accord to three peopl involv in the case .A deal , if complet , is expect to includ fine from regul and compens to owner that could collect cost Volkswagen billion of dollar . The three peopl spoke on the condit of anonym , cite the continu legal matter .Even at a high price , a settlement would be a major relief to the car compani . The uncertainti over the financi impact of the decept ha delay it earn report and impair it abil to rais money on the market .Judg Charl Breyer of the Unit State District Court in San Francisco had given Volkswagen until Thursday to reach a settlement with the feder govern and with vehicl owner in the Unit State . The judg ha schedul a hear in the case for Thursday morn .The peopl said that the talk had been delic and complex , and that term could chang or the parti might need more time to seal an agreement .The final cost to Volkswagen could be signific .On the regulatori side , Volkswagen face a theoret maximum penalti of $ 18 billion in the Unit State . While lawyer in the case predict the actual fine impos on Volkswagen to be much less , it would still set a record for an automak accus of clean-air violat . The largest compar fine wa $ 100 million impos on the Hyundai-Kia group in 2014 for violat standard on greenhous ga emiss .Ani settlement would also includ provis to fix nearli 600,000 car in the Unit State that are still on the road , seven month after Volkswagen admit cheat on emiss test . Addit , it will most like includ financi incent to ensur that owner bring the car back to dealer to be repair .In some case , Volkswagen will not be abl to fix the car and will have to buy them back from owner . Kelley Blue Book , a research firm , estim the cost of buy back the car in the Unit State at $ 7 billion .Volkswagen may face other expens , too . Thi settlement would appli onli to the 600,000 affect car in the Unit State .

When that happen , the car spew as much as 40 time the allow amount of nitrogen oxid , a pollut that pose health hazard .Judg Breyer is overse all of the litig in the Unit State , includ claim file by feder and state govern as well as Volkswagen owner . Separ suit by Volkswagen dealer and by dealer of compet brand , who say the cheat gave Volkswagen an unfair advantag in the market , would probabl not be part of the initi settlement .Of 11 million Volkswagen vehicl with illeg softwar , an overwhelm major are in Europ . But Volkswagen legal troubl are focus in the Unit State , where limit on nitrogen oxid are more stringent and the penalti more sever .In addit , Unit State law give owner signific scope to seek redress in court . The American owner are seek compens for the declin in the resal valu of their car . The model with the cheat softwar includ Volkswagen , as well as Audi and Porsch car with 2-liter or 3-liter diesel engin from the model year 2008 to 2015 .Germani and most other European countri do not allow class-act suit like those file by Volkswagen owner in the Unit State .

Both side are tri to secur their posit and profit against the backdrop of a rapidli chang televis landscap where rate are in steep declin and cabl and satellit compani are battl against a tide of so-cal cord cutter .Yet thi specif clash is particularli crucial for Viacom .Alreadi , the compani is face signific turbul . There are major concern over it leadership , accentu by a legal battl over the mental compet of it control sharehold , Sumner M. Redston . At the same time , Viacom ha report persist weak earn .The threat that Dish could drop Viacom channel from it servic ha been hang over Viacom for the last sever month . In 2014 , more than 60 small cabl oper , which account for about two million pay televis subscrib in the Unit State , drop Viacom channel , a longtim anchor of cabl TV offer . That stoke fear that larger cabl and satellit compani like Dish might follow their lead .Peopl that have taken Viacom down in the past have done just fine ,  Charl W. Ergen , chief execut of Dish , said in a confer call on Wednesday , hour befor Dish contract to carri Viacom bundl wa set to expir at midnight . Best I can tell , they dont regret the decision.Should the two side fail to reach an agreement , about 14 million Dish custom would experi a blackout of 18 Viacom channel , includ MTV , Nickelodeon and Comedi Central .The disput stem from Viacom want Dish to pay increas , which Dish argu are not justifi given deterior rate at the network as well as the wide avail of Viacom program on stream servic like Hulu and Netflix .

He said that discuss had been more product thi week .There actual probabl is a path to continu carriag , but it not done yet ,  he ad . And obvious , the devil in the details.In a statement Wednesday afternoon , a Viacom spokesman , Jeremi Zweig , said the compani wa hope a deal could be reach , note that it network repres about a fifth of cabl viewership on Dish . Viacom highlight SpongeBob SquareP ,  Lip Sync Battl ,  The Daili Show and Insid Ami Schumer as show that custom would miss .Benjamin Swinburn , an analyst with Morgan Stanley Research , said Dish comment that it would replac Viacom channel with other content suggest that it may not intend to pick those network back up at a later date.Analyst estim that if Dish drop Viacom network perman , Viacom could be forc to make larg cost cut and could experi signific profit declin . Todd Juenger , an analyst with Sanford C.

The smaller cabl compani that drop Viacom network experienc signific subscrib declin .

When she learn how to type quickli and accur , she wa promot to secretari . In the decad sinc , she ha becom one of the most accomplish women in the industri , hold top execut posit at some of the most esteem creativ agenc . She ha been behind numer memor campaign , includ the humanlik M & M ; s charact and Allstate Mayhem ad .But even today , there are male leader in the industri who do not acknowledg her . At industri parti , peopl assum they should be talk to her husband , who is an architect . She tri not to show her emot at work becaus when she doe , she said , I immedi am look at as the crazi woman.I still to thi day , when I feel the blood boil in me and I just want to let it all out , I cut it by 90 percent becaus Im a woman ,  she said .Women now make up almost 50 percent of those work in the advertis industri , includ a rel small number , like Ms. Credl , in top execut posit . Yet when a femal employe of the J. Walter Thompson agenc file a lawsuit in March accus the company chief execut of racist and sexist behavior , the accus brought to the surfac what women in the industri had talk about for year : that more than half a centuri after the Mad Men era , gender bia , while often unspoken or acknowledg , continu to affect how they are treat at work , whom they interact with and what posit they hold .Advertis is far from the onli industri that ha struggl with issu of sexist behavior and gender bia through the year . But in interview with more than a dozen women , mostli execut , who work in advertis , mani said they found it hard to believ how much their particular busi still remain a white man world . Although some women said they had never person experienc gender discrimin and refer to it as a thing of the past , mani said they repeatedli felt ignor or dismiss by male colleagu and left out social . They recal time when they were the onli woman in meet with both co-work and client . Some point to the ad themselv as exampl of how the industry sexism manifest itself beyond offic wall .Ye , there is the rapey talk and the grabbi hand , but it that subtl stuff that chronic and can be more damag ,  said Jean Batthani , the execut creativ director at DDB Chicago .Nanci Hill , a longtim advertis execut who is now presid and chief execut of the 4A , an industri trade group , said that men call her young girl all the time , though she ha been work in the busi for decad .They dont recogn that demean ,  she said .Megan Pagliuca , the global chief execut of Omnicom Accuen agenc , said sexism reveal itself in the preval of social event like golf outing and drink event be use for busi purpos , a sentiment echo by sever other women interview . Women , she said , feel pressur to learn to play golf or to gener act more like their male counterpart or risk miss out on establish import relationship .Do you tri to conform and be like them rather than be yourself , or do you stay strong as who you are and know you are the best oper ?  Ms. Pagliuca said . A challeng for women is make that choice.Ms. Credl , who ha been an execut at the agenc BBDO and Leo Burnett and is now the global chief creativ offic for the agenc FCB , said that the busi meet masquerad as social outing , like when male colleagu go out for steak dinner or watch a sport game togeth from a box suit , have at time made her feel like an outsid , even as she ha becom one of the industry most power creativ execut .But even more damag , Ms. Credl said , is when men ignor her . She recal stand with two men while wait to go onstag at an annual advertis confer in March when anoth man came off the stage . That man , who had just spoken about divers in the industri , acknowledg the two men with her , but didnt bother to look at me ,  she said . I felt invisible.There are time when I experienc thing that I dont think I would have experienc if I werent a woman ,  she said . At the same time , howev , she emphas that mani men in the industri had help her succeed and that for her the bad experi had been rare .Some women also said gender discrimin show up when look at the ad that agenc produc . Mani ad portray stereotyp gender role , they said , with mother in the kitchen , for instanc , and men drive car . Sever women note that onli 11 percent of creativ director are women , a statist from the 3 % Confer , which support femal creativ leadership at agenc .If all the advertis is be creat through that domin male len and you look at what the result is , there a bia in that and there onli one perspect ,  Ms. Batthani of DDB said .There are also more blatant and aggress express of sexism . Sever women describ frequent comment about their appear .Twenty-f percent of women in advertis said they had person experienc gender discrimin , accord to a survey by the 3 % Confer . Twenty-thre percent said they had person experienc or wit sexual harass .In the lawsuit file in March against Gustavo Martinez , the chief execut of J.

She also contend that Mr. Martinez , who ha sinc resign , made numer comment about rape and , on multipl occas , grab Johnson by the throat and by the back of her neck. Mr. Martinez ha deni the alleg against him .There is a lot of sex and drug and rock n roll in the busi  there certainli wa in those day ,  said Rosemari Ryan , a former co-presid of J. Walter Thompson North America who now lead the agenc Co : Collect , refer to her earli career in the 1980 and 1990 . I think there are still some remnant of that.For year , execut have talk about improv divers and get rid of gender bia in advertis , but mani say progress ha been too slow .I think everybodi think it everybodi else problem ,  said Bill Koenigsberg , founder and chief execut of Horizon Media .One reason , some execut said , is that there are current other prioriti in advertis , given the press challeng that stem from a broad shift in how peopl consum media .

Some of those interview declin to provid specif about exampl of gender bia they had seen or experienc becaus they want to protect relationship in the industri .Wendi Clark , the chief execut of DDB North America , said she had felt more subtl discrimin in her career , but acknowledg that , to rise through the rank , she ha block much of it out .The truth is ,  she said , those of us who have made it through  you becom impervi to it in some way.', 'PHOENIX  At the Audiolog Now ! convent here last week , visitor stood next to blow electr fan to experi how a new hear aid could screen out wind nois .

In some case hear assist will be ad to multipurpos product , sometim call hearabl ,  that consum alreadi wear on their ear to listen to music , talk on the phone and even track physic activ .The consum devic are not regul becaus they are not , strictli speak , hear aid but instead are person sound amplif product , or PSAP ( pronounc PEE-sap ) .What set them apart legal is their intend use . They can not be market for hear loss , a medic condit . Rather , accord to draft guidanc issu by the F.D.A . in 2013 , PSAP are for peopl with normal hear who need an extra boost in certain situat , like bird-watch , hunt or listen to a lectur from a distant speaker .But it is almost farcic to pretend that PSAP are be use onli by bird-watch . The F.D.A . is now re-evalu the guidanc .Ira Dolich , 81 , said that when he start have troubl hear student in the colleg market class he taught , he did not consid the problem seriou enough to spend sever thousand dollar for hear aid , especi after hear unfavor review from friend and rel who had done so .So Mr. Dolich , who ha sinc retir and live in Georgetown , Tex. , bought the Soundhawk devic , which he can adjust by himself use hi smartphon .To me it wa a reason invest to experi with ,  he said , ad that he use the devic onli occasion , such as to hear hi wife better when they are in their car .Iv been pretti pleas with it ,  he said .Hear aid manufactur and mani audiologist say consum lack the abil to diagnos and treat hear loss themselv , and might miss seriou diseas . They say that hear aid are tailor for an individu , amplifi differ frequenc by differ amount , a precis not typic avail in PSAP .Amplifi sound is not correct hear loss ,  said Jeffrey Geigel , presid of the American divis of Widex . Mr. Geigel , whose father and grandfath had profound hear loss , said of PSAP , Dont call yourself a hear aid and trick the consumer.Scott Davi , chairman of the Hear Industri Associ , which repres hear aid manufactur , said that two-third of the price of hear aid wa for servic , includ hear evalu , counsel and adjust over the life of the product .Dr. Frank Lin , associ professor of otolaryngolog at John Hopkin Univers , who ha evalu some PSAP , said some cheaper one can overamplifi sound . Some can be frankli danger ,  he said . But some , he said , are be creat by peopl from the hear aid industri and are veri good.A committe of consum electron compani is now tri to develop minimum standard for PSAP . And some audiologist , like Lynn Fireston in Farmington , Conn. , are start to offer PSAP to custom who do not want to pay for hear aid .I think we have to chang and be will to have addit option for patient ,  she said .', 'Dude , where my Pulitz ?When Brian Gleason heard thi week that hi old employ , Sun Newspap of Charlott Harbor , Fla. , had won it first Pulitz Prize , he wa elat .

Now the young men have to keep it from get crush by an anonym slander campaign , overwhelm server and their urg to person respond to thousand of messag from user .The app , call Down to Lunch , is shockingli old-fashion : It all about meet up with your friend in person . You send a messag to some or all of your buddi say that you have free time and are look for compani for a meal , a gym workout , even a church servic . Whoever is interest respond and you arrang to meet .Wer tri to make it feel like you live with your friend again in your freshman dorm ,  said Mr. Viswanathan , a Texa nativ who graduat from Stanford Univers in 2012 with a master in comput scienc .The concept is so simpl that the first version wa built in a day last spring . By last week , Down to Lunch , also known as DTL , wa the No . 1 free social network app for the iPhon and the No . 2 free iPhon app over all . ( It doesnt rank quit as high on Android . )But keep a prime posit on crowd smartphon screen isnt easi . Just ask Foursquar , which debut with a splash in 2009 but ha drift into near irrelev , or Yo , an app that let you send the word yo to your friend , which momentarili top the chart in 2014 .Mr. Viswanathan , a mile-a-minut talker , and Mr. Lau , who is more laid-back , meet one fundament requir for success : a stubborn belief that they have a great idea . Mr. Viswanathan work on five previou servic that tri to connect peopl , three of them with Mr. Lau , but Down to Lunch wa the first to catch on .The San Francisco start-up ha need littl capit so far , and the founder have turn away dozen of potenti investor . Howev , the men , both Stanford alumni , have not been shi about seek advic from their array of Silicon Valley connect , includ senior tech execut , ventur capitalist and other compani founder .As thousand of app develop have discov , attent span are short , especi among the colleg and high school student that Down to Lunch is target . Dozen of competitor are vy to help peopl organ spontan gather , includ Hangster , Shortnotic , Down to Hang and a Googl app call Who Down .And a lot of thing can go wrong on the road to becom the next Snapchat .Down to Lunch server went down last week after hit limit impos by their cloud comput provid , forc the start-up to devis a work-around . A human error derail sign-up for six hour on Monday .In addit to typic start-up problem  lack of sleep , inadequ staf , technic malfunct  Mr. Viswanathan and Mr. Lau have also been battl an anonym social media campaign claim that Down to Lunch is use for sex traffick .The assert , some describ encount with suspici stranger , are dubiou . Down to Lunch is design to allow commun onli between peopl who know each other and have each other phone number .Kirsta Melton , who head the human traffick divis of the Texa attorney general offic , said that she look into the app and found no evid support the alleg .Unless you have random stranger in your address book or someon stole your phone , it unlik that thi app could be use for human traffick ,  she said .It not clear who is behind the smear campaign , although Mr. Viswanathan and Mr. Lau believ it might be a competitor . They trace the accus back to sever Twitter account . Twitter temporarili suspend one account and appear to have block offend tweet from other . Appl and Googl have also remov app-stor review that mention the traffick alleg .But that ha not stop worri user from contact Mr. Viswanathan or Mr. Lau or simpli delet the app . Mr. Viswanathan said one school administr even call him about it .Despit the damag the traffick accus have caus , there is no question that Down to Lunch ha struck a chord with young peopl . After the app appear on the Univers of Notr Dame campu , for exampl , 15 percent of the student bodi download it within 12 hour , Mr. Viswanathan said .Aakash Malhotra , a freshman at the Univers of Georgia who download the app last Septemb , said it help him build friendship on campu . We have enough app on our phone that give us inform or entertain us ,  he said . Wed rather have an app to help us connect in person.Until Februari , Mr. Viswanathan and Mr. Lau were the onli employe . The six-person compani still oper from the loft-styl apart that the founder share in San Francisco South of Market neighborhood .Whiteboard cover one wall , lay out the top task for the day and week . Mash note from fan are post as inspir . Leaki takeout contain have colon the kitchen , and Mr. Lau often stash McDonald breakfast burrito in the refriger to fuel marathon code session .Mr. Viswanathan , 28 , intern at Microsoft , Googl and Facebook , where he sat right outsid the glass-wal offic of Mark Zuckerberg , the co-found and chief execut , and occasion play chess with him .Mr. Lau , 26 , wa an engin intern at LinkedIn . When the job wound down , LinkedIn chairman and co-found , Reid Hoffman , person implor him to stay . Mr. Lau declin and later went to Pinterest .While the pair ha not been shi about tap their network for help , they have eschew most of the usual market tactic for a start-up .They have avoid public , refus most interview request . When Product Hunt , a servic that highlight new app , open a discuss about Down to Lunch two month ago , Mr. Viswanathan quickli post a note say , Haha what how is thi on product hunt  can we take thi down ? And in an industri where an invest from a top ventur capitalist confer immedi credibl , theyv been push everyon away , even the who who of invest ,  said Cameron Teitelman , the chief execut of StartX , a nonprofit for Stanford entrepreneur that ha help the compani .Mr. Lau explain , If we take time out to rais money , that time wer not work on the product . That time that user cant talk to us . That time that wer not keep server up.The founder and their small team have instead focus on improv the app . When they have a new version to test , they drive across the Bay Bridg to the Univers of California , Berkeley , to get feedback from student .They tri to respond person to the thousand of messag they get from user everi week . At one point , Mr. Viswanathan wa get so mani text that hi iPhone messag app froze . The problem stump even Apple V.I.P . support team , which got involv after Mr. Viswanathan email Apple chief execut , Timothi D. Cook , for help .The founder are also wrestl with a question face by develop everywher : How hard do you push your user to recruit friend to download your app ?Last week , they ad a button that allow peopl to invit all of their contact with one click . But mani peopl consid such request to be spam , and Twitter wa alreadi fill with complaint from peopl who receiv unwant Down to Lunch invit .After a coupl of day , the pair decid to disabl the mass-invit featur .Although their live are stress , the founder say they are have a blast .We know we can build someth that improv the live for everi singl person on the planet ,  Mr. Viswanathan said . It sound kind of crazi , but wer go to do it.', 'The news that the blood-test compani Therano is be investig by the Justic Depart and the Secur and Exchang Commiss bring to mind the adag that if someth sound too good to be true , it probabl is .The compani , which seem to epitom a Silicon Valley unicorn by shoot to a valuat of $ 9 billion on the promis of revolutionari technolog , make a billionair of it founder , Elizabeth Holm , could find itself swamp as it deal with the investig and problem in it laboratori .Therano say it i cooper fulli with all investigations.The question is what potenti violat might be the subject of the investig .Like most privat compani , Therano share have not been made avail to the gener invest public . But that doe not exempt the compani from the anti-fraud provis of the feder secur law . A misstat or omiss of materi fact in connect with the sale of it secur to ventur capit firm could constitut a violat .One might expect that the sophist investor in Silicon Valley would not be dupe by the project and market predict made by a start-up like Therano . But the issu could be one about the viabil of the company claim about it scientif methodolog and result , an area where most investor would have littl abil to scrutin .In a speech on March 31 , Mari Jo White , the chairwoman of the S.E.C. , rais question about the rocket valuat of start-up , point out how these compani may succumb to the same pressur as corpor whose share are publicli trade to push their valuat as high as possibl .The concern is whether the prestig associ with reach a sky-high valuat fast drive compani to tri to appear more valuabl than they actual are ,  she said .That may well signal one area of concern about Therano .The compani undoubtedli had hefti disclosur about the risk and potenti of it technolog when it sought ventur capit fund . And it may well be that Ms. Holmes technolog work  we just dont know yet .Secur violat can be the subject of both a civil enforc action by the S.E.C . and crimin prosecut by the Justic Depart . Compani have to handl inquiri care becaus of the risk of a hefti crimin fine on top of disgorg of fund rais through mislead solicit of invest .A potenti area of inquiri for feder prosecutor is the relationship between Therano and the drugstor chain Walgreen , which agre to make the company equip avail in some of it store . Ani decept regard the efficaci of it test , especi if consum were misl , could lead to charg under the feder mail and wire fraud statut .Anoth avenu for possibl scrutini by crimin investig is the file that Therano made with the Food and Drug Administr to obtain approv for use of it blood-test equip . An incomplet or mislead disclosur in an applic to the agenc could be prosecut under the law that make it a crime to submit ani materi fals , fictiti , or fraudul statement or representation to a feder agenc .As the investig delv into the compani , an import issu will be whether ani individu are singl out for possibl prosecut and civil penalti . The Center for Medicar and Medicaid Servic threaten to close Theranos laboratori in California and bar Ms. Holm and the company presid , Ramesh Balwani , from own or oper it lab for two year .The Justic Depart ha emphas that a compani must identifi individu respons for wrongdo to receiv ani credit for it cooper . That will put a premium on inform that can help the govern pursu charg against peopl insid Therano .As the compani deal with the investig by the Justic Depart and the S.E.C. , the question aris about who will undertak ani intern inquiri . The company defens ha been led in recent month by David Boi , a founder and the chairman of Boi Schiller & Flexner and , most recent , it newest director .As the Deal Professor note in Februari , thi put Mr. Boi in a ticklish situat becaus of the potenti conflict of interest between hi role as counsel to the compani and as one of it director .Prosecutor and regul reli heavili on compani to conduct an initi investig and report the result . But if it look as if the lawyer conduct the inquiri have a conflict of interest , ani credibl the investig might have can be undermin by question about it independ . That can lead investig to dig into an organ on their own , rummag through corpor record and demand to speak with employe and execut rather than allow the compani to control at least the preliminari stage of an investig .An interest sign of how Therano will respond to the Justic Depart and S.E.C . investig will be who is chosen to overse the intern inquiri , an expect step in ani effort to demonstr cooper .The feder investig prompt anoth question : Whi arent the ventur capit firm that invest in Therano su ? After all , if Therano were a public compani , there would be a slew of lawsuit claim that sharehold were defraud . One reason may be that there is no basi to make such a claim . Investor either still believ in Theranos blood-test devic or they receiv truth disclosur about the state of that technolog and the risk of invest in the compani .Anoth explan may simpli be that Theranos investor are too embarrass to make such a claim . In the feed frenzi that led to Theranos $ 9 billion valuat , some ventur capitalist may not have done their due dilig , and they may not want to admit to their own investor that they were either foolish or dupe . Thi is probabl go to be a more common problem in Silicon Valley as sky-high valuat start to fall back to earth .', 'Younger adult are among those hardest hit by bank overdraft fee , a new report from the Pew Charit Trust that wa releas on Wednesday said .More than a third of heavy overdraft user  those who pay $ 100 or more in bank fee in a year for overdraw their bank account  are in their late teen through earli 30 , Pew found .One reason younger consum may be more affect is that they are more like to use debit card , and debit make up the major of transact result in overdraft fee , said Joy Hackenbracht , a research offic with Pew .Frequent overdraft are a financi burden ,  she said .Mani bank let custom overspend their check account when they do not have enough money to cover a purchas , but then charg a fee  typic $ 35  known as an overdraft fee .A small proport of custom pay the major of overdraft fee , Pew found , and they pay more than three such fee a year . The typic debit transact amount that result in an overdraft fee is $ 24 .These custom are essenti use the overdraft option not just as an occasion courtesi , but as an expens form of short-term credit , Pew found . It also riskier credit , Pew said , becaus unlik with other loan , bank do not have to verifi if a consum ha the financi abil to repay the debt , and consum do not have to be given a reason time to repay it .Even if some consum knowingli use overdraft as a form of credit , the practic should come with the protect that go with other type of loan , said Susan K. Weinstock , director of consum bank at Pew .For instanc , she said , bank should have to disclos the effect annual percentag rate on the overdraft protect , which can be quit high .The find come from a Pew-commiss telephon survey of 304 heavi overdraft user in late 2014 . ( Social Scienc Research Solut screen more than 8,400 peopl to find the particip . ) The margin of sampl error is plu or minu 7 percentag point .In 2015 , 628 larg bank that are requir to report overdraft and insuffici fund fee said the charg total $ 11.16 billion in revenu , or almost two-third of all the report banks fee revenu from consum deposit account , the Consum Financi Protect Bureau said .Younger consum , includ those on colleg campus , may be more vulner to overdraft fee becaus mani are manag their financ independ for the first time , said Christin Lindstrom , director of the higher educ program of the Unit State Public Interest Research Group , an advocaci organ .Colleg student often open new account to receiv their financi aid refunds  money left over after the institut deduct tuition and other cost  and may be caught off guard when the account charg overdraft fee , she said .Colleg often hire outsid compani to distribut student financi aid , and the compani promot their own debit card as a conveni way for student to receiv money .The Depart of Educ last year adopt rule ban the charg of overdraft fee on account use for student aid . The rule take effect in Juli , so they will be in place for the academ year start in the fall .The rule , howev , do not appli to other campus-affili bank account that are not directli involv in the distribut of student financi aid . Student should shop around for bank servic , rather than just use those promot by their school , said Deborah Goldstein , execut vice presid at the Center for Respons Lend .There might be better account avail ,  she said .The Consum Financi Protect Bureau ha been scrutin bank overdraft practic . Pew report urg the agenc to adopt rule to make sure overdraft program are use for infrequ and accidental occurr .Pew suggest includ a requir that penalti be in proport to the amount that caus the overdraft or to the bank cost in cover the transact . Pew also suggest cap the number of overdraft fee to six small fee a year ; ani fee over the cap should be cover by rule that govern other type of credit .Here are some question and answer about overdraft fee : Am I requir to have overdraft protect on my check account ?No . Custom must opt in to receiv overdraft coverag . If you are get overdraft fee and do not want to pay them , contact your bank to stop the servic . Be awar that ani debit transact that exceed your balanc will be declin .While have overdraft coverag is voluntari , consum often misunderstand their option , said Ms. Weinstock at Pew . Thi is , in part , becaus bank do not alway explain the choic clearli . There a lot of confus ,  she said .Pew previou research found that mani peopl who were charg overdraft fee did not recal choos coverag . Is there a way to keep some overdraft protect , yet minim fee ?You can often choos an overdraft transfer option , which will move money from a link save account into a check account , when need , to cover a debit transact . There may still be a transfer fee , but it is often much less than a typic overdraft fee . How can I avoid overdraft fee ?Consum should make use of an account automat notif option , which send text or email alert when the balanc fall below a certain level . It veri import to pay attent to your balanc ,  said Ms. Goldstein at the Center for Respons Lend .She also suggest look for a bank or credit union that offer account without overdraft servic .

So he took the devic home and made it hi everyday mobil companion , much as one would adopt an abandon anim on it way to be euthan .That how I think about a lot of my tech stuff : candid for 11th-hour pet rescu ,  said Mr. Lai , ad that he wa fire from the recycl facil in 2010 after continu to take home unwant gadget , against the wish of hi boss . Now he work for the Fixer Collect , a social club in New York that repair age devic to extend their live .Mani tech compani are tri to train peopl to constantli upgrad their gadget  part way with a devic , the argument goe , as soon as someth newer and faster come along . Compani like Appl , AT & T ; and T-Mobil USA now offer earli upgrad plan that allow consum to buy a new cellphon everi year . Philip W. Schiller , Apple senior vice presid for worldwid market , said at a product event last month that it wa realli sad that more than 600 million comput in use today are more than five year old .Mr. Lai behavior might be extrem , but hi experi with the Palm Treo illustr there is anoth way : If you simpli put some mainten into electron as you would a car , you can stay happi with your gadget for year .It is part of a movement of anti-consumer , or the notion of cherish what you have rather than incessantli buy new stuff . Sign of thi philosophi are spread : Industri data suggest that consum are wait longer to upgrad to new phone than they have in the past .So in observ of Earth Day on Friday , Mr. Lai and Kyle Wien , the chief execut of iFixit , a compani that provid instruct manual and compon for repair devic , offer their advic on get the most mileag out of a smartphon , tablet and comput .When smartphon and tablet were fairli sluggish and limit in abil compar with comput , there wa a compel reason to buy a new mobil devic everi few year . But now the mobil gadget have becom so fast and capabl that you can easili keep them much longer .A five-year-old comput is still complet fine now ,  Mr. Wien said . Wer start to hit that same plateau with phone now.Maintain smartphon and tablet is fairli easi . Just two critic featur requir attent : data storag and batteri capac . If a devic is close to run out of storag , the oper system may slow to a crawl . And if the batteri is near the end of it life cycl , the devic will run out of juic more quickli than it onc did .So how do you free space ? For Android phone and tablet , Mr. Lai recommend store person data like photo , movi and download file on a remov memori card . That will open up room on the device intern storag , allow the Android system to run more quickli .On Apple iPhon and iPad , which lack support for remov memori card , manag storag can take more sleuth . One clever tip recommend recent by a user on Reddit.com wa to rent a movi on iTun that exce the amount of space you have left . When the devic detect it lack room for the movi file , it reject the download and clear out cach data linger in app . I test thi method by download the new Star War movi on a three-year-old iPad that wa nearli out of space ; it freed two gigabyt and sped the tablet significantli .If you have tri those tip and are still struggl with storag , consid delet app you rare use or back up all your data , reinstal the phone oper system and instal as few app as possibl , Mr. Wien said .Then there is the batteri . Everi mobil batteri ha a maximum number of cycl , or number of time it can be deplet and recharg , befor it can no longer hold a charg . On an iPhon or iPad , you can check the number of use cycl by plug the devic into a Mac and run the free app coconutBatteri , which reveal batteri statist .In my test , the coconutBatteri app reveal that my 18-month-old iPhon batteri had gone through 610 charg cycl ; Apple websit say the batteri lose about 20 percent of it origin capac after 500 charg cycl . In other word , in about six month I should consid replac the batteri .For Android devic , the free app Batteri by MacroPinch can tell you the gener health of your batteri .A rule of thumb is to replac your smartphon batteri everi two year , and to upgrad your tablet batteri everi four or five year , Mr. Wien said . A new batteri will cost $ 20 to $ 40 , depend on the phone . Mani Android smartphon have remov batteri that can be chang by remov the back cover ; step for replac iPhon batteri can be found on repair site like iFixit .In gener , PC have becom so fast and robust that even a five- to seven-year-old comput today can feel modern with a bit of mainten . And as a bonu , it is easier to remov and upgrad comput part than mobil devic part .Mr. Wien and Mr. Lai strongli encourag peopl to swap tradit hard disk drive for a newer storag technolog call solid state . Solid-st drive gener have less storag capac than spin hard-disk drive , but they load applic faster and are more durabl becaus they lack move part .Anoth comput compon that can be upgrad easili is memori , commonli call RAM , for random access memori . The more RAM you have , the more program you can open and the more quickli your comput can juggl multipl applic . Mr. Wien and Mr. Lai recommend instal the maximum amount of memori that your comput support to speed thing up .For top mainten , bewar of a culprit that surround all of us : dust . The dust that collect in a machin gener heat , which will acceler a PC age process . You would do your comput a big favor by spend a few dollar on a can of dust-remov spray and blow out dust from it air vent and fan everi few month .For laptop , note the amount of storag and batteri capac that remain . Apple websit show inform about the maximum number of batteri cycl for each MacBook batteri . You can see the number of cycl the batteri ha complet with coconutBatteri . For Window comput , the app Batteri Infoview will show the health of the batteri .IFixit offer instruct for replac batteri , instal drive or ad memori to Appl , Window and Android devic  but you wouldnt be alon if you froze in fear after read all the step . You could alway use compani support servic , like Apple batteri replac program , or the Best Buy Geek Squad , or hire an independ fixer .Fixer are gener easi to find on site like Yelp . Just make sure you pick a reput one who use good part . J. D. Biersdorf , a consum tech writer for The New York Time , profil sever repair servic last year , includ NYC iPod Doctor , which offer a mail-in program for repair laptop and Appl devic .A phone can last for a veri , veri long time if your need arent extraordinari and if you take care of it ,  Mr. Lai said . Recent some of the key on hi Treo keyboard gave out , so he put tini piec of electr tape over them . Now he just press them a littl harder to get them to work .', 'For a year and a half , Halliburton and Baker Hugh , two big oil field servic compani , had been focus on their $ 35 billion merger .

That left the compani with littl will to fight .What Halliburton may have miscalcul here is the sever of the downturn and certainli the appetit of the Depart of Justic to flex it muscl in a larg corpor merger ,  said Matt Marietta , an analyst at Stephen Inc .As compens for the breakup , Halliburton agre to pay Baker Hugh $ 3.5 billion by May 4 , accord to Sunday statement . It is a lofti price , especi when cash flow is tight in the energi industri .That high fee wa necessari becaus the deal almost did not happen two year ago . The two compani struggl initi , in the fall of 2014 , to find a suitabl price and breakup fee . But then , Halliburton threaten to turn over Baker Hughes board to restart discuss . The plan work , with Halliburton rais it bid and agre to a larger-than-averag fee if the deal were to fail to win regulatori approv . At the time , the fee wa a symbol commit from Halliburton to do whatev it took to make sure the deal clear the Justic Depart .As stand-alon compani , though , analyst say both Halliburton and Baker Hugh should be abl to surviv . Halliburton ha about $ 10 billion of cash on it balanc sheet that it could use toward the breakup fee or potenti other transact , accord to data by S & P ; Capit IQ .I dont see a risk of either of the compani be bankruptci risk ,  Mr. Marietta said . I think both compani are well posit to manag through the downturn.Share of both compani have surg about 20 percent each sinc the Justic Department lawsuit wa disclos on April 6 . For mani investor , the lawsuit wa a way of dissip the cloud of uncertainti that had cover the deal for 18 month .The move by the Justic Depart wa the latest tough stanc from an administr that ha been seen as take more aggress action against larg deal . The previou one wa Pfizer attempt $ 152 billion merger with Allergan , which wa termin after the Treasuri Depart came out with new tax-rel rule that elimin mani of the benefit of the deal .The European Commiss , the European Union execut bodi , also rais concern about the Halliburton-Bak Hugh deal .The transact rais competit concern on a veri larg number of market relat to oil field servic provid to oil and ga explor and product companies in Europ , Margreth Vestag , the European Union competit commission , said in a statement .She said that a number of custom contact us to rais issu with the propos transaction.The date by which Halliburton and Baker Hugh would have to decid whether to continu on their path of regulatori approv or termin their merger agreement wa extend to April 30 . As a result , Halliburton postpon it earn call to Tuesday , which mani analyst assum wa done to discuss the deal .Sinc the downturn start at the end of 2014 , Halliburton ha reduc it head count by about a third , the compani said in it April 22 earn statement .

The littl pilotless fli machin typic carri camera , GP sensor and other devic that can tell interest parti where they have been and what they have seen . How much of that inform should be share with local govern ?That question is especi import in China , where regul have look askanc at drone while tighten their hold over civil societi .In a brief for Chines and foreign journalist at DJI headquart in Shenzhen on Wednesday , Zhang Fanxi , a spokesman for the compani , said it wa still work out how to deal with the data it collect in China . But for now , he said , DJI is compli with request from the Chines govern to hand over data .Adam Najberg , anoth DJI spokesman , said DJI evalu each request and compli if it decid that request wa legitim .DJI could also give the govern data from flight in Hong Kong , Mr. Zhang said . That could rais eyebrow among drone user in the citi , a semiautonom Chines territori with it own law that guarante freedom of express and it own independ judici system . Protest in Hong Kong that shut down part of the citi in late 2014 were prompt in part by concern that Beij wa interf in local affair .For the moment , Mr. Zhang said , DJI wa uncertain what the industri would decid to do with the data . Thi data , exactli how we use it , when we use it and which govern depart we give it to is a continu discuss , he said .DJI also sell drone in the Unit State . Mr. Najberg said DJI did not have a way to see video or imag from drone beyond those that user upload themselv via a compani social-media app . He also said that the company phone app upload flight data to it server , though consum can use third-parti app that do not .DJI is not alon in cooper with Chines author when they request data , which is requir of all compani do busi there . In it most recent report on govern request for inform , Appl said it receiv about 1,000 request for data in the second half of last year from Chines author and suppli data about two-third of the time . Appl said thi week that it had never hand encrypt key over to the Chines author , which would give Beij direct and broad access to commun on Apple product .( Over the same period , Appl receiv about 4,000 request from the Unit State author and hand over data four-fifth of the time , accord to it report . Access to encrypt commun on Appl devic ha becom the subject of a fierc American polit debat . )But China ha been seek more way to tap into electron commun . Two year ago , it propos a law that would requir foreign compani to turn over encrypt key for secur reason , though the final version drop that languag . Offici have cite rise onlin crime in China , worri about terrorist attack and disclosur by Edward J. Snowden , the former Unit State govern contractor who reveal that American intellig agenc sometim use American technolog product to gather inform .Mr. Zhang said DJI did not give Chines author direct access to drone unless request . If the govern say it want thi data , we will tell the user ,  he said . We commun all of this.Still , China ha not formal rule over drone , so the industry oblig are unclear .Alreadi , DJI user agreement flag the possibl that whoever fli a drone may not be fli it alon . It read : Pleas note that if you conduct your flight in certain countri , your flight data might be monitor and provid to the govern author accord to local regulatori laws.In other area , relat with Beij remain untest . The compani ha had numer request from local govern in China to work with and train the militari polic and other secur forc to use it drone for surveil and to track crimin , Mr. Zhang said .Still , drone face a skeptic audienc here . In 2013 , Chines forc shot down a drone over a Beij suburb . Sever month later , a foreign who took breathtak shot of central Beij with a DJI drone earn a brief detent and a stern talking-to .Drone have rais secur concern in the Unit State as well , after one crash on the White Hous lawn last year .

The compani acknowledg that it engin had intent manipul evalu .The cheat affect about 620,000 car sold in the Japanes market start in 2013 , Tetsuro Aikawa , Mitsubishi presid , said at a news confer .But the problem could stretch beyond that make of car . Mr. Aikawa said that the same test method , which wa in violat of Japanes standard , wa use on other model in the countri and that Mitsubishi wa investig whether fuel-economi rate for other line had been exagger as a result .It ha becom clear that improp test method were use to improv the appear of fuel effici ,  Mr. Aikawa said befor he and other compani leader bow in apolog . Compani execut call the manipul of test on the microcar , call the eK , intentional.Automakers report of fuel economi and pollut rate have come under especi close scrutini after a scandal at Volkswagen last year . The German automak wa found to have manipul softwar in 11 million diesel vehicl to cheat on emiss test .Mitsubishi reput ha been batter by scandal befor . In 2000 , the compani admit that it had been hide report on vehicl defect for more than two decad . The news contribut to a sale plung of nearli 50 percent and nearli push the automak into bankruptci .The revel of cheat put the fuel rate of other Mitsubishi vehicl under scrutini . It share fell 15 percent on Wednesday after the compani releas a brief statement say it had engag in improper fuel-economi report . It disclos the detail after the market close .The cheat at Mitsubishi appear to have been expos by an unexpect sourc : anoth Japanes carmak , Nissan Motor .Mitsubishi manufactur the eK and sell it at dealership in Japan . But it also suppli version of the car to Nissan , which market them under a differ name , the Dayz . Nissan , a larger compani with a more extens dealer network , actual sell more of the vehicl than Mitsubishi doe .Such arrang are increasingli common in the global auto industri , as manufactur pursu greater scale in an effort to lower cost . And for smaller manufactur like Mitsubishi , whose sale of 1.2 million vehicl a year make it onli the sixth-biggest carmak in Japan , they can be financi indispens .Nissan took over develop and design work on the eK and Dayz last year . It wa then , Mr. Aikawa said , that Nissan engin notic the discrep in the publish fuel rate  ostens an impress 25 to 30 kilomet per liter , or 60 to 70 mile per gallon , depend on the version  and confront Mitsubishi . He said the compani would pay compens to Nissan ; the amount is subject to negoti .Mr. Aikawa said he and other top execut were unawar of the manipul until it wa point out by Nissan , at which point Mitsubishi began an intern investig . It remain unclear who order the cheat , he said , but Mitsubishi plan to ask an independ commiss of expert to conduct a more thorough inquiri .We had problem in the past , and we thought that we had overcom them as an organ , but that wasnt the case ,  said Ryugo Nakao , a Mitsubishi execut vice presid in charg of product develop .The car is a kei ,  a categori of tini vehicl with engin under 660 cubic centimet  smaller and less power than mani motorcycl  that is specif to Japan . Subject to lower tax than full-siz car , kei were introduc in the lean year after World War II to promot car ownership , and they remain popular with budget-consci buyer .The manipul of the eK fuel rate involv the way Mitsubishi calcul the effect of wind and tire resist dure simul . Resist fluctuat , depend on a car speed and other condit , and maker are suppos to oper test vehicl in a way that produc an averag over the cours of a test . That , presum , give a result closer to real-world condit .But Mitsubishi said it had secretli use a test method that can produc lower resist and can make the vehicl appear to travel farther on less fuel . It said that it had use the same method on an unspecifi number of other model , and that it wa examin test result date to 2002 to determin if they were faulti .The Ministri of Land , Infrastructur , Transport and Tourism , which regul the automobil industri , said the method Mitsubishi use differ from Japan nation mandat standard .Mani countri , includ the Unit State , set their own detail rule for fuel-economi test , and Mr. Nakao said Mitsubishi , like other carmak , test the car it make for export with method differ from those use on car it sell in Japan . But he said Mitsubishi would also review the fuel-economi standard it had report oversea for possibl discrep .Mr. Nakao said the method that Mitsubishi use to calcul resist wa similar to the standard use in the Unit State . The Unit State and Japan both conduct their fuel-economi test in a laboratori set , use a devic call a dynamomet in which the car wheel rest on larg roller that can simul drive uphil or other road condit .The Unit State test involv drive at higher speed and with harder acceler to mimic Interst drive , said Ryan Harti , an environment project manag at American Honda in Torranc , Calif. As a result , offici gas-mileag rate in Japan are usual higher than those determin by the Environment Protect Agenc , he said .The result in Japan come out quit high , and custom know that and accept it ,  Mr. Harti said . U. . custom want to get the same mileag as the number on the window sticker.Mitsubishi admiss is the latest blow to the credibl of automak , said Michel Kreb , a senior analyst at AutoTrad .Thi ha left a cloud over the auto industri that suggest it isnt honest ,  Ms. Kreb said . It lead consum and regul to be suspicious.Volkswagen is still reel after it acknowledg in Septemb that it had equip million of car worldwid with softwar intend to cheat on tailpip emiss test . The vehicl spew far more pollut than allow under feder standard .Sinc 2012 , Hyundai , Kia , Ford and the Mini divis of BMW have all been forc by Unit State regul to lower their fuel-economi rate for variou line .

Ford paid up to $ 1,050 each to about 200,000 owner of six differ model , most of them hybrid , that had been sold with inflat mileag rate .Ms. Kreb said the willing to take shortcut reflect difficulti that automak face as they strive to meet new standard for emiss and fuel economi that regul in Europ , the Unit State and elsewher have set .There intens pressur to reach these standard ,  she said , and some are do it by not actual have the perform to back it up.', 'LONDON  Barclay announc on Wednesday that a veteran of it Barclaycard busi would be the perman head of it credit card and payment oper .Amer Saje , who join Barclay from Citigroup in 2006 , becom chief execut of the Barclaycard busi immedi , the British bank said .Iv been impress by Amer deep understand of the global payment landscap ,  Jame E.

In do so , regul brought particular scrutini to Google relationship with some of the world biggest cellphon maker , which have help expand the reach of Android .Margreth Vestag , the European Union antitrust chief , said Googl had requir some of the cellphon manufactur to preinstal the company servic , includ it Googl Play smartphon applic store , and had given them unfair financi incent to favor Google servic on their mobil devic . Those practic undermin competit and consum choic , she said .Googl ha abus it domin posit ,  Ms. Vestag said on Wednesday . The company behavior ha harm consum by restrict innov in the wider mobil space.The compani deni it ha broken European competit rule , and the charg may not lead to financi or other penalti against Googl , which now ha three month to respond to the accus .We take these concern serious ,  Kent Walker , Google gener counsel , said in a blog post . But we also believ that our busi model keep manufacturers cost low and their flexibl high , while give consum unpreced control of their mobil devices.By take aim at Android  the mobil softwar that hold more than 80 percent of the worldwid market share for smartphon oper system  Europ ha open the latest chapter in it continu battl with American technolog compani .These player , includ Amazon and Facebook , domin how Europe 500 million peopl use digit servic , includ social media , onlin movi and e-commerc . Googl is face separ charg , file last year , in Europ over whether it unfairli favor some of it search servic over those of rival .Europe antitrust claim highlight Google increasingli thorni relationship with smartphon manufactur such as HTC and Samsung , among other . Ms. Vestag said Android promin role in the mobil market wa not in question but that she wa concern the contract the compani sign with smartphon manufactur had made it difficult , if not imposs , for rival search engin and smartphon app store to compet in the European Union .If a compani is domin , that fine ,  Ms. Vestag told report . But if that domin is abus , then we have an issue. She declin to name which cellphon manufactur might be affect , cite their right to privaci .The devic maker , alreadi struggl against cutthroat competit , have becom reliant on Google digit servic avail on Android , even as they have tri to persuad consum to tri their own mobil servic or those of Google competitor . Some , includ Samsung , have back rival oper system to loosen Android grip , but such effort have so far prove unsuccess .And while global cellphon manufactur onc profit from use Android to expand rapidli , particularli in emerg market , their growth ha sinc slow .Analyst say these cellphon makers inabl to wean consum off Google popular mobil map , email and other servic ha potenti shut them out of billion of dollar in extra revenu as people digit habit  includ onlin search and e-commerc purchas  shift to mobil devic .Their attempt at beat Google servic havent work ,  said Neil Mawston , a mobil analyst at the technolog research group Strategi Analyt . For most compani that want to oper in the smartphon market , there isnt anoth option but to use Google.Repres from the lead smartphon manufactur declin to comment on their relationship with Googl .The domin of Android , at least in Europ and the Unit State , is almost absolut .The basic Android softwar can be download for free and modifi by devic maker and telecom oper .But they must sign contract that place a select of Google servic in prime spot on smartphon screen and link to the company app store , from which Googl take a cut of each applic sold . The search giant also gener incom from advertis from mobil search queri , though manufactur are free to includ their own applic as part of the mobil softwar .In total , Google version of Android power more than 98 percent of the Android-bas smartphon in Europ and the Unit State , accord to Ian Fogg , a senior director at IH , a technolog consult in London .Onli in China , where Googl is ban , and Russia , where the local search engin Yandex hold a signific market share , doe Googl not domin in mobil .If someon buy an Android devic in Europ or the U.S. , it almost certainli Google version ,  said David McQueen , research director at ABI Research in London .Googl say it relationship with cellphon manufactur are voluntari and that rival mobil servic , includ those from the like of Amazon and Facebook , are readili avail on it Android softwar , which doe not restrict peopl from download competitors applic .The search giant ha also point to smartphon from Amazon and Nokia that are base on the free version of Android and that do not come packag with Google mobil servic as sign of healthi competit . Those devic , particularli Amazon Fire smartphon , have not prove popular with consum .Kirt McMaster , the chief execut of Cyanogen , an American start-up that make a mobil oper system base on Android , said he wa cautious optimist that the regulatori intervent could improv innov on the oper system .There are way to enabl next-gener servic on top of Android today , even within the confin of the exist relationship ,  he said . But there are scenario that will be benefici for the ecosystem if Android wa even more open.If Googl is found to have broken European rule , the compani may face fine of as much as 10 percent of it annual revenu . Given the company recent annual revenu , that could be roughli $ 7 billion . Such a high financi penalti is unlik , howev , accord to legal expert .The compani could also be forc to alter it Android softwar to give competitor a greater posit in it mobil softwar or to chang it exist contract with cellphon maker .That would potenti provid European with a wider choic of mobil servic than would be avail to their American counterpart . Most peopl in the 28 member state of the European Union , though , still reli primarili on Googl servic for mani daili activ .Such remedi , if eventu impos on Googl , would be reminisc of similar step taken by Microsoft , which in 2009 agre to offer consum a choic of rival web browser to end a European antitrust investig into it domin of Internet browser at that time .Paulo Trezento , chief execut of Aptoid , a rival Portugues Android app store that is one of the complain in the European competit case against Googl , said hi compani would welcom greater access to Android user .Googl make it difficult for peopl to instal applic from rival ,  Mr. Trezento said .

He need 57 percent of the remain pledg deleg to emerg with a major by the convent .That might not seem like so much , but it a huge number becaus Democrat award their deleg proport in each primari . Mr. Sander , therefor , need to win the rest of the race by a margin of roughli 57 to 43  a big problem for a candid who had been lose by around 57 to 43 . Here one way to think about how big hi deficit is : If all of the 17 contest Mr. Sander won got to vote again ( which is to say , count twice ) , he would still trail Hillari Clinton in the pledg deleg count .Mr. Sander seem on track to win 43 percent of the vote again tonight . By fall short , hi burden in the remain state grow even greater : He might now need 58 or 59 percent of the remain deleg , depend on how the result finish .Mrs. Clinton strength in New York , a state Mr. Sanders advis contend they could win , confirm that he is not on a pace to win the remain state by such a clear margin .To the extent that Mr. Sanders support envis a path to a major of deleg , it hing on the assumpt that he would prove strongest in the most heavili Democrat state , like New York and California .The assumpt wa not consist with the result lead to today . Mr. Sander lost the state most similar to New York or California , like Illinoi and Florida , even Massachusett . In truth , there ha been no relationship between Mr. Sanders strength and the Democrat lean of a counti . The stronger predictor of Mrs. Clinton strength were divers and affluenc  which augur well for her in New York .In the end , Mrs. Clinton won New York thank to big support from nonwhit and affluent voter in New York Citi and it suburb .She swept the Upper West Side , Chelsea , Brooklyn Height and Park Slope . These place vote strongli for past liber challeng , like Zephyr Teachout in the 2014 primari for governor , but not for Mr. Sander .She also swept major black and Hispan precinct , as she ha for most of the cycl .And she fare well in the suburb , win by nearli a two-to-on margin in Westchest Counti , where she live .Mrs. Clinton affluent and divers coalit set her up for a string of win next Tuesday along the Eastern Seaboard , and later in New Jersey . After next Tuesday , Mr. Sander could need 63 or 64 percent of the remain deleg .He will be hard press to make up thi deficit . He ha thrive in caucu state , but there is onli one of those left : North Dakota . Mr. Sander could win 64 percent of the vote in a coupl of mostli white Western primari , like Oregon or Montana . But he unlik to win by much more . He could win in Indiana , Kentucki and West Virginia , but is not like to do so by 64 percent .Mr. Sander could be competit in California , where there are fewer black voter . But the affluenc of the Bay Area and Lo Angel will hurt him there , just as it did in New York City liber bastion . It is hard to imagin a two-to-on victori .It is more like that Mr. Sander ha reach the stage of the campaign where even feel-good victori  like repeat of hi genuin impress win in Michigan  will leav him too far behind .', 'Join us for New York primari live updat .It may be Indiana or bust for Donald Trump .If the poll are right , he will domin in New York on Tuesday and in the come race across the Eastern Seaboard . He could win nearli all of the deleg at stake  keep him on a narrow path toward the Republican nomin . That would set him up for what will probabl be the most import test of the race : Indiana on May 3 .It may sound strang , but when you start game out the rest of the primari contest , it hard to avoid the conclus that hi quest to reach a major of deleg befor the convent could all turn on Indiana . If you divvi up the state by expect result , Mr. Trump win big in the East and West Virginia , lose the winner-take-al rural Western state , and earn hi expect share of proport deleg in Washington , Oregon and New Mexico .That put him about 175 deleg short of the requir 1,237 . Onli two real tossup state remain : California ( 172 deleg ) and Indiana ( 57 ) .You can see the basic issu : If he doesnt win Indiana , he ha to sweep California and get some lucki break elsewher , which isnt realist . He would need an upset in a state like Montana , in a region that ha been hostil to him .But even though Indiana may be pivot  it award it deleg on a winner-take-al basi by congression district and statewid  the state is a big mysteri becaus there hasnt been a singl poll there . That not just becaus of East Coast media bia ( although it may be part of it ) ; it a tough state to poll . Indiana law prohibit autom poll , the go-to method for mani low-cost pollster .The state doe not have parti registr , which make it modestli more challeng and costli for pollster to conduct survey of the voter registr file . Mani of the prolif public pollster employ the random-digit dial method , like Quinnipiac , and have no histori in the state . I suspect that a few pollster will ultim field survey , but there wont be mani .At first glanc , the state look as if it should be a good one for Mr. Trump . It a mostli working-class state with below-averag educ attain among white voter , which ha been a strong correl for Trump support . He ha run well in state along or near the Ohio River , includ Illinoi , Missouri and Kentucki . He lost Ohio , but it wa John Kasich home state . Mr. Trump also won Michigan , which border Indiana to the north .Accord to an Upshot demograph model of Mr. Trump support , Indiana is perhap a tick beneath hi nation averag  he estim to win around 40 percent of the vote , compar with the 43 percent support he hold nationwid . It not a state like Wisconsin , where Mr. Trump wa in obviou danger . That state is better educ than Indiana , it ha higher marriag rate , and it ha more voter with an ancestri root in predominantli Protest countri in northwest Europ , all factor that have hurt Mr. Trump in prior contest .The problem for Mr. Trump is not that Indiana a tough state for him ; it that it a better state for Ted Cruz than mani of the more liber state in the Midwest . And it a wors state for Mr. Kasich . A more consolid anti-Trump vote would give Mr. Cruz a far better chanc of victori here than in Illinoi or Michigan .The split between Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich is alway tough to predict . But in gener , the Cruz/Kasich vote break along the line of cultur liber and conservat . Mr. Cruz doe better ( and Mr. Kasich doe wors ) in area with more evangel Christian , more white Republican and fewer peopl with postgradu educ . Mr. Cruz also doe better in area that look more like the traditional Republican Parti  conserv area with more famili and marri coupl and peopl whose heritag is Protest northwest Europ .Mani of these factor have hurt Mr. Cruz in the blue state of the Midwest . He ha often finish third in more liber place like the Detroit or Chicago metropolitan area . It also whi he pois to fare poorli in the Northeast .But Mr. Cruz ha not had thi problem in less liber metropolitan area in the Midwest , like Milwauke ; Grand Rapid , Mich. ; Kansa Citi , Mo . ; and St. Loui , or in medium-s citi in central Illinoi like Springfield , Peoria , Bloomington or Champaign-Urbana . Mr. Kasich wa no threat to Mr. Cruz in these area , and inde Mr. Cruz wound up beat Mr. Trump in most .The Indianapoli area is somewhat more like Milwauke , St. Loui , Kansa Citi and Grand Rapid than Detroit or Chicago . Most obvious , the Indianapoli area  and the state of Indiana  is conserv and tend to vote Republican . That underpin by the demograph characterist of the state : It more evangel , less educ and , in particular , ha fewer peopl with postgradu degre .The tilt toward evangel and conservat should allow Mr. Cruz to do better in Indiana than he did in Illinoi or Michigan . It could be more like Missouri , which wa almost a tie , or North Carolina , where Mr. Trump won by a slight margin . Mr. Trump also won by a slight margin in Illinoi outsid of the core of the Chicago metropolitan area .That might still seem like a bleak preced for Mr. Cruz . But the upsid for him is that all of those contest occur befor Marco Rubio left the race . The result in Utah and Wisconsin suggest that mani of Mr. Rubio remain voter broke to Mr. Cruz . In Wisconsin , it wa probabl most of them .If the same stori play out in Indiana , Mr. Cruz will probabl win the state . The Upshot demographic-bas model estim after the March 15 primari that Mr. Trump would win Indiana , 41 percent to 37 percent , over Mr. Cruz , with Mr. Kasich at 14 percent and Mr. Rubio at 8 percent . Mr. Cruz would then becom a clear favorit there  similar to what happen in Wisconsin  if he won the preponder of Mr. Rubio voter or benefit from a slide in Mr. Kasich support .And inde Mr. Cruz now ha a slight edg in the same demograph model , 43 percent for Mr. Cruz to 40 percent for Mr. Trump , with 16 percent to Mr. Kasich , after ad the result from Arizona , Wisconsin and Utah and ad a variabl to account for the absenc of Mr. Rubio .But the split between Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich in Indiana should be consid noth more than a rough guess . The same approach estim that Mr. Kasich would win 21 percent of the vote in Wisconsin ; in the end , he won just 14 percent and Mr. Cruz ran up the score . Mr. Cruz could easili gain at Mr. Kasich expens again  especi if he receiv high-profil endors from trust conserv figur , the way he did in Wisconsin .But there downsid for Mr. Cruz . Mr. Kasich seem set to post a seri of rel strong show in the Northeast , which could give him new strength head into Indiana .Indiana also abut Mr. Kasich home state , Ohio , and that could help him as well . Mr. Kasich did a bit better in the southern part of Michigan and in the northern part of Kentucki , area border Ohio , than one would have guess from demograph alon .Even if Mr. Kasich prove as weak as Mr. Cruz hope , Mr. Trump could still win . Mr. Trump figur to be around 40 percent of the vote  and if it a few point on the higher side of that , which is certainli possibl , it will probabl be enough for him to beat even a rel strong Mr. Cruz .The bottom line is that it veri hard to be confid about Indiana forecast . My guess is that we still wouldnt be confid even if there were poll becaus it hard to see a larg advantag for ani candid .What clear is that if Mr. Trump win Indiana , the drama continu on to California ; if he doesnt , even California almost certainli wont be enough for him to secur the nomin by primari season end .', \"( Reuter ) - Coca-Cola Co 's sale fell for the fourth straight quarter as demand weaken for it fizzi drink in Europ and a strong dollar ate into revenu from other market outsid the Unit State , includ Latin America .Share of the world 's largest beverag maker , which maintain it revenu and earn growth forecast for 2016 , fell as much as 5.5 percent to $ 44.06 on Wednesday .Coke and smaller rival PepsiCo Inc have been hurt as consum increasingli turn health-consci , cut back on fizzi drink and opt for tea , fruit juic and smoothi .The rise in the dollar ha also hit the compani , which have a sizeabl presenc in market outsid the Unit State , includ China and Brazil .The averag valu of the dollar rose 2.6 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier .Coke 's sale in Europ , it third biggest market , declin 1 percent in the quarter end April 1 , while Latin America sale plung 12.2 percent .Sale in Asia Pacif , includ China , drop 4 percent , but volum increas as the compani sold more lower-margin product .In Asia , price is expect to be a `` littl volatil and bumpi '' in the come quarter , Chief Oper Offic Jame Quincey said on a post-earn confer call .He said the impact of the `` challeng '' macro environ in China on the industri wa wors than expect and demand in Brazil had suffer due to macroeconom headwind .Coke is bank on new market initi , such as the `` One Brand '' program roll out on Wednesday , to boost sale .All can and bottl of it Coca-Cola brand soda will have a similar appear , promin featur the red color associ with regular Coke , but sport a band of the color that distinguish Diet Coke , Coke Zero and Coke Life .The compani ha also introduc smaller pack , which typic bring higher margin .SALE DROPCoke 's net oper revenu fell 4 percent to $ 10.28 billion .

Mowgli Holm , Phylos chief scienc offic , wa a student of Rob DeSal , a phylogeneticist at the museum .The evolut of the plant wa an intrigu subject , said Dr. Holm , who is a molecular and evolutionari biologist , in addit to be a co-found of Phylo Bioscienc . He said that Dr. DeSal wa obsess with the way that domest pressur chang the pattern of evolution.Phylo ha creat a color 3-D map that visual repres the statist relationship between differ breed of the plant . The compani hope that have genet inform easili avail will help bring order to a busi that began underground and is now make a commerci transit .Over time , the scientist believ , thi sort of visual map can be appli to other type of plant , or even to anim .Wev collect sampl from all over the world , and catalog the genet inform encod in their DNA ,  Dr. Holm said . He liken the DNA sequenc to a bar code that uniqu identifi the sampl and how they interrel .Current , there are a varieti of servic , such as Leafli , Weedmap , Verdabas and Cannabi Report that catalog differ strain of the plant . Howev , the field ha lack the accuraci offer by actual sequenc .Given the histori of the marijuana busi , it is not surpris that sampl repres in the Phylo visual have color name like DJ Short Blueberri , Sweet Island Skunk , Humboldt OG , Bright Moment , Sour Diesel and Cherri Cheesecak , to name a few .One famili known as Girl Scout Cooki may present particular problem for the new industri , accord to Nishan Karassik , Phylos co-found and chief execut , becaus of it potenti legal conflict with the Girl Scout of America .The homegrown root of the marijuana busi have led to a prolifer of local name , Mr. Karassik said . That ha creat a veri local market becaus of that access to the product when it wa underground ,  he said . All other plant and anim have clear pedigre . We need to creat a pedigre system to clarifi this.He said that as marijuana ha becom a commerci product , peopl increasingli want to find the product they like or want to avoid , be they for medic or recreat use .The initi version of Galaxi is larg a framework that visual plot the locat of differ sampl in relationship to one anoth . In the futur , the compani plan to overlay the visual inform with addit data that will includ a varieti of detail attribut , such as the amount of particular compound call cannabinoid that are characterist of the plant . Two of these are cannabidiol ( CBD ) and tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) which give the plant medicin and psychoact qualiti .Mr. Karassik said that Phylo did not plan to breed plant but is hope to charg a small fee for ad detail inform about the sampl that are produc by commerci breeder .Each sampl is repres in a view that resembl a star field broken into cluster that can be thought of as families or tribes. The distanc between the sampl is indic of how much genet materi they share .The compani ha been aid by the collaps cost of genet sequenc .

Such lender typic deposit short-term borrow money directli into a customer check account , then use the same autom system to regularli deduct payment for loan that often have interest rate of 400 percent or more .About half of the account that the agenc examin had one or more autom loan payment request fail , incur an averag of $ 185 in bank fee over the durat of the studi . Bank close the check account of more than a third of the peopl who had a fail payment request .Mani custom reli on autom bank withdraw to cover recur bill like mortgag or car payment , and the overwhelm major of payday loan payment request the bureau studi  94 percent  went through without a problem .But onc a singl payment request fail , it can set off a domino effect of fee and other repercuss . Payday lender often submit multipl request on one day , and some intent break them into chunk  submit three $ 100 request , for exampl , instead of one $ 300 request  in hope that at least one will be fulfil , the bureau found .Lender that are owe money are entitl to get paid back , but we do not want lender to be abus their preferenti access to people account ,  said Richard Cordray , director of the bureau . Borrow should not have to bear the unexpect burden of be hit repeatedli with steep , hidden penalti fee that are tack on to the cost of their exist loans.The new studi is the latest in a seri of payday lend research report that the bureau say it hope will bolster it case for increas regul of the industri . A preliminari set of propos that the agenc is consid , releas a year ago , drew broad , fierc critic . The payday loan industri said the propos rule could depriv low-incom American of a vital sourc of credit , while consum advoc said the rule did not go far enough .Republican lawmak on the Hous Financi Servic Committe sharpli critic the bureau recommend in a hear last month , but Mr. Cordray said he still intend to propos more complet rule within a few month .One rule the bureau is consid would prevent creditor from repeatedli return to a dri well by cut them off after two consecut unsuccess attempt to deduct a loan payment from a borrower bank account . The lender would not be allow to make ani further attempt unless the borrow provid the bank with a new author .Few feder rule govern overdraft and insuffici fund fee , which run around $ 35 per transact at larg bank . The bureau ha express concern about the issu , but ha stop short of say it intend to draft new rule about those fee .Some bank say they have alreadi act to rein in their fee . Bank of America , Citigroup and Well Fargo limit overdraft charg to four per account per busi day , bank repres said .JPMorgan Chase pledg two year ago to chang how it handl automat withdraw for payday loan payment , after a front-pag articl in The New York Time drew attent to the high fee some of it custom incur .The bank now levi onli one insuffici fund fee per account per month for charg from each merchant , prevent custom from be hit with multipl payment request from the same creditor , said Michael Fusco , a JPMorgan spokesman .', 'WASHINGTON  If Saudi Arabia follow through on it recent threat to sell off it invest in the Unit State , the financi maneuv could be pain  mostli for Saudi Arabia .The kingdom ha pump some of it oil profit into the Unit State , acquir billion of dollar in Treasuri secur and invest that includ a giant oil refineri in Port Arthur , Tex. , and a $ 10 million stake in an Arkansa compani that make industri lubric .All of that could be sold off if Congress pass a bill allow Saudi Arabia to be held respons in American court for ani role in the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attack , the Saudi govern warn last week .Such a fire sale might roil financi market or caus problem for compani that lost fund , but expert say it is hard to imagin a signific or last impact on the American economi . Global investor continu to shovel money into the Unit State ; if the Saudi go , the expert say , other will take their place .The world is desper to lend money to anybodi that credibl at veri low rate , so I dont see thi as an issu at all ,  said Michael Petti , a financ professor at Peke Univers who say that foreign divest  by China or other nation  pose littl threat to the American economi .Howev , a sell-off could be self-def for Saudi Arabia . The Port Arthur refineri highlight the cost of pull back .The refineri is own by Motiva Enterpris , a joint ventur between Royal Dutch Shell and Saudi Aramco , the state-own oil giant . Aramco ha a long histori of invest in the Unit State , in part to facilit the sale of Saudi oil to American consum . Last month , Aramco announc a deal to take full ownership of the refineri , along with a network of 26 distribut termin and the right to sell fuel under the Shell brand name across a larg swath of the Unit State , includ Texa .The Saudi might be abl to sell the refineri , but they would lose a strateg invest .For a produc that big , you have to be in everi market in the world to place your oil ,  said Elizabeth Rosenberg , director of the Energi , Econom and Secur Program at the Center for a New American Secur .Aramco also invest in technolog , includ the $ 10 million stake in NanoMech in Arkansa , announc last week , and part ownership of at least eight other small American compani .There is no comprehens public account of the Saudi government invest in the Unit State , although American offici say $ 750 billion is a plausibl figur .And the singl largest chunk of that money is probabl invest in Treasuri secur .The Treasuri Depart say a group of 15 oil-exporting nation includ Saudi Arabia held a total of $ 281 billion in Treasuri in Februari , deposit either in the Unit State or in one of the 15 countri . That number may actual underst the Saudi government hold , howev , becaus it doe not includ Treasuri debt the kingdom may have deposit in other countri like Switzerland .Regardless , it is clear that Saudi Arabia hold are onli a small share of the roughli $ 14 trillion in Treasuri secur not held by the feder govern . There littl doubt the Saudi could sell all of it , gradual , without caus a rippl in the market , expert say .Foreign central bank last year reduc total hold of Treasuri by $ 225 billion , and the market didnt even burp . About $ 502 billion in Treasuri chang hand on the averag trade day in March , accord to the Secur Industri and Financi Market Associ .I would guess that ani reserv manag would be abl to find a way to sell thi amount in under a year without much of a rippl ,  said Stephen G. Cecchetti , a professor of intern econom at Brandei Univers .The Saudi could roil market by offer discount and sell quickli . But again , they would suffer most from such a sale .Their departur from the Treasuri market would tend to put upward pressur on interest rate . Fewer buyer for the same pool of asset make seller tri harder , and rate on Treasuri serv as a benchmark for a wide rang of other borrow cost . But the Feder Reserv could calibr it manag of interest rate to take account of those effect , essenti insul the domest economi .Loui Crandal , chief economist at the research firm Wrightson ICAP , describ the like consequ as lot of short-term technic impact , depend on how fast they did it , rather than fundament problems. He note that larg movement in foreign Treasuri hold had becom a fact of life for the Treasuri market .Saudi Arabia alreadi is sell foreign asset . The Saudi Arabian Monetari Author ha sharpli reduc it foreign hold to help offset declin oil revenu . The author report hold of foreign secur worth $ 395 billion as of Februari , the most recent data avail . That reflect a sharp declin from the end of 2014 , when the hold were valu at $ 533 billion .The share of Treasuri held by foreign investor ha climb sharpli over the last few decad , lead some expert to caution that ani flag of foreign appetit could increas borrow cost both for the feder govern and for American consum and busi .There is littl danger from Treasuri sale by a specif countri , so long as foreign demand in aggreg remain strong . A broader sell-off could be more danger , but those worri have eb . The demand for Treasuri ha seem insati in recent year .Still , Franci E. Warnock , a professor at the Univers of Virginia and an expert on intern econom , said there wa a still a long-term risk .If the Saudi do it , other might do it as well ,  Mr. Warnock said . To me that the bigger issu .

At first , Dr. Katz , who had been on the panel , thought that drug maker had pressur the F.D.A . to kill the propos . Then an agenc offici told him that anoth group had fought the recommend : the American Medic Associ , the nation largest doctor organ .I wa shock ,  said Dr. Katz , the presid of Analges Solut , a compani in Natick , Mass . You go to medic school to help public health and here we have an area where you have 15,000 peopl a year dying.Now , as the White Hous , the Center for Diseas Control and Prevent and other feder and state agenc scrambl to find solut to the vex opioid problem , the role of doctor is come back to center stage . The Obama administr recent announc that it support mandatori train for prescrib of opioid .On Tuesday , a new F.D.A . panel of outsid expert will meet to review onc again whether such train should be requir . The hear will almost certainli touch off an intens debat insid the medic commun and focu attent on medic group like the A.M.A. , which have resist government mandat affect how doctor practic for both ideolog and practic reason . The panel is expect to make it final recommend on Wednesday . An F.D.A . spokeswoman said the agenc now support mandatori train .Sinc 2012 , the F.D.A . ha requir drug compani that produc so-cal long-act opioid  drug like OxyContin , fentanyl and methadon  to underwrit voluntari educ cours on the medic . In a surpris , last week mani of those manufactur came out in support of rule requir doctor to have specif train or expertis in pain manag befor get a licens from the Drug Enforc Administr to prescrib a strong opioid .The approach , which would requir congression action , would ensur that prescrib got appropri train in pain manag with opioid so their patient can continu to access treatment option ,  the group said .Dr. Patric A. Harri , who is the chairwoman of the A.M.A. Task Forc to Reduc Opioid Abus , said the organ wa commit to help doctor better use opioid . But Dr. Harri ad that the A.M.A . continu to oppos mandatori opioid train for doctor becaus mani physician do not prescrib the drug .She ad that the group also oppos law that requir doctor to check databas befor issu a prescript for a narcot painkil . Such law , which a grow number of state have adopt , are intend to help doctor identifi patient who seek prescript from multipl physician and to help doctor avoid prescrib danger combin of drug . Data show that when such program are voluntari , mani doctor do not use them .We know these tool are a great tool in the toolbox ,  said Dr. Harri , who is a psychiatrist . But they are not a panacea.Doctor say measur like check prescript databas take up more time in day alreadi fill with bureaucrat duti , and mani express ideolog concern about government reach into medicin . And expert say mani doctor believ that their practic and their patient are not respons for the opioid problem .Timothi Condon , a former offici at the Nation Institut on Drug Abus , said he encount that attitud in 2010 when sever feder agenc approach the A.M.A . and medic group repres specialist to seek their support for mandatori physician train .The take-hom messag wa , who are you as fed to tell us how to practic medicin , you alreadi regul us so much ,  said Mr. Condon , who is now a research professor at the Univers of New Mexico in Albuquerqu .He ad that when he counter that the scale of the prescript that doctor were write for opioid wa central to the overdos problem , the respons from the medic group wa silence.Mandatori train befor prescrib the drug is not the onli area where govern offici and medic expert are cautious circl each other .The Obama administr ha ask American medic school to incorpor new recommend from the Center for Diseas Control and Prevent about how to treat pain into their curriculum . Along with urg physician to tri nondrug approach first , the guidelin suggest that opioid be use sparingli .So far , howev , onli about one-quart of the 145 teach institut that belong to a major organ , the Associ of American Medic Colleg , have agre to incorpor the C.D.C . guidelin into their program .Dr. Darrel G. Kirch , the organization presid , said hi group and medic school were activ work to reduc inappropri opioid use . But he ad that mani institut prefer to develop teach guidelin base on their own expertis .In addit , Dr. Kirch said that medic school leader fear that commit to one feder guidelin could lead to a situat where lawmak impos agenda on physician that are in the interest of patient care .Last week , the F.D.A releas data show the impact of a voluntari approach to educ doctor . The figur show that onli about half of the 80,000 doctor who the agenc had hope would receiv train by March 2015 had complet it .While the agenc said the result make it difficult to draw conclus regard the success of the program , it also rais concern that requir train could make it harder for patient to get need drug . The F.D.A . will also ask the panel to review whether doctor who prescrib so-cal short-act narcot like Percocet or Vicodin should have access to train .The medic commun is not monolith in it view . Recent , for exampl , the Massachusett Medic Societi support legisl in that state impos a limit on an initi opioid prescript to a seven-day suppli . Some doctor and dentist give patient 60 or 90 high-strength painkil , enough for a month , give rise to potenti misus of the drug or open a door to addict .Dr. Katz , the pain expert in Massachusett , said he understood the resist of physician to mandat , includ the fear that malpractic lawyer will seek to wield them as weapon . But he ha been urg regul for about 15 year to requir doctor to undergo mandatori train .There is incred ration that exist ,  he said . There is a problem , and patient and doctor are a part of it .

The two nomine , Hester Peirc and Lisa M. Fairfax , were clear by these same Democrat senat after a revolt over the White House first propos nomine , Keir D. Gumb , a partner at the law firm Covington & Burl .Mr. Gumbs previou experi includ six year at the S.E.C. , in part as counsel to an S.E.C . commission . Unfortun , Mr. Gumbs sin wa that he wa from corpor America becaus he repres such client as the American Petroleum Institut . Senat Elizabeth Warren of Massachusett reportedli quash hi appoint on those ground , protest that it wa time to put more independent-mind regul on the commiss . Never mind that there is an import distinct between lawyer repres client and lawyer repres caus and that a lawyer is ethic oblig to repres a client regardless of person opinion .Into thi morass came Ms. Peirc and Ms. Fairfax . The S.E.C . ha five commission , who are appoint by the presid , but no more than three can belong to the same parti . Ms. Peirc wa a Republican nomine . She serv on Senat Richard Shelby staff at the Senat Committe on Bank , Hous and Urban Affair , which he head and which overse the S.E.C . For the last few year , Ms. Peirc ha been an academ fellow at the Mercatu Center , a conservative-lean institut at Georg Mason Univers . Needless to say , she is not from the corpor world .The second nomine , Ms. Fairfax , wa presum vet by Senat Warren and reportedli push forward by Senat Sherrod Brown , Democrat of Ohio . Ms. Fairfax is a professor at the Georg Washington Univers School of Law , and befor that the Univers of Maryland School of Law . She is view by mani as a percept and knowledg observ of our capit market ( full disclosur  as a law professor , I have regularli interact with her ) .So two academ without experi in the corpor world . Check .Let just stop here and agre that Senat Warren ha a point : Our regul should not be captiv to the compani and industri they regul . We should be wari of the encroach of industri on regul independ . But thi doe not mean that all peopl from the corpor world are the devil . Clearli , a care mix would seem to be the best approach . There is valu in have knowledg of the real world .Washington revolv door is a problem , and thi appli equal to those who come from academia and those who come from industri . Senat Warren , for exampl , is a former academ and use her polit posit as a springboard to the Senat  a sort of revolv door . Some sensibl moder is like to be the best tonic to thi problem .With two nomine vet through Senat Warren and a balanc ticket of Republican and Democrat , one would have thought the confirm hear last month would go smoothli . Most of it wa pretti routin in which senat ask about the academics write from year ago .Then thing went off the rail .Senat Schumer ask about disclosur of polit donat . Thi ha been a hot-button issu sinc the 2010 Suprem Court decis in the Citizen Unit case upheld the right of corpor , as associ of individu , to make polit donat freeli .That rule inspir sharehold advoc to press for mandat that corpor disclos their polit spend so the sharehold could assess it and perhap limit thi activ .Disclosur mandat have sometim involv push other agenda like incom inequ ( compens ratio disclosur ) or foreign polici ( conflict miner ) onto public compani . But a disclosur mandat on polit donat appear to make more sens in a post-Citizen Unit world . After all , if compani are act on behalf of their stockhold in make these donat , they should let sharehold know about it .In an interview on Tuesday , Senat Schumer said , If one feel that undisclos special interest money cascad into our polit is one of the worst problem American face , then thi approach is veri logic . Thi is not a judg , but a regul , and the public ha a right to know whether they would support move forward with a rule that fundament to our democracy.Like all thing , though , it is a bit more complic . The S.E.C . ostens ha been bar by Congress for a year from mandat thi disclosur . There is also a real question about whether such person donat would even be materi , the requir for the SEC to mandat disclosur without congression action .Loom in the background are the feder court , which have repeatedli struck down S.E.C . rule that have been impos without an adequ basi . If the S.E.C . adopt a polit donat disclosur rule , they are like to ask about materi . And rememb , thi rule will appli onli to public compani , encourag nonpubl one to stay privat .Still , 1.1 million peopl have petit the S.E.C . to adopt thi rule , which mean there is some popular support .Dure the confirm hear , Senat Schumer want to get the S.E.C . nomine to commit to adopt a rule requir thi disclosur , and he said that if they did not commit , he would hold up their nomin .Both nomine said they would take it under advis , which is what they should have said , although with her background , Ms. Fairfax is like to be a support of the rule .Four Democrat senat , includ Senat Schumer and Warren , are protest these nomine . The Republican are no doubt fine with thi state of affair , becaus with onli three sit commission at the S.E.C. , the Republican repres can just abstain from vote , leav the agenc in stasi .The four Senat can not push through legisl to accomplish a polit disclosur rule , so they are do the onli thing they can . They are hold up the S.E.C . nomine as leverag to get some progress on the rule . Thi is a direct messag to Mari Jo White , chairwoman of the S.E.C. , who ha been hold off on act on thi rule .Nevertheless , the S.E.C . is left short-hand and deadlock . No other nomine will make the pledg Senat Schumer want becaus it would mean that ani vote on the issu would be taint .When I ask Senat Schumer about whether he would ultim hold up the nomine over thi issu , he respond , Well cross that bridg if we come to it.One the one hand thi is just regular polit . Senat Schumer and hi cohort are tri to counter Citizen Unit through some regular old Senat obstruction . But on the other it is hard to see ani S.E.C . nomine commit to more , at least publicli . And given Professor Fairfax write , it is difficult to see her not support thi rule . So we await for a logjam that should and must break to actual break .Meanwhil , the S.E.C. , with all of it work to do regul and polic our capit market , will wait as it get caught up in a meaningless and opaqu polit battl .', 'Custom and retail may have one less reason to dislik new chip-en debit and credit card  if onli by a littl bit .Visa said on Tuesday that it would begin provid softwar to reduc the time peopl spend use new chip card , which have small metal squar on the front .The chang address one of the widespread complaint about the card , that they take too long to process .

Accord to a separ Pew poll of member of the American Associ for the Advanc of Scienc , 65 percent of scientist want more nuclear power too .Ted Cruz argument that climat chang is a hoax to justifi a govern takeov of the world is absurd . But Berni Sanders argument that toxic wast byproduct of nuclear plant are not worth the risk of the technology benefit might also be damag .Highlight the left bias may seem like a pointless effort to apport equal blame along ideolog line . But it is critic to understand how they have come into be . It suggest how difficult it will be to overcom our scientif and technolog taboo .Research suggest that better scientif knowledg will not be suffici , on it own , to overcom our bias .

The thiev in Bangladesh may have spent month lurk insid the central bank comput , studi how to steal the necessari credenti to gain access to Swift .It is the digit version of the heist depict in the movi Ocean Eleven ,  said Adrian Nish , head of the cyberthreat intellig team at BAE System , a defens and secur compani .The trend is move from opportunist crime to Hollywood-scal attack ,  said Mr. Nish , whose firm ha analyz the malwar believ to have been use in the Bangladesh breach .In the Unit State , most bank take special precaut with their Swift comput , build multipl firewal to isol the system from the bank other network and keep the machin physic isol in a separ lock room .But elsewher , some bank take far fewer precaut . And secur expert who have analyz the Swift breach said they had conclud that the Bangladesh bank may have been particularli vulner to an attack .Swift is a great organ ,  said Chri Larsen , the founder of Rippl , a financi technolog compani that aim to speed up global money transmiss . But the system is fractur and antiqu . The way it is set up , you can not total isol problem in a place like Bangladesh from the whole network.In some way , Swift is a testament to how technolog ha help all countri  includ poorer one  gain access to the financi system . But that broader access ha a downsid .The central bank in Bangladesh , by some account , employ fewer protect against cyberattack than mani other larg bank . The bank , for exampl , use $ 10 router and no firewal , accord to news report .The server softwar that the Bangladesh bank employ wa a Swift product call Allianc Access , which connect bank to the central messag system . In a sign of how serious Swift regard the breach of Allianc Access , the group issu a mandatori softwar update last week to help it member identifi possibl irregular .These hacker figur out thi wa a weak point on the peripheri , and they went for it ,  said Jeffrey Kutler , editor in chief at the Global Associ of Risk Profession , a trade group . But they were not abl to compromis the core.Swift core is built on technolog that ha been evolv for decad . What began in 1973 as a rel small network of 240 bank in Europ and North America is now a sprawl network of 11,000 user that includ both bank and larg corpor . At first , Swift could be use to author payment across nation border . But it is now also use to transmit messag relat to domest payment , secur settlement and other transact .Swift growth in recent year  it set a record for messag in March  reflect the increasingli global and interconnect natur of financ . But it also show the risk of so mani financi instruct run through a singl system made up of a patchwork of bank and compani with vari level of onlin protect .Each bank on the Swift network is identifi by a set of code . And it wa the code assign to the Bank of Bangladesh that were recogn  correctli  by the Feder Reserv Bank of New York when it transfer $ 81 million of the Bangladesh bank money to the Philippin , not know that someon , somewher , had stolen the credenti of the Bangladesh bank and instal malwar to cover hi or her track .Initi , the thiev request the transfer of $ 951 million into a hand of bank account in Sri Lanka and the Philippin  a number that prompt the New York Fed to ask the Bangladesh bank to reconfirm that it inde want to move the money .In the end , the Fed process onli five of the 35 fraudul payment request , after it could not reconfirm with offici in Bangladesh .The hacker seem to time the attack perfectli : When offici from the Fed tri to reach out to Bangladesh , it wa a weekend there and no one wa work . By the time central banker in Bangladesh discov the fraud , it wa the weekend in New York and the Fed offic were close .To conceal the crime , the malwar disabl a printer in the Bangladesh bank to prevent offici from review a log of the fraudul transfer .The money wa transfer to account in the Philippin and then into the Philippin casino system , which is exempt from mani of the country anti-money-laund requir .The New York Fed ha been critic for let the $ 81 million slip out . Repres Carolyn B. Maloney , a New York Democrat and member of the Financi Servic Committe , ha call for an investig , warn that the breach threaten to undermin the confid that foreign central bank have in the Feder Reserv , and in the safeti and sound of intern monetari transactions.The New York Fed said in a statement that there is no evid that ani Fed system were compromised and that the transfer of the money had been fulli authenticated by Swift .Swift , which pride itself on it secreci and low public profil , also put out a statement about the attack . But it execut declin to speak on the record about the episod , which are still under investig . The group chairman , Yawar Shah , who is a senior execut at Citigroup , also declin to comment .In it statement , Swift emphas that the hacker had been abl to breach onli some of the bank that commun over Swift , not the network itself .The common in what we have seen is that ( intern or extern ) attack have success compromis banks own environ ,  Swift said .Even if offici at the Bangladesh bank had employ the highest of secur measur , the thiev display a level of skill , cun and determin that may have been abl to penetr a far more secur system .If you have an attack who realli want to get in and know there is a big prize ,  Mr. Nish said , keep them out over the long term is realli difficult.', 'Yoox Net-a-Port , an e-commerc group that call itself the world biggest luxuri fashion store ,  is set it sight on the Middl East , sell a 100 million-euro stake to Alabbar Enterpris , the Dubai , Unit Arab Emirates-bas owner of Emaar Properti , which includ the Dubai Mall , the world most-visit luxuri shop mall .The world biggest onlin retail is join forc with the world biggest brick-and-mortar retail ,  Federico Marchetti , chief execut of Yoox Net-a-Port , said in a call from Milan .In a deal announc on Tuesday in Milan , Alabbar , which is control by Moham Alabbar , will pay 28 a share , a premium of 5.7 percent on the close share price of Yoox Net-a-Port on Monday .

But those who onc flock to the busi with dream of make the next standout televis commerci are no longer drawn to the industri in the same way . Some view advertis as stodgi  who want to make a 30-second TV commerci when everyon they know is cut the cord ?  and some are lure by the rich and prestig of the technolog industri .The result is that even stori agenc like McCann , which ha produc campaign such as the 1971 Hilltop ad for Coca-Cola , now find themselv desper for young peopl at the moment when the tradit advertis industri is struggl as never befor to adapt to a chang media landscap that these same young peopl are shape .The biggest threat  and one of the biggest thing that we talk a lot about  is not onli attract but retain young talent becaus there are so mani more option ,  said David Droga , the creativ chairman and founder of the agenc Droga5 . Wev lost peopl to Facebook . Wev lost peopl to Googl ; wev lost peopl to Apple.To enhanc their appeal , mani agenc are tri to make themselv look less like Madison Avenu and more like the start-up and tech compani that are now dip into the same talent pool . Cue the employe happi hour , tabl tenni and free snack . But the advertis industri face much deeper issu that can not be fix with cosmet chang .Cool new technolog like virtual realiti have imperil the art of the televis commerci , which is still , in mani way , the bread and butter of advertis agenc .

About 25 percent of the industri make less than $ 50,400 a year .Beanbag and softbal match and a cool Twitter handl doesnt make young peopl want to work at your offic ,  Mr. Droga said . To attract young peopl , he ad , advertis agenc need to produc excit work again , which mani have stop do .Perhap just as import , the advertis industri seem unabl to shake the percept that it is stuck in the past .

The lawsuit ha rais question about gender and racial divers and ha prompt the industri to acknowledg longstand problem with it cultur .Even as mani agenc execut insist that their compani are still the best place for creativ mind to shine , they are find it more difficult to maintain their rank . Turnov at advertis agenc is higher than in competit industri like technolog and manag consult , and the gap increas 10 percent in the last year , accord to a studi from LinkedIn and the 4A .A lot is at stake : If agenc can not recruit and retain top young talent , the craft of tradit advertis  an import part of cultur for better or wors  could disappear .We have to fill the pipelin with young talent ,  said Toni Weisman , chief execut in North America for the agenc DigitasLBi . If agenc fail to recruit and keep top young employe , he said , Wer go to becom archaic.Lose young talent is a problem other industri face as well .

The agenc also provid yoga class , boot camp workout class and wine tast . The agenc Ogilvi & Mather ha beer on the first Friday of everi month . McCann allow employe to brew their own beer that is then name after client .

The agenc BBDO ha creat a separ space in it New York offic , call Xlab , where restless mind can experi with virtual realiti and drone . ( In a bit of a twist , BBDO also happen to be behind the Gener Electr campaign aim at get young peopl to work for the compani . )To reinforc that advertis is an actual career rather than a consol prize or a steppingston to someth better , agenc like Ogilvi & Mather , Deutsch , Droga5 and DigitasLBi are also bolster their train and mentorship program .The chang are gear toward attract and retain peopl like Allan Holm , 29 , who join the agenc Leo Burnett in Chicago after graduat from the Savannah Colleg of Art and Design in 2011 , but now work at Facebook Creativ Shop , the company in-hous agenc . He said he wa attract to Facebook , which he join roughli two year ago , becaus it had the same sort of energy as a start-up .

See you then !', \"Googl is a top target for European regul and privaci watchdog , who openli fear and distrust it domin . The American tech giant search engin alon gobbl up roughli 90 percent of the European market .But a landmark court rule intend to rein in Googl ha instead put it at the forefront of Europe enforc of Internet privaci . That ha upend convent wisdom about the compani and rais question about the role of commerci interest in protect people privaci , often with littl or no transpar .In the almost two year sinc European gain the right to be forgotten on the Internet , Googl ha pass judgment in over 418,000 case  roughli 572 a day  from peopl want link of certain search result to be remov , accord to the compani 's record . It ha approv fewer than half of those request , all behind close door .Google total number of privacy-rel judgment is doubl those of most of Europe biggest individu nation author over the same period , even though these public agenc address a wider rang of data protect complaint .Despit a histori of animos toward the compani , nation regul have hand over the review power to Googl with few complaint , say they are mere follow Europe complex data protect rule . Other search compani , includ Microsoft , have been given the same author , though their number of judgment pale by comparison .Some consum group and privaci expert are not satisfi with that arrang . They have sound alarm bell over a for-profit compani  one that reli on tap into people digit live to make billion of dollar and that is the subject of multipl privaci and antitrust investig  play such a central role in protect individuals data , and do so in such a secret manner .Googl ha not respond to request , includ an open letter last year from primarili European and American academ , to explain how it review process work . And sinc 2014 , when right to be forgotten wa enshrin , the compani ha declin to give ani journalist access to it team of fewer than 50 employe  mostli lawyer and paraleg base at it Dublin offic  who review the demand . Googl also did not respond to question for thi articl about the decis process .It a half-bak solut ,  said Luciano Floridi , a Univers of Oxford professor who previous sat on an advisori council to help Googl handl it role as a de facto privaci regul . If Europ realli want to regain control over person data , give Googl thi type of power is an odd outcome.Less than 1 percent of Google decis are appeal to Europe privaci author , accord to the regulators statist , and those author said they gener rule in the company favor .But sever individu who sent request to Googl told The New York Time that the lack of detail over how these decis were made left them frustrat and , in some case , angri that a compani adjud on such delic matter . These peopl spoke on the condit of anonym becaus they did not want to public their own privaci case .If govern were handl right to be forgotten ,  they would have to publish data ,  said Martin Husovec , a professor at the Tilburg Institut for Law , Technolog , and Societi in the Netherland , and a signatori of the open letter to Googl . But with Googl , we cant see what happen behind the company close doors.After Europe highest court rule in May 2014 that peopl with connect to the Contin could ask search engin like Googl and Microsoft Bing to remov link about themselv from onlin search result , the compani were hand the power to decid which of these request were legitim . Cite European privaci rule , the European Court of Justic mandat that search engin , and not a public bodi , should be the first port of call for the decis . Europe top court did not requir that compani make their decision-mak process open to public scrutini .People privaci request must relat to onlin inform , like person circumst or a past crimin convict , that is no longer relev or not in the public interest , definit that privaci lawyer say are inher fuzzi .Thu far , that ha mostli involv peopl demand mundan inform like phone number or address be remov from link to onlin directori ( the largest collect group of site affect ) . Individu have also request that link to refer about themselv on social media , includ Facebook , be taken down .In some case , howev , newspap articl , includ one in The Time cover somewhat question busi practic , have been remov from European search result . Elsewher , a Romanian websit that publish court proceed ha been hit with complaint .Peopl request the remov of link must submit an onlin form , attach an offici ID .Though Googl would not comment publicli about the review process , two compani execut gave some detail on how decis were made . They spoke to The Time on the condit they not be name .Typic , request are sent to Google legal team . Straightforward rule , like those that involv a public figur who can not legal appli for link to be remov , are handl by junior staff member . Tougher decis are refer to senior lawyer who must weigh an individual privaci against the public right to inform , the compani offici said .When Google team accept a request , it inform an individu that the privaci demand ha been success , while also notifi the websit that link to certain European search result have been remov . The websit can not appeal the decis . If Googl refus the request , the compani must tell an individu that the decis can be appeal , but doe not specif explain whi the submiss fail .Some European offici remain wari of hand Googl the power to make privaci decis , though they declin to comment publicli on the court-mand privaci process . But regul acknowledg that the company system  which ha so far dealt with remov request for 1.4 million link  ha prove surprisingli straightforward . Some offici also remain satisfi that Googl make these initi privaci rule despit a lack of open over how decis are made .When it come to appeal , we agre with Googl most of the time ,  said Mathia Moulin , a deputi director at the Commiss Nation de lInformatiqu et de Libert , the French privaci author .Thi mute offici respons  from both European regul and politician  is partli becaus agenc lack the financi , technic and human resourc to handl the substanti influx of right to be forgotten request , accord to regulatori offici and legal expert .Still , for privaci campaign and some regul , Google regulatori track record remain outweigh by Europe effect hand the polic of one of it fundament right to a for-profit compani .I Googl the right entiti to have such power over these decis ?  said Johann Caspar , supervisor at the Hamburg data protect author , the primari regul in Germani that overse American tech compani such as Alphabet , the parent compani of Googl , and Facebook .

The unpreced scale of the Googl Librari Book Project , by itself , warrant a reconsider of fair use in thi case.In a statement releas on Monday , the Author Guild said that the Suprem Court decis to not hear the case would leav writer vulner to copyright infring . It also suggest the case would have broader impact beyond the book industri .The denial of review is further proof that wer wit a vast redistribut of wealth from the creativ sector to the tech sector , not onli with book , but across the spectrum of the art ,  the guild presid , the novelist Roxana Robinson , said in the statement .In it own Suprem Court brief , Googl said both reader and writer were better off thank to it effort .

How much imperfect is requir to be convict of the feder crime of mail and wire fraud ha been clarifi , at least a littl bit , by recent appeal court decis recogn that some lie is accept , and even expect , in the busi world .The Unit State Court of Appeal for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago overturn the convict of David Weimert , a former vice presid of AnchorBank in Wisconsin . He wa charg with wire fraud for hi role in the sale of the bank share of a commerci real estat develop in Texa in which he took a minor posit in the deal along with the buyer .It turn out that Mr. Weimert misl both side about hi role in the deal . He told the buyer that AnchorBank want him to take a piec of the transact , while inform the bank that the buyer insist he come in as a partner in the deal . When the sale close , the bank got about a third more than it expect to make .That a pretti nice outcom , but onc the bank learn about Mr. Weimert decept , it fire him . To make matter wors , AnchorBank had receiv feder bailout fund dure the financi crisi , so the Justic Depart pursu the case becaus of the potenti misus of taxpay money .He wa convict of five count of wire fraud at trial and sentenc to 18 month in prison . But the appeal court conclud there wa not enough evid to show ani fraud despit hi not tell the truth to either side , take the rare step of order that Mr. Weimert be acquit of the charg .The appeal court focus on the fact that there were ongo negoti between the bank and the buyer , so that it is not unusu for parti to conceal from other their true goal , valu , prioriti , or reserv price in a propos transaction. In other word , no one tell the truth when they are negoti a deal .Inde , the opinion went even further in analyz what can amount to a fraud dure negoti .To state the obviou , they will often tri to mislead the other parti about the price and term they are will to accept . Such decept are not crimin ,  the court found .To violat the wire fraud statut , ani decept must be materi ,  which mean a reason person would consid it import in the transact . Statement like thi is my final offer or I cant go ani lower than this are not someth on which the other side is like to reli . The appeal court assert that negoti parti , and certainli the sophist businessmen in thi case , do not expect complet candor about negoti positions.Can it realli be that lie are accept in a negoti ? No less than Professor Jame J . White , a renown commerci law scholar , onc wrote that to conceal one true posit , to mislead an oppon about one true settl point , is the essenc of negotiation. You can not lie about whether you will pay the amount promis , or mislead about the condit of properti , but tell the truth about what it will take to get the deal done appear to be accept .Mr. Weimert lie to hi employ , but that wa not enough to turn thi into a success wire fraud case becaus AnchorBank had been inform that he wa act on both side of the deal , even if it wa misl about how he came to be an investor in the transact .Thi type of breach of an employee duti of candor wa onc prosecut under the right of honest services form of fraud , which let prosecutor reach dishonesti in busi deal . But the Suprem Court limit that type of prosecut to onli those involv a bribe or kickback in 2010 in Skill v. Unit State , someth that wa miss in Mr. Weimert case .The find that there wa no fraud despit the decept is consist with two decis issu last Decemb in other feder appeal court that consid what rise to the level of fraud .The Unit State Court of Appeal for the Second Circuit in Manhattan overturn the secur fraud convict of Jess C. Litvak , a former Jefferi & Compani trader , over lie to buyer about the price the firm paid for residenti mortgage-back secur he sold .The appeal court found that the trial judg improperli exclud evid to support the defens that institut investor like those Mr. Litvak dealt with did not care about what Jefferi paid for the secur .A juri could reason have found that misrepresent by a dealer as to the price paid for certain R.M.B. . would be immateri to a counterparti that reli not on a market price or the price at which prior trade took place , but instead on it own sophist valuat method and comput model ,  the judg explain .Unlik Mr. Weimart case , howev , the appeal court order a retrial of the charg becaus the buyer might have consid what he said to be import . The second trial is schedul to begin in Juli , so Mr. Litvak will get anoth chanc to convinc the juri that not tell the truth wa immateri to sophist buyer .The Unit State Court of Appeal for the First Circuit in Boston overturn a find by the Secur and Exchang Commiss that one statement in a present with 20 slide made to investor that describ a typical portfolio rather than the actual hold of a bond fund wa fraudul .Even if it were mislead , the statement wa hardli materi in a detail discuss with sophist institut that could inquir further about the fund hold if they were interest . Context make a differ ,  the appeal court point out , so what might appear to be mislead may in fact not be of much consequ .Do these decis give a judici imprimatur to lie ? No judg will ever take a posit against tell the truth , but in a crimin fraud prosecut , the govern must do more than just show a decept , even one that help make money .Fraud is a type of larceni , so there must be a victim who ha been improperli depriv of someth of valu . If one side should expect to be lie to , then the messag is to take ani represent with a larg dollop of salt , and not complain too much about somehow be deceiv when tri to make a deal .', 'Q .

Financi servic , by contrast , grew 8.1 percent  onli half as fast as dure the peak of the stock market boom last year .The rebound ha meant brisk busi for peopl like Wu Chao , a manag at a branch offic of Maitian , a popular Beij real estat agenc .In an interview on Monday at hi sale offic Shuangj , an affluent area in central Beij with a nice view of the main busi district and a short walk to an intern school , Mr. Wu explain some of the main reason for the properti price ralli .Nearli all of the factor cite by Mr. Wu involv chang in or market reaction to govern polici . Those includ restrict on home purchas in Beij by nonresid , the annual meet last month of the nation legislatur , the offici end of the one-child polici and recent central bank action .Most wealthi Chines prefer not to borrow for home purchas , settl the deal in cash instead . But Mr. Wu said a round of interest rate cut had made mortgag increasingli attract .Even veri rich peopl sometim would not pay the full amount ,  he said of thi trend . They will take advantag of loan to buy homes.Still , some economist doubt the recent ralli can be sustain for much longer .Zhao Yang , the chief China economist at Nomura in Hong Kong , point to the huge suppli of home either still under construct or complet but unsold . He calcul that floor space under construct is enough to suppli more than six years worth of sale .The sector still face long-term destock pressur ,  Mr. Zhao wrote on Monday in an email .A turnaround in the government polici stanc is also a factor , as it seek to limit the risk that the market could deflat in a messi fashion .Dure thi round of price surg , there are sign of bubbl factor ,  Mr. Zhao wrote . The govern ha start to roll out polici to rein in the increas of hous prices.', 'The elect of a presid of the Unit State isnt just democraci in circuslik action . It also may be , at it core , the most elabor and expens recruit and hire process that mankind ha ever creat .You can think of a presidenti elect as be like a particularli larg company search for a chief execut . In thi case , the search cost a coupl of billion dollar ( the amount that will be expend on campaign ) , ha a hire committe of 127 million peopl ( the number of voter last cycl ) , and is cover at everi turn by virtual everi media organ on earth .What , then , can the latest evid about best hire practic tell us about the elect , in which hire the best employe ha particularli high stake ? Good news : The answer might just make you feel a littl better about American democraci .In the last sever year , there ha been a lot of evid , both from academ work and from compani that approach recruit analyt , that tradit job interview arent particularli good tool for identifi the best employe .One conclus : It a bad idea to hire someon primarili base on a job interview , or on a manager gut instinct . Some peopl perform better when be interview , but that seem to be a self-contain skill . It doesnt tell you much about whether a person would be a good softwar engin or account .Interview are like to feel they are get use inform from unstructur interview , even when they are useless ,  conclud a 2013 articl in the academ journal Judgment and Decis Make . Our simpl recommend for those who make screen decis is not to use them ,  wrote Jason Dana , Robyn Daw and Nathani Peterson .Major compani have come to the same conclus . Googl long had a reput for put job candid through multipl interview and ask potenti employe brain-teaser-typ question to see how they respond . Not anymor .We look at ten of thousand of interview , and everyon who had done the interview and what they score the candid , and how that person ultim perform in their job ,  Google chief human resourc execut , Laszlo Bock , told The New York Time in 2013 . We found zero relationship . It a complet random mess.Mayb the search committe for the next presid  that is , everi American voter  shouldnt put too much weight on what they see in unstructur press interview with candid . I argu that speech and debat perform fit the same pattern , in that they are perform that dont tell you a ton about how a person would perform in the vast portion of the presid that take place off-camera .So what doe work ? Googl found that structur interview , in which applic are ask uniform , concret question , were help .And a larg bodi of work suggest that test and simul can give particularli use inform about how a person will perform on the job .Economist look at data from firm employ low-skil worker , in which some manag had the discret to hire the employe they thought were the best fit , while other reli on a perform test . Those hire with test alon stay in the job 15 percent longer than those chosen by manag , a sign they were a better match . And in an experi with British doctor , a daylong seri of simul , such as interact with an actor play a sick patient , more accur predict their futur perform than a 90-minut test .Plenti of compani in a wide rang of field have embrac the idea . Consult firm like McKinsey have long hire bright young M.B.A. in part by give them a case studi of a busi challeng and ask them a seri of question about how they would approach the problem .If test and simul are the way to go in pick an employe , what doe that mean for pick a presid ?Perhap the ideal scenario would be to put Ted Cruz and Donald Trump and Hillari Clinton and Berni Sander through a simul in which they must jump between persuad a member of Congress to vote for a highway bill and conduct an arm control negoti .That wont happen anytim soon . But in a weird way , we might be see a version of exactli that simul .What are the qualiti it take to be a success presid ? He or she need to be good at hire and trust the right peopl ; make constant big decis with limit inform and often while exhaust ; set the right big pictur strategi ; and know when to stick with it as circumst chang and when to make tactic adjust .If you look at it that way , run a presidenti campaign start to look like exactli the kind of simul of be presid that our search committe need to pick a presid !The lead candid in thi campaign come from veri differ background : two senat , a former secretari of state and a businessman , which make it hard to judg them against one anoth . But right now wer see an apples-to-appl comparison in how they run a campaign .Is the campaign disciplin and well run , display the aforement mix of smart big-pictur strategi and clever tactic choic ? Doe the candid hire skill employe and put trust in peopl who are compet ? Doe the candid have the kind of stamina to put in the long hour of campaign , or doe that person get tire and say the wrong thing or make bad decis ?It easi to critic the length of American campaign , and the complex of the system by which deleg are select to choos each party nomine . But in a weird way , the durat and complex of the task make campaign an even better hire test . Just as a daylong simul wa a better way to judg the compet of British doctor than a 90-minut test , a long campaign give more time for a person to flunk the simul by make bad strateg decis , listen to bad advic or say someth stupid .In earli 2008 , a person would have had plenti of reason to be skeptic about whether Barack Obama , who had serv in the Senat for about three year and had never run anyth larger than hi Senat offic , had the leadership chop to run the entir feder govern . The fact that he ran hi primari campaign more effect than Mrs. Clinton wa one piec of evid that he did .The American campaign system ha evolv over the year without ani master plan . But whenev you groan about yet anoth state primari or long debat , look at it thi way : If you were on the search committe to hire a C.E.O. , you would want the longest , hardest simul you could get . And in your role on thi veri larg search committe , that exactli what your get .', 'HONG KONG  An American labor union is push the Unit State to impos broad , steep tariff on aluminum import use a little-us but wide-rang trade law that ha rile the country trade partner in the past .The effort by the Unit Steelwork union come with trade increasingli an election-year issu in the Unit State and elsewher . More than three-quart of the Unit State aluminum smelt industri that exist five year ago will have been idl or shut down by thi summer as import have surg , accord to the union legal petit .The union blame China rise export , though if success it effort would also affect American import from Canada and mani other countri .The union law firm on Monday file a petit cover raw aluminum import with an American trade panel . The petit invok Section 201 of the 1974 Trade Act . The section wa last invok by Presid Georg W. Bush in 2001 to start a legal process that led to American tariff on steel import the follow year .A Section 201 case cover essenti all import of a product from all over the world . That make it more substanti than anti-subsidi and anti-dump case against import from a singl countri . The European Union object to Presid Bush use of Section 201 , which result in American tariff on a wide rang of steel product , until the administr drop them in late 2003 .But Section 201 case are also harder to win . They requir proof that a domest industri ha been serious injured by import , a harder test than the mere proof of injury from import that is requir for other trade case .Terenc P. Stewart , the manag partner of the law firm Stewart and Stewart and the lead lawyer on the aluminum case , contend that raw aluminum could meet the test . The domest industri is disappear befor our eye ,  he said . Quick relief and address the underli imbal between global suppli and demand are essenti if we are go to have ani industri left.The union also argu that aluminum is import to nation defens becaus it is wide use in militari equip .Section 201 case are review by the Unit State Intern Trade Commiss , a bipartisan , quasi-judici group of trade expert in Washington . The commiss then make a recommend within two to six month to the presid , who make the final decis on whether to impos tariff . The law allow govern offici , industri or union to file claim .Presid have almost alway follow the commission advic , although Presid Carter turn down a recommend for tariff on stainless steel flatwar in 1978 and Presid Georg H.W . Bush reject a recommend for tariff on extrud rubber thread in 1992 . The Offic of the Unit State Trade Repres declin to comment on the union content .China , which alreadi produc more than half the world aluminum , is expand capac even as it economi deceler . The result ha been a surg in export and fall price for aluminum .Chines export of aluminum jump more than 27 percent in the past two year , Chines custom figur show .A spokesman for the government-affili China Aluminum Associ , who gave hi famili name as Zeng , said aluminum increas use in high-spe railway equip , aerospac and electron justifi China expand product capac and rise export .Smelter in Canada and elsewher , have been displac in their tradit intern market , have step up shipment of raw aluminum to the Unit State . American import of raw aluminum from Canada , the biggest supplier , jump 10 percent by tonnag last year , Unit State custom data show .Other factor are influenc the aluminum trade . Alcoa , the main aluminum smelt compani in the Unit State , ha announc the close of a seri of smelt oper in the Unit State while reli more on product in Canada , Iceland and Saudi Arabia , as part of what it describ as an effort to improv overal effici . In a statement it said , Alcoa ha a long histori of cooper with the U.S. govern . We havent seen the petit and look forward to review it.Export to the Unit State are an import sourc of employ in China , and Chines offici have been increasingli concern about Donald J. Trump populist appeal for a tougher trade polici , includ a steep tariff on good from China . Financ minist Lou Jiwei of China told The Wall Street Journal dure a visit to Washington in the past week that impos such a tariff would violat World Trade Organ rule .', 'As fli goe , the onli thing more uncomfort than sit next to a coupl have a spat on an airplan , Mauri Rogoff learn , is sit between that coupl  especi when one partner prefer bare feet .Ms. Rogoff , who own a public relat firm with offic in New York and Florida and travel frequent , discov what a grow number of travel now know : The middl seat ha becom the third rail of fli  and it is get harder to avoid .As plane fli at record capac and new cabin configur squeez in ever more passeng , airlin are , intent or not , nudg flier into pay extra to avoid draw the proverbi short straw .I wa liter in the middl of their argument ,  Ms. Rogoff said . It wa just that awful. Her discomfort wa magnifi when the husband kick off hi shoe and cross hi leg , thrust a bare foot into Ms. Rogoff space .Her entreati with hi wife to swap seat fell on deaf ear . Of cours she had no interest becaus it wa middl , and becaus it wa a smelli foot ,  Ms. Rogoff said .For travel like Ms. Rogoff , airlin are make it harder than ever to avoid the middl seat base on luck alon .Southwest , which doe not assign seat , rais the price of an early-board pass to $ 15 from $ 12.50 last month . For those who do not pay up , it is a mad rush when onlin check-in open 24 hour befor the flight .Delta Air Lines Basic Economi fare , introduc last year , doe not allow seat assign to be made until after check-in  when higher-pay custom have had a chanc to claim window and aisl seat .American Airlin and Unit Airlin plan to introduc similar fare thi year . Neither would confirm whether select a seat would be one of the perk elimin , but one airlin analyst said it wa like , given the competit legaci airlin face from low-far carrier .It a way to compet ,  said Max Rayner , a partner at Hudson Cross , a consult firm in New York . If you want to go at premium time , there will be far fewer seat avail at the lower end of prices.Mr. Rayner suggest that thi shift in price model wasnt necessarili a bad thing , say it could be a boon for the most price-sensit custom . You can think of it actual as open up choic ,  he said . You just want basic transport  sure , here it is.But the crunch ha left some travel take extrem measur to avoid get stuck in the middl .Flier said they have offer fellow travel money or drink to switch seat , paid the fee to upgrad to a premium or exit row , feign ill or switch flight . Some travel even report buy two seat , just to have an empti one next to them .Dr. Sachin Shridharani , a plastic surgeon in New York , found himself on an overbook flight back from San Diego , and a middl seat wa the onli one avail .I told them Id be will to take anoth flight ,  he said . Ill pretti much do just about anyth to avoid sit in that notori , infam middl seat.The trade-off wa to wait in the airport for four hour , but Dr. Shridharani said it wa worth it so he could work on the way home . You cant have someon look over your shoulder ,  he said .In the end , analyst say , airlin are sell a form of real estat , but they are trade in squar inch , not squar feet .Peopl buy work space ; that realli what they buy on board ,  said Robert W.

Some of those configur may not give you enough room , for exampl , to take out a laptop and use it productively.One carrier , though , ha tri to address the issu . Frontier Airlin recent instal new seat on it Airbu A319 and A320 plane , with the middl seat about an inch wider than the window and aisl seat .But for most passeng , the tight squeez continu , and busi travel say count on their frequent-fli statu to avoid the middl seat is no longer a sure thing .You cant show up at the airport hope to talk your way into an upgrad ,  said Mark Jeffri , a corpor speaker and author . You dont see free seat anymore.Mr. Jeffri said he sometim buy two seat  a window or aisl , and a middl . It cheaper than buy a business- or first-class ticket on a legaci carrier , he said .We find that peopl will pay for premium economi or ani kind of seat assign if theyr travel solo to avoid the middl seat ,  said Julia Dougla , owner and presid of Jet Set World Travel in Chicago . Some travel will spend hundr of dollar more , she ad .Anoth approach is to appeal to anoth travel . There have been instanc where Iv bought someon an upgrad ,  said Michael Winston , who use to travel onc or twice a week while work in manag consult . At time , he said , he had resort to bargain with seatmat to avoid the middl seat .It is not an uncommon transact , frequent travel say , with cash , upgrad and cocktail all serv as form of currenc . But that is assum that the seat are avail .Last year , airlin capac again hit a record high , just shi of 85 percent , mean that a lot of flight are full .And that leav flight attend and travel agent act as de facto refere for game of midair music chair . The excus passeng use to avoid the middl seat are mani , they say .Long leg is alway one ,  Ms. Dougla said . She then list the most common complaint : claustrophobia , a need for frequent trip to the bathroom , flight-induc panic attack and a penchant for airsick .I dont know if ani of them are truli medic found ,  she said . I just think it anxieti about be in that middl seat.Of all the excus , genuin or exagger , the one that seem most effect is the threat of gastrointestin distress .William Bauer , who travel frequent as an execut at a manufactur of leather good , said that hint at a medic need for quick access to the bathroom usual prompt either gate agent or fellow passeng to make the switch for him .Make it clear that you need that aisl seat . Realli convey a compel sens of urgenc ,  he said .

The market had assum that a deal wa close when energi minist from member of the Organ of the Petroleum Export Countri as well as Russia met on Sunday .But the last-minut absenc of Iran , one of OPEC biggest produc , help scuttl ani deal after Saudi Arabia insist that the entir group particip in an agreement . Eager to increas oil output to it pre-sanct level , Iran had rule out a product freez and on the eve of the meet decid not attend the Doha gather .While the Doha meet might have help set the stage for a smooth recoveri in energi market , the road ahead promis to be much more bumpi , given the glut of oil in the system . Energi analyst now expect oil market to take longer to rebal , as product ebb more slowli and demand growth eventu catch up .Without a deal , uncertainti weigh on the market on Monday .Crude oil futur in New York fell 1.4 percent to $ 39.78 a barrel . In London , Brent crude futur fell almost 7 percent in earli trade but recov most of their loss by the end of the day . Monday declin were limit becaus of an oil workers strike in Kuwait that significantli crimp product there .The failur of the Doha meet highlight onc again that energi market  and particularli oil  remain larg hostag to the rivalri between Saudi Arabia and Iran for leadership and influenc in the Middl East .In what might be seen as a warn shot , the Saudi deputi crown princ , Moham Bin Salman , said ahead of the meet on Friday that Saudi Arabia could rais it crude output by more than a million barrel a day immedi .If thi is the start shot of a new price war , then we will not get the inventori draw we were project thi summer , and we will have build inventori in the fall instead , and then that will invit the risk of new price low ,  said Jan Stuart , global energi economist at Credit Suiss .Oil price collaps over the last year after major produc , led by Saudi Arabia , decid to flood the market and pump flat out to secur more market share . Ostens , the polici wa aim at push high-cost produc in the Unit State out of the market .But by produc full out , Saudi Arabia wa also hurt other oil produc within OPEC , includ Iran and also Russia , which is not an OPEC member . Both need higher price to balanc their budget .But the strategi backfir , and it led to a glut in the oil market that ha push price to their lowest level in year .The idea of a freez in product came up in Februari , as price fell below $ 30 a barrel , and initi help provok a rebound in the market . At the time , Saudi Arabia , Russia , Qatar and Venezuela had agre in principl on a freez but made it conting on particip by other major produc .After the meet , offici from oil-produc countri said they would work on a new agreement for the next OPEC meet , to be held in Vienna in June .At the same time , lower price are begin to bite . Last week , the Intern Energi Agenc said that global oil market would move close to balance in the second half of the year as lower price hurt produc outsid of OPEC .The global oil glut is expect to drop to 200,000 barrel a day in the last six month of the year , from 1.5 million in the first half , the agenc said in it monthli oil report releas on Thursday . The group found that outsid of OPEC , output will declin by the most sinc 1992 as the American shale oil boom falter .There is no doubt as to the direct of travel for the supply-demand balanc ,  accord to the energi advis to industri nation . There are sign that the much-anticip slide in product of light , tight oil in the U.S. is gather pace.For that reason , the outcom of the Doha meet might be moot , accord to a report by HSBC titl Much a-Doha about nothing.The agreement would onli have been of symbol signific , in our view , and would not have alter the suppli fundament ,  accord to the report . We continu to see clear evid that the market rebalanc is draw near and expect price to trend higher as the market tighten in the second half of the year.Still , much uncertainti remain , particularli what happen with Saudi Arabia and Iran . Princ Mohammed comment on Friday suggest that the current standoff between Saudi Arabia and Iran could last for sever more month , pose renew uncertainti on the direct of energi market .I dont suggest that we should produc more , but we can produc more ,  Princ Moham , who is the country defens minist and chairman of the Suprem Council of the Saudi Arabian Oil Compani , which set the country oil polici , said in an interview with Bloomberg News .Saudi Arabia produc about 10 million barrel a day in the first three month of the year . Analyst doubt how long the kingdom could be abl to ramp up product in a sustain manner and pump 11 million barrel a day , someth it ha never done befor .The weekend headlin will further support the alreadi high level of price volatil ,  analyst with Goldman Sach wrote in a report .', 'SEATTL  Amazon is introduc new option to subscrib to it Prime membership servic on a monthli basi , a chang that could make the company video servic a tougher competitor to Netflix .On Sunday even , the compani notifi visitor to it websit that it now offer two new Prime price plan , the first of which cost custom $ 8.99 a month to stream movi and televis show from a new video-onli version of it Prime servic .

Sinc the spring of 2010 , the time of the first Greek bailout , I.M.F . economist have been say that Greec would never be abl to pay back such a tremend amount of debt .Three economist , Pierre-Olivi Gourincha , Thoma Philippon and Dimitri Vayano , examin the histori of Greece debt boom and bust in a new paper .They contend that in term of money borrow and econom output lost , the Greek crisi ha far exceed even the classic emerg market bust in Latin America and Asia  mani of which were resolv via variou form of debt restructur .As a result , they conclud , the veri thought that Greec can pay it way out of thi mess without have it debt reduc in some way is fantasi .There is no exit for Greec without debt relief ,  Mr. Gourincha said .Part of the problem is that the fund role now is highli unorthodox . While the fund is owe $ 12 billion , it is not promis to lend ani new money thi year , which , at least in the view of the Greek , reduc it credibl . Isnt it hypocrit of the fund , some Greek offici say in privat , to push us so hard when it is not will to lend new money ? At least the European are promis to put more money on the tabl , they point out .Fund offici have respond : How can we be your enemi if we are the one pressur Europ to give you a break on your debt ?Matter have not been improv by the recent leak of a privat exchang between the fund lead negoti , Delia Velculescu , and the head of the fund European depart in Washington , Poul Thomsen .In the phone transcript , publish by WikiLeak , it wa suggest that the onli way to get an agreement would be to push Greec onc again to the precipic of default .I brought thi up with my Greek colleagu ,  said Jeroen Dijsselbloem , the financ minist from the Netherland , who is lead Europ in the talk with Greec . It an issu of trust  how can the I.M.F . do it work if they have to worri all the time about have their phone tap ? As to the matter of Greece debt , Mr. Dijsselbloem remain adam : It is not be discuss .While it remain most unlik that the I.M.F . would walk away from the talk , that such a step is even be suggest underscor how uncertain the negoti have becom .That is becaus Germani ha frequent said that it requir the I.M.F . to be an activ particip in the process . So if the fund doe not bless an agreement , Germani will be veri unlik to embrac it .Despit all the tension , negoti are continu . Greec , unlik in past year , sent it full team of negoti to Washington last Thursday to resum talk that had been temporarili suspend .They includ the financ minist , Euclid Tsakaloto ; the debt expert Stelio Papadopoulo ; the economi minist , Giorgo Stathaki ; and the Greek government longstand financi advis , Glenn Kim , an independ invest banker who previous work for Moeli and Lehman Brother .The crux of the talk ha long been Greece bloat pension program , which still pay out about 10 percent of G.D.P . annual . Fund offici have alway said that without signific pension cut , they could not approv ani new deal .Greec ha argu that , in depression-lik econom condit , Greek can not afford pension cut , especi when pension are now the onli breadwinn in mani famili .Under the labor minist , Georgio Katrougalo , the Greek govern is now push a plan that would freez current payout and cut futur one and that would increas contribut from employ .Whether that will be enough to win over the I.M.F . and , ultim , Europ regard the debt question remain to be seen .No amount of pension reform will make Greece debt sustain without debt relief ,  Mr. Thomsen , the fund European head and overs of the Greek talk , wrote in a recent blog post . And no amount of debt relief will make Greece pension system sustain without pension reforms.', 'SAN FRANCISCO  Yahoo chief execut , Marissa Mayer , will walk away with a $ 55 million sever packag if the company auction of it Internet oper culmin in a sale that oust her from her job .The payout , which wa disclos in a regulatori file on Friday with the Secur and Exchang Commiss , would consist of cash , stock award and other benefit if she is forc out within a year after a sale .Although Yahoo board is still evalu takeov offer , mani investor are bet that the compani will decid to sell it well-known brand and Internet busi , includ an email servic and news section focus on sport and financ .Ms. Mayer , a former Googl execut , ha been larg unsuccess in her effort to turn around Yahoo fortun .

Mr. Healey , a former mortgag trader at Goldman Sach , ha $ 40 million in back from Kohlberg Kravi Robert & Compani , the privat equiti giant .One reason the contract for deed market ha becom popular among invest firm is that under mani contract , buyer can be evict if they default on their loan .

Baird .', 'SAN FRANCISCO  For the last few year , LinkedIn , the profession social network compani , ha dole out increasingli larg amount of stock to pay it worker .In 2014 , LinkedIn paid employe $ 319 million in stock , or 14 percent of revenu ; in 2015 , that rose to $ 510 million , or 17 percent of revenu . At the time , those figur were larg met with shrug from Wall Street .Now that attitud may be chang .As LinkedIn prepar to report it latest quarterli earn next week , Wall Street is increasingli scrutin the number of stock grant that the compani pay employe  especi after LinkedIn project lower growth for thi year and it stock price ha fallen .The Silicon Valley company stock-bas compens provid addit reason to remain cautious on LinkedIn , Mark May , an Internet analyst at Citigroup , wrote in a research note .The issu is not limit to LinkedIn . With tech earn season kick off on Monday , investor are pay more attent to stock-bas compens at mani tech compani .Pay employe with stock is larg unquest when time are good , sinc the move theoret align the interest of the worker with compani perform . The practic is technic a corpor expens , but dure boom period , Wall Street typic focus on a company oper result that exclud that expens .Yet public tech compani have had a rockier time in the stock market thi year . That ha led investor to begin look more close at the qualiti of the companies financi result . The scrutini mean examin earn with stock-bas compens expens includ  and certain financi measur , like earn and margin , invari look wors when that expens is factor in .Tech compani stand out as some of the most gener giver of share to employe . While the median number of restrict share grant at Standard & Poor 1500 compani to execut and employe in 2014 equal 450,198 share , tech compani grant a median 798,000 share of restrict stock to worker , accord to data from Equilar , a research firm that provid data on execut , board and compens .As a result , there ha been a heighten investor focu on the level of stock-bas compens among the Internet compani ,  Mark Mahaney , an analyst at RBC Capit Market , wrote in a recent note .In an interview , Mr. Mahaney said stock-bas compens could distort the quality of a company earn and make them look stronger than they are.Mr. Mahaney ha identifi Twitter , LinkedIn , Yahoo and Alibaba as among the tech compani that are highli depend on stock to pay their employe . In a report , he wrote that Twitter stock-bas compens over the last two year account for 39 percent of the company revenu , on averag , the highest percentag of ani Internet compani .LinkedIn , whose share price is down about 48 percent thi year , did not respond to request for comment . Twitter , whose stock is down more than 20 percent thi year , also did not respond to a request for comment .Anoth tech compani that Wall Street analyst are examin for it stock-bas compens expens is Workday , which sell human resourc and financi manag softwar . The compani is expect to increas it stock compens about 48 percent in it 2017 fiscal year , which is faster than it revenu is project to grow , accord to Sarah Hindlian , an analyst at Macquari Group .In an illustr of how stock-bas compens expens can affect a company result , Ms. Hindlian say Workday margin are project to be around neg 25 percent for fiscal year 2017 . But when the company $ 370 million in stock-bas compens is exclud from result , it oper margin are much better , come in around zero .Workday heavi relianc on stock-bas compens ha been a factor in Ms. Hindlian project for the company share price . Last month , she forecast that Workday stock would trade at $ 49 , down from it current price of about $ 77 . She ha a sell recommend on the stock .Ms. Hindlian say that while it can be reason for compani to pay worker a lot in stock , the practic can becom scari when the stock start to fall . Particularli with softwar compani , you run the risk of lose your lead salespeopl , engin and develop when the stock fall , becaus employe feel like theyr get a pay cut ,  said Ms. Hindlian , who also rang the alarm on LinkedIn use of stock-bas compens over a year ago .Somewher along the way a manag team may feel pressur to increas their share price to avoid loss of employe ,  Ms. Hindlian said , which can ultim mean manag goal and sharehold interest becom misaligned.Workday declin to comment .When compani author addit share to pay employe and manag , that also creat dilut ,  or a decreas in how much of the compani a sharehold own when new stock is issu . That effect is start to push other on Wall Street to lower their price project for tech compani stock . Mr. May of Citigroup lower hi price target thi month on Googl , Facebook , Amazon , Netflix , eBay , Yahoo and Twitter to fulli captur the like ongo dilut from futur share grant as part of employe compens ,  he said .The increas scrutini of tech compani that reli heavili on stock to pay employe is just one of mani place where investor are take a harder look as market soften , said John Roe , a manag director at ISS Corpor Solut , a group that advis sharehold on corpor govern issu .He note that some sharehold had also submit propos ask compani to consid the impact of share buyback on earn , to figur out whether execut deliv better earn by improv perform or by reduc the number of share outstand .You see a brighter focu on certain practic when there is more volatil and market are go down ,  said Mr. Roe . The relianc on equiti compens is one of those thing that you might alway worri about , but recent event have amplifi that concern.', 'DOHA , Qatar  Offici from 18 oil-produc nation fail on Sunday to reach a deal to freez oil product at current level .The meet of offici , repres most of the Organ of the Petroleum Export Countri as well as Russia , had been intend to calm the market and convinc them that the two lead oil export , Russia and Saudi Arabia , were cooper . But with offici come up short on Sunday , the meet may end up be a blow to confid that could send oil price tumbl .A sharp fall in oil price could also feed into equiti price , which have recent tend to rise and fall along with oil price .Oil fell sharpli in earli trade on Monday in Asia , at one point drop nearli 6 percent to fall below $ 38 a barrel . Asian stock market were mix . Japanes share were down nearli 3 percent in morn trade , but stock across the rest of Asia saw more modest declin . Market in Shanghai and Hong Kong open around 1 percent lower .There will be a lot of peopl who they have disappoint ,  said Bill Farren-Pric , chief execut of Petroleum Polici Intellig , a British firm that advis hedg fund and other busi on the oil market . The oil export , he said , rais expectations.A major stumbl block in the talk appear to have been pressur from Saudi Arabia for Iran to particip in the freez , a measur to address the current global oversuppli of oil . The Iranian , who are rapidli increas product after the end of most sanction over their nuclear program , have refus to cap product at current low level .The oil produc seem to head into the meet full of confid that a deal to stabil oil market could be reach . In fact , a draft agreement call for a freez at Januari level through Octob wa circul Saturday .Talk of a potenti freez had alreadi help lift the oil market from their Januari low below $ 30 per barrel to about $ 43 per barrel for Brent crude . I think at least the discuss and expect around the Doha meet have contribut to higher price ,  Eric Lascel , chief economist at RBC Global Asset Manag , said in an interview befor the meet .A deal wa unlik to quickli chang the amount of oil on the market becaus most particip in the freez were pump at high level . And the failur is unlik to have much of an impact on suppli and demand balanc .What might limit the reaction is a strike on Sunday by Kuwaiti oil worker . That ha cut into the country oil product by what appear to be a substanti amount . You would expect the market to sell off but the downsid might be limit ,  said Mr. Farren-Pric , who wa observ the Doha meet .Analyst on Sunday also rais the question of how Saudi Arabia and the other countri could have schedul the meet if they knew it wa doom to failur . After all , the idea wa to calm the market , not roil them .Thi impli realli poor commun by the lead member of the group ,  particularli Saudi Arabia and Russia , said Richard Mallinson , an oil analyst at Energi Aspect , a London-bas market research firm . Whi even schedul thi meet if you did not have a compromis agre over Iran.The idea of a freez in product emerg in Februari , after oil price plung below $ 30 per barrel . OPEC member had been unabl to agre on product cut to manag the market . Instead , most member pump oil at full capac , tri to maxim revenu in the face of fall price .Saudi Arabia , Russia , Qatar and Venezuela agre in principl on a freez at a meet in Februari , but made it conting on particip by other major produc . The idea of a freez gain favor becaus it would involv littl or no sacrific for anyon .Analyst and some OPEC offici thought that a way could be found to accommod Iran desir to make up ground lost under sanction .Either they misread the Saudi or the kingdom leadership harden it posit . Saudi Arabia and Iran are bitter rival in the Middl East , clash over Yemen and Syria . The competit increasingli extend to oil , where a resurg Iran is vy with the Saudi for market share among custom in Asia and Europ .In the day befor thi meet , a mix messag emerg from Saudi Arabia . It oil offici , led by Ali al-Naimi , an 80-year-old veteran oil minist , evid sought accommod with other big produc , includ Iran , while , the deputi crown princ , Moham bin Salman , who ha becom the kingdom chief polici maker , indic that Saudi Arabia might not go along with a freez if Iran did not also compli .If all major produc dont freez product , we will not freez product ,  Princ Moham told Bloomberg News recent .The deal wa scupper by Saudi Arabia insist that languag requir that all OPEC member particip in the freez be insert in the draft . There wa littl question that Iran , which wa not repres at the meet , would agre . After lengthi negoti among Saudi Arabia , Russia , Venezuela and Qatar , which conven the meet , the talk broke up on Sunday .The meet conclud that we all need time for further consult ,  Qatar energi minist , Moham al-Sada , said at a news confer . He said that particip countri would consult among themselv and with others until the next OPEC meet , which is schedul for June in Vienna .Saudi tactic on the freez appear to be a part of a shift in the kingdom oil polici , analyst say .The Saudi , analyst say , increasingli seem to accept that they can no longer control oil price through OPEC , in part becaus the huge increas in suppli from the Unit State in recent year have undercut OPEC leverag .Thi is the new world of oil ,  said Jim Burkhard , head of oil market and scenario research at IH , who wa also observ the meet . The oil market is a reflect of the world . Power is more decentralized.The Saudi are shift instead toward produc whatev oil they need to suppli their grow network of domest refineri and petrochem plant and their expand bodi of oversea custom .Princ Moham , who ha author over the Saudi oil industri , warn that the kingdom could increas product by a million barrel per day in the come month if it chose .With low product cost , estim at $ 3.50 to $ 5 per barrel , Saudi Arabia can compet on price with ani produc . So can Russia , which can produc oil for about $ 4 per barrel , accord to IH . While Saudi Arabia and it Persian Gulf alli , Kuwait and the Unit Arab Emir , are feel the pinch of lower revenu , they are in far less immedi troubl than OPEC member like Venezuela and Algeria , analyst say .Some of the less well-off oil produc clearli want a deal in hope that it would rais price and revenu . Thi is someth that affect the whole oil industri whether you are in OPEC or not ,  Ecuador oil minist , Carlo Pareja Yannuzzelli , told report on Sunday .While plan are far from fulli delin , Princ Moham appear to be chart a more independ cours for the Saudi oil industri . For instanc , he ha said he plan a public list of the nation oil compani , Saudi Aramco , the world largest oil-produc compani . A public list might requir the compani to pay more attent to the requir of outsid investor than to other OPEC member .Princ Moham increasingli seem to see oil as a potenti polit instrument  an approach that Mr. Naimi eschew .There is a lot of chang happen in Riyadh ,  Mr. Mallinson said . Oil polici is becom less insul from politics.Some analyst specul that Mr. Naimi  who ha long been skeptic that other produc , includ Russia , would honor product ceil  is go along with the idea of a freez to help insul Saudi Arabia from critic .The Saudi might have been cover their back ,  said Paul Steven , an analyst at Chatham Hous , a London-bas research firm . They can say , We tried.Russia had reason to go along with a freez . Russia economi , which depend heavili on oil revenu , is in recess . The Kremlin desper for higher price is palpabl ; the countri is commit to two war , in Ukrain and Syria . At home , wage are be cut , bring sign of social unrest ahead of a parliamentari elect in Septemb .Russia energi minist , Alexand Novak , who attend the Doha meet , ha been a crucial support of a freez . A role assign to Mr. Novak wa to bring in Iran , but he ha fail so far .Russia and Saudi Arabia trade place for the top spot among oil produc . Russia ha been in the lead of late , pump 10.9 million barrel of oil a day in Januari compar with Saudi Arabia 10.2 million . But becaus of Russia larger popul and industri base , it consum more oil at home , leav Saudi Arabia the leader in export .Sinc the Soviet period , OPEC ha look on Russia as a freeload on price-boost product cut : Russia benefit but never join in .Analyst say that OPEC effort to involv Russia and other outsid underlin it diminish clout . Join with Russia is what is left for an organ that ha lost it core reason for be , at least for now and possibl for the longer term ,  said Bhushan Bahre , an OPEC analyst at the market research firm IH , who wa observ the meet .', 'All of thi , honestli , is one big magic trick.Those word , spoken by the director Jon Favreau , were meant to sum up the technolog wizardri on display in hi hyperrealist remak of The Jungl Book ,  which wa larg creat with comput . But Mr. Favreau could also have been describ the way Walt Disney Studio use market sleight of hand to fill seat on open weekend . The Jungl Book took in an astound $ 103.6 million in North America , accord to Disney .Studio hate to discuss their market for fear of come across as corpor version of Kaa , the slipperi Jungl Book python who hypnot prey . ( Trusssst in me. ) But movi  especi one as tricki as The Jungl Book ,  a styliz film base on a cartoon music , base on a classic book  do not sell themselv . Here are some of the trick that Disney , which declin to comment , use to move the mass :In August , Mr. Favreau bound onto a 7,800-seat arena at a Disney fan convent in Anaheim , Calif. , and show sneak-peek footag from hi film . He hobnob with three Jungl Book star on stage , includ Neel Sethi , who play the man-cub Mowgli . Thousand of movi poster were hand out .Thi wa the first market stunt for The Jungl Book ,  which cost roughli $ 175 million to make . By go to happi , peppi Disneyphil first , Disney ensur that the movie initi blast on social media would be a posit one .When anim talk in a movi , unless it a comedi , older moviego tend to skip it . Most of Mr. Favreau anim are not cartoonish and cuddli ( not by a long shot ) , but Disney could not reli on trailer and TV spot to convey that messag .So Disney use blogger and entertain news site to hammer home a point : Mr. Favreau use sophist filmmak techniqu to creat the anim charact .In part to make The Jungl Book appeal to a finicki high school crowd  older sibl tend to influenc younger brother and sister  Disney pack the first trailer with scari moment ( pounc panther , snarl tiger , stamped buffalo ) while hide the music number and keep Baloo goofier moment to a minimum .Star are anoth way to make adult pay attent . To elev The Jungl Book in the mind of grown-up , Disney in March circul dramat photograph that pair voic actor with their onscreen charact  Idri Elba with the tiger Shere Khan , Ben Kingsley with the panther Bagheera , Lupita Nyongo with the wolf Raksha .Gener speak , women and girl see Disney magic castl logo on a trailer and are pull closer . The opposit can be true with guy . So Disney aggress and repeatedli pitch The Jungl Book to male audienc .Commerci on ESPN portray the movi as come not from the studio that made Cinderella but from the studio that brought you Pirat of the Caribbean. An extend 3-D trailer for The Jungl Book wa attach to Star War : The Forc Awaken ,  which had an audienc that wa 58 percent male .And Disney roll out an action-ori trailer dure the Super Bowl .Studio market have learn that Hispan moviego tend to buy ticket in particularli larg group ; if you hook one famili member , you can get an exponenti result . To achiev that goal , Disney team with Univis for a five-week stunt that brought Jungl Book charact and clip to telenovela , talk show and sport coverag . Disney even built a tool to allow Univis person to appear in scene .If moviego believ that , they are more like to spend $ 3 to $ 5 more a ticket to see The Jungl Book in 3-D , which can lift opening-weekend sale consider . To emphas the scope and scale of thi movi , Disney introduc a mazelik Law of the Jungl websit in partnership with the female-lean Tumblr ; ran special promo at IMAX theater focus on the snake Kaa ; and creat a tour virtual-r experi and 360-degre Facebook video emphas the Avatar-lik world of it jungl .Variou corner of the Disney empir pitch in to promot The Jungl Book. A New Year Day stunt on the Disney Channel , for instanc , wa use to portray the film as one of the year first blockbust offer for famili and children .But the synergist heavi lift wa done by Disney theme park . Dure the jam-pack spring break week , park theater in Florida and California offer sneak-peek footag of the movi , with Mr. Favreau provid introduct .The mani ( mani ) theme park store that sell Disney merchandis had Jungl Book section . And Disney built photogen Jungl Book sand sculptur at it Anim Kingdom and Epcot park in Florida .', 'In 1951 , find specialti meat and chees could take some do if you live in small-town America and had no neighborhood deli .

Let me just take a moment to say I havent taken three week off work in a row sinc my last visit to the hospit . That Farhad sure know how to loung .Quentin : Farhad ha been away three week ? Wow , he miss like five new version of iTun .Mike : Inde . So , on with the week news !Microsoft decid to sue the govern over the gag order the Depart of Justic put on compani after theyv receiv user data by obtain a warrant .

The Financi Time report that BuzzFe miss big on it revenu target last year , and as a result it had to scale back it 2016 project drastic . That sound like a FAIL ,  but I am hardli inclin to LOL.Quentin : No LOL here , when you consid , too , that Mashabl also had a rebrand ,  and possibl also a pivot ,  seemingli away from news and analysi and toward video-centr lifestyl fun .It the kind of fun that begin with a bunch of report get the sack .

We had the bot revolut . We had antenna connect the unconnect . It all sort of smoke and mirror right now , but Facebook at least seem to be make thi real much faster than anyon would have ever thought .I mean , Zuck had guy on stage take selfi insid a virtual realiti environ  the most harrow part of which wa that there is such a thing as a V.R . selfi stick.But I digress . Facebook seem pretti optimist on thi futur . Are you ?Quentin : Thi is optim with a lot of focu , too . Facebook may have had some smoke , but it held the mirror up to itself : Facebook is now send 60 billion messag a day , three time mobil phone SM traffic at it peak . Peopl are watch hour of video a day , and the camera will make cheap virtual realiti video a likelihood . I think Zuck purpos told the world precis where he want to be in 10 year so the develop can get him there in seven . Googl and Microsoft befor him use outsid develop to get huge  it that playbook again .Mike : Im particularli interest in the technolog they will use to make me not look like a complet goober while Im use virtual realiti .

Facebook is even hire anthropologist to figur out the right bodi languag of avatar . There must be someth there .Mike : Yeah , I guess .What I wa told by someon who know Zuck well is that he is particularli driven to own the next platform ,  and that he believ virtual realiti is it .Look at the smartphon , the unquestion domin platform of contemporari societi , for instanc . Appl and Googl have divvi up that platform all to themselv , and it ha been unbeliev lucr for their respect busi . Amazon , Microsoft , even Facebook all tri  and fail  to compet for a measli third-plac seat at the tabl . That chanc is gonezo .So what doe Zuck do ? He goe for what he think the next platform will be and tri to own it befor anyon realli even use it . It will take year to seed , and mani factor for it to go mainstream . But I think he probabl right in that it go to be similar to how we use consum tech today  perhap it will becom our next consol , like the Xbox , if not a more integr part of our daili live , like the smartphon .Quentin : It will take year , but I think that wa whi he deliv a keynot that wa pretti precis about the next 10 year , then back it up with stuff in artifici intellig , network and devic that show where they are focus .

Yet it is the decis about those item that often caus problem in a famili .Team of highli paid lawyer and advis can divid the most complex estat among heir of vari age from differ marriag in a way that is equit . But if they are ask to decid who get the tarnish tea servic in the dine room , they are apt to bow out and wish you good luck .There arent ani magic solut ,  said Marlen Stum , a professor in the famili social scienc depart at the Univers of Minnesota and author of Who Get Grandma Yellow Pie Plate ? Her book offer six major principl to help peopl divid asset without tear apart their famili . The process start with realli recogn how it not simpl or trivial but laden with emot ,  she said .Some of the principl should be obviou , like recogn that item have differ mean to differ peopl , that divis like thi come at emot time and that no one in the famili realli know the best way to do thi .But at the core of Ms. Stum work is the concept of what fair mean and an acknowledg that conflict will happen but can be manag .Sinc fair mean differ thing to differ peopl , Ms. Stum suggest creat a process , whether it be draw lot , let peopl pick in birth order or devis someth els . What import is that the process is follow .Even if your realli irrit that one sibl got what you realli want , if you bought into the process , your probabl go to buy into that outcom as oppos to the sibl who come in and clean out the hous ,  she said .Parent who think that they can wait or that their children will sort out everyth without guidanc from them are gener not be realist , said John A. Warnick , an estat lawyer and the founder of the Purpos Plan Institut .I ask parent to think just for a second what it would be like on Christma morn if your children ran downstair and there were all of these present , bright and shine , big and small , but with no name tag on them ,  he said . Can you imagin the free-for-al that would ensu ? Do noth and believ that your children will divid thing without quarrel , he said , will not work .

Her sister got more thing , but that did not bother Ms. Bennett .It wa a good deal for her ,  she said . It wa a great deal for me becaus I didnt have to talk to someon who caus me so much emot trauma . It wa a blind , fair split . If she had known what I want , she would have priorit it to spite me.David MacMahan , an entrepreneur and the creator of FairSplit , said he design tool for three contenti time in a famili : death , divorc and downsiz . In ani of these situat , the kind of gamesmanship that Ms. Bennett allud to can be minim , if not avoid , by limit the person contact and put the select process onlin , he said .Parent never know what import to the kid ,  he said . I it dad World War II medal ? We combin emot valu and monetari valu here.In creat the tool , he said , he drew on hi own experi in two pain divis of item  after hi father death and hi own divorc .There almost alway a section in a will say divid everyth els equal among the kid ,  he said . That section tear famili apart . Kid fight so much.The tool use select round so that each child or grandchild can pick the thing they want , assign more point to thing they covet . Thi system can be set up to allow certain famili member to go befor other  say children befor stepchildren  or to allow heir to pick up to a certain number of item in each round use a system of 500 point to bid for them .The system also track the items monetari valu , determin by an apprais , so the select can be calcul into the overal split of financi and real estat asset . So if I put all 500 point on Dad old Bentley , it goe to monetari valu , too ,  he said .Juli Hall , an estat expert special in person properti , said that whether the divis is done onlin , in a room or through costli lawyer , what is need is gracious .The decis those of us who are left behind make realli should honor the love one who die ,  she said . It requir give and take.To that end , she suggest that peopl alway bring in an apprais .

Then , the valu wa equal at death with other asset from the estate.Of cours , such talk forc peopl to confront the inevit of death .

And while the Senat and the Hous bill still differ a bit , one like result is go to be thi : The carrier are go to have to refund the fee you pay when your luggag isnt on your flight and you have to wait a long time to get it .Refund those fee may not seem like a big deal , but airlin in the Unit State took in about $ 3 billion in fee for check luggag last year . So plenti is at stake . And if youv ever tri to get your money back after an airlin botch it baggag deliveri , as I did recent , your acut awar of the follow fact : Ani attempt to reason with the airlin begin with the discoveri that it may have declar all baggag fee nonrefund in nearli everi circumst . A refund , if you get one , may come in the form of a voucher that requir you to fli that carrier again  and to rememb to use it . If you disput the charg with your credit card compani , you may run into resist .While the bill contain other improv for travel famili , peopl in wheelchair and other , those baggag fee are the one that airlin have been charg for a longer time and are particularli noxiou . If the bag doesnt come spin around the carousel , you shouldnt have to pay , right ?Well , the airlin argu that they alon should get to answer that question . Their trade group , Airlin for America , contend that the bill , which ha bipartisan support , overreach . Sinc 1990 , the industri ha more than halv it rate of mishandl bag , which is now at 3.24 per 1,000 piec of check luggag , down from 6.84 , accord to Vaughn Jen , a spokesman . Custom servic decis are best left to the dedic airlin employe who interact with and receiv feedback from their custom everi day  not govern ,  he said .Those decis have led to the follow result : In just a decad , the major American airlin have gone from take in littl in  la cart fee for thing like baggag , earli board and premium seat , to rake in $ 7.4 billion in 2015 alon , accord to a studi by the travel industri firm IdeaWork and CarTrawl .A healthi airlin industri is a great thing . Still , are all these fee just a nake grab for profit , or mere an attempt to have passeng pay for onli the servic that they are actual use ?And if you did not get what you paid for , you ought to be persist in your attempt to get the money back . Here how the process break down  and I mean that in everi sens of the term .HAGGL WITH THE AIRLIN In Decemb , my famili and I check some bag on a domest Delta Air Line flight and did not get them back until 30 hour later . It seem as if a refund wa in order , but it took some effort to get Delta agent to even acknowledg that there wa a way to request one .On it onlin form , Delta say it may elect to give you a rebate if 12 hour pass between the time you report the wayward bag and your receiv them . To start that process , Delta want ticket number , baggag claim number and the file refer number it give you when your bag dont show up . You should have your paperwork in order .And that rebat ?  If Delta grant one , youll get a voucher for futur use on Delta . You know , the same airlin that your super annoy with for have left you with just your dirti winter cloth in a warm climat with no toothpast and an infant to cloth . ( We eventu bought more cloth , and Delta reimburs us in full . At least we werent on Spirit , which reserv the right to request that you return the thing you bought . )You may forget you have that voucher , even if you are will to fli Delta again . But youd better not forget , becaus it expir in a year . Delta would not disclos the percentag of passeng who end up use these voucher . The airlin doe give member of it frequent flier program 2,500 frequent flier mile if they have to wait more than 20 minut at the carousel after a domest flight , but onli if they know to ask for it via anoth onlin form and do so within three day .DISPUT FEE WITH YOUR CARD COMPANi Have given Delta an opportun to fix the problem onli to find that I could not get my money back , I call up American Express , my credit card issuer , to disput the baggag fee charg . The disput process can be an incred power tool for aggriev consum , and you can learn more about it in my 2013 column on the topic .When I got a repres on the phone , howev , she inform me that I wa not allow to disput thi fee . Whi not ? Becaus of an agreement that the airlin ha with American Express , she said .Thi seem unfair , but Id heard similar report from consum over the year about other card compani . Accord to Molli Faust , a spokeswoman for American Express , the compani doesnt have much flexibl , given how airlin set up the fee in the first place . In the so-cal contract of carriag , the airlin can and do declar mani fee nonrefund . When that happen , and the servic is render , accord to Ms. Faust , American Express tri to educ cardhold about how the fee rule work and gener wont be abl to get them a refund .Despit the insist of my American Express repres on the phone , Delta contract of carriag doe not describ it baggag fee as nonrefund , though those for Unit , Spirit and American do . Delta doe , howev , describ other fee thi way . Perhap that whi , after a lot of badger from me , the American Express phone repres eventu file my disput after all . Ultim , it wa success . Most peopl would not be that persist , though .Spokeswomen for Capit One , JPMorgan Chase and Citibank all said that they allow airlin fee disput . If youv had a differ experi , pleas let me know in the comment .TURN TO WASHINGTON Depend on what happen to the new legisl , it possibl that some of the bag fee angst will go away . The Senat version of the bill call for airlin to automat refund the baggag fee when travel do not get their luggag within six hour of their arriv on a domest flight or 12 hour on an intern one . The Hous version give a 24-hour deadlin , and the deliveri of the refund would not be automat .Both passag are pretti gener to the airlin . Baggag servic use to be free . Now that it gener isnt , should they realli get a free pass if your bag come on the next flight four hour later and you have to deal with the logist of make sure they get to you ?Still , the automat natur of the Senat propos is a big deal . If it doe becom automat , it will no longer be your respons to type number into web form . Instead , the refund would just happen . Also , it would be an actual refund on your card statement . Staff member work on the bill say that voucher will not be allow . Good riddanc .MEANWHIL , MAKE THESE MOVE It will probabl be a year or two befor these provis take effect . So while your wait , you could tri a coupl of thing to avoid baggag fee if check your luggag is a necess .First , fli Southwest . It doesnt charg fee for the first two check bag . If you have elit statu on an airlin , you can gener avoid fee that way , and mani carrier have credit card-issu partner that in exchang for the card overal annual fee , will offer free luggag check of some sort .But if your stuck pay fee on a carrier that give you grief when the bag dont come on time , disput those charg and disput them often . Anoth thing that get the carrier attent is your file a complaint with the Depart of Transport .If enough of us protest just onc or twice a year , the airlin may get so sick of respond that they will autom refund , whether our elect repres forc them to or not .', 'EVEN though taxpay have a few extra day thi year to file their feder incom tax return , some still wont make the deadlin .

So filer should do their best to calcul ani tax due and pay it .If you cant pay what you owe , Ms. Labant said , pay what you can , then contact the I.R. . to discuss an instal plan for the balanc . Dont wait until you hear from the agenc , she said .

Among the support of the set-top box propos are compani like Googl , Amazon and Appl , which are eager to establish a broader foothold in the TV market .An industri that had previous been consid untouch  the cabl guy  is now subject to critic from the presid ,  said Susan Crawford , a Harvard Law School professor who is a former aid to Mr. Obama . Thi is like weigh in against Big Tobacco or Big Pharma.Cabl industri leader lash out at Mr. Obama , argu that he wa reward polit friend and benefactor like those at Googl , and undermin the independ of the F.C.C .Jim Cicconi , a senior execut vice presid at AT & T ; , said the president move wa aim at muscl Democrat commission to support the Googl proposal.The administr can comment on ani propos by the F.C.C. , an independ agenc , but it doe so sparingli , and it is rare for the presid himself to speak out on a pend matter . In thi case , hi advis said he felt that the issu merit hi involv becaus of the broad impact the chang could have on the cabl market , one that touch mani American household .The F.C.C . propos would allow subscrib to choos and buy the devic they use to view televis program , instead of leas the box from their cabl compani at an averag annual cost of $ 231 . The agenc approv the plan in Februari , start a 60-day comment period that close in a week .In comment submit on Friday , the Nation Telecommun and Inform Administr , part of the Commerc Depart , urg the F.C.C . to take a measur and balanced approach to inject competit into the set-top box market , includ enabl altern provid to provid their own user interfac , as well as other featur .In a blog post , Jason Furman , the chairman of Mr. Obama Council of Econom Advis , and Jeffrey D.

Mr. Furman said White Hous offici had alreadi notifi the agenc of the come call for recommend , so some of the regul were alreadi underway .The push announc on Friday is in line with Mr. Obama promis in hi State of the Union address thi year to find way to help worker , small busi and entrepreneur .

While advoc promis that the design of new insur market would transform the way consum buy health insur , critic warn that the new market would never succeed . Reed Abelson and Margot Sanger-Katz have had front-row seat to the debat , and the two report took a few minut to discuss when  and if  the market would stabil .Margot : It been a few week of bad news about the Obamacar marketplac . On Friday , we learn that UnitedHealth ha decid to pull out of Obamacar marketplac in two state . The week befor , the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Associ put out a paper offer not-too-subtl hint that some member were lose money . Reed , you wrote recent about how surpris stasi in the employ insur market mean we can look forward to much smaller Obamacar marketplac than most peopl expect when the health law pass . And the parad of struggl start-up insur compani ha extend to Maine Commun Health Option , one of the co-op that had long been held up as one of the most success . Health insur need to submit their rate to regul in the next few week  or decid to exit market . Should we be worri about a health insur apocalyps ?Reed : I think peopl have a tendenc to catastroph , especi when it come to Obamacar . UnitedHealth , which is one of the nation largest health insur , ha onli reluctantli embrac the new market , and the compani is alway held up as an exampl of whi the sky is fall and whi Obamacar is go to crash and burn : If Unit cant make it , no one can .Unit ha onli a small fraction of the individu market , but some of the Blue are also struggl . What is most troubl is the fact that mani insur are lose money . You may not sympath much with the insur compani  and no one doe  but they have to make enough money to pay claim . Do you think those loss are temporari  or a sign that the market is fundament unstabl and potenti unsustain ?Margot : I think some of both . It seem clear that some insur just made price mistak . Id includ a lot of the nonprofit co-op plan that have gone belli up in that categori . Unit may fall in that categori , too , in some place . That doesnt seem to me like a perman problem . If everyon price too low , they can just rais their price in futur year , and itll be O.K . That not great for middle-class peopl who pay their own premium , but most peopl in the exchang wont notic a differ becaus of the way the subsidi work .These market also turn out to be more complic than some insur expect . Some regulatori choic didnt go their way . And it doe look as if more custom than you might expect are stay enrol in plan for onli part of the year , which make it hard for the insur to collect premium . But I think theyll probabl figur it out .Reed : But isnt it a viciou cycl ? The big player wont stay in market unless they can attract enough custom to make it worth their while . Those who say Obamacar is doom argu that the premium are just too high for peopl who dont qualifi for a subsidi . If you are insur and rel healthi , you may not feel as if the coverag is a good deal . The deduct are steep , mean you end up pay for a lot of your care befor you see the first dollar of coverag , and you cant alway see your choic of doctor .The result is that the market could be too small and therefor too volatil to attract mainstream insur like Unit .How do you solv that ?Margot : Well , it seem clear that you need some competit in everi market to keep price low . But mayb we dont need the big carrier to play everywher . As you note , Unit bare show up in the exchang in the first place , and custom in most market still have a lot of choic . The Medicaid-manag care plan seem to be have some success in thi market , so mayb they will be a big part of the exchang mix .I also think it worth look at the state where thing are go well and the insur are make money : California , Vermont , Washington . Those state exchang made some differ regulatori choic earli on that got more peopl into the new market right away , so their market stabil more quickli .Reed : Your right that you may not need the establish player for the market to work . The market may not look the way we thought it would , with the same insur and same characterist as the employ market . But one of the reason insur are leav is becaus of the market instabl . There tremend churn in thi market , with most peopl switch plan everi year to tri to find a cheaper altern .Im not sure I know what the busi model is for an insur , if the expect is that your go to keep your custom for onli a year . It make achiev long-term goal like keep peopl healthier and focus on prevent measur much harder becaus there may be no payoff for the insur .Margot : Ye , I think thi is one of the contradict of the Afford Care Act design . The whole idea wa that competit between the insur compani would help to hold down price , the way it doe for , say , electron or groceri . In order for that system to work , you need peopl to actual switch plan if their plan start charg more than the competit . The fact that peopl are actual switch seem like a sign that thi market is function as it wa design . But as you point out , all that churn sure make it hard for an insur to make money by invest in it customers long-term health . But the individu market , pre-Obamacar , also had a lot of churn .Reed : Ye , there alway been churn , but the insur got pretti good at figur out which peopl they want to insur by turn away the peopl who were most like to cost them the most money . They definit figur out how to make money .It easier to smooth all of thi out if you insur more peopl . Do you think there opportun to see the market increas in size ? I know insur in the earli year suffer when some state allow peopl to keep their exist plan . Those plan that were grandmoth , as it is call .Margot : My sens from talk to folk in the industri is that the grandmoth plan realli wreck their earli calcul . The Obama administr , respond to a polit freakout about peopl whose plan were get cancel in 2014 , let state keep them for a few more year . The result wa that healthi peopl tend to hold onto their old , cheaper plan , while sick peopl went to the exchang . You can see how that might make the exchang market unprofit for new entrant .I do think the market size is a bit of a chicken-or-egg question . Your stori last week on stabil in the employ market did such a good job of lay thi out . Everyon ( includ the Congression Budget Offic ) expect that employ would start drop coverag onc the marketplac were up and run . That didnt happen . It mean that Obamacar ha been much less disrupt to the statu quo than mani peopl thought . But it also mean that the exchang market are smaller and probabl more expens than peopl thought , too . If price keep go up , mayb theyll never grow much . It certainli seem like everyon is cut down their long-term estim for exchang enrol .Reed : The other possibl would be to expand the pool of peopl who qualifi for subsidi . Is that a polit nonstart ?Margot : It such an interest question . Everi time I write a stori about the health law , I get comment and email from peopl just abov the incom cutoff for subsidi . These are the peopl who have been most hurt by the health law . Plan on the exchang are just realli expens for them , and often come with big deduct , too . And if premium keep rise , theyll keep get squeez . Analyst from the Urban Institut have done the math and found that some of them are pay more than 25 percent of their incom on health care now . Still , it is aw hard to imagin Congress approv massiv new spend to make Obamacar more gener . Hillari Clinton ha some propos about afford , but they dont includ expand subsidi .Reed : One of the strength of the law , and it main weak , is it emphasi on keep the statu quo . While Presid Obama may have overpromis when he said you can keep your plan if you like it , the insur isnt radic differ . The onli way compani can seem to bring down price is by narrow network of hospit and doctor or hike deduct . While Berni Sander seem to be offer the most dramat chang by propos that everyon switch to a govern plan like Medicar , Im still look for a market respons  some real chang in how care is deliv that is much less expens or at least more effect .Margot : Thi is the thing I say whenev anyon ask me what I think about the health law . It basic bake in all of the complex and dysfunct of the pre-exist American health care system .Reed : Wer head into the season when insur and state regul start talk about next year . Ani thought on what we might expect ?Margot : Im expect them to ask for rate increas ! The insur compani are do everyth they can to broadcast their intent to charg more . There are reason we should expect the plan to do so even if the market were alreadi stabl . Some of the earli training-wheel program set up by the law expir , which mean the plan have to pay out more claim for realli expens patient . Last week , I heard Peter Lee , who run Cover California , the most stabl market of all , say he expect bigger rate hike next year than the last two . The Depart of Health and Human Servic ha even signal it expect rate to go up . Thi week , it put out a research paper to remind the public that request to hike rate dont alway matter for individu consum .What will you be keep your eye open for to shape your think about how these market will do long term ?Reed : We should keep watch for the exit .But we should also look at what happen with some of the newer player , like Oscar , the for-profit compani in New York that ha a lot of capit . And I know that some of the big health system  Im think of anoth hometown player , Northwel Health , formerli North Shore-LIJ Health System  have start offer plan . Some of these system , like Northwel , have had some success in attract custom and think they can make a go of it .And we should watch the Depart of Justic . If it approv some of those big health insur merger like Anthem and Cigna and Aetna and Humana , my guess is those compani will not be leav the marketplac anytim soon .', 'HONG KONG  China growth rate slow as expect in the first three month of the year , but a notabl pickup in debt-driven industri activ last month probabl cushion the slowdown .Growth slow to 6.7 percent in the first quarter compar with a year earlier , accord to offici data releas on Friday morn in Beij .

Some of the three dozen or so potenti suitor have even question what is truli for sale .But sever big compani are expect to place bid for Yahoo anyway , accord to peopl brief on the matter . Verizon Commun , which ha publicli express interest in buy Yahoo core Internet busi and merg it with it AOL divis , plan to press forward with a bid , some of these peopl said .The Daili Mail , a British tabloid newspap and websit , said publicli that it had consid join with potenti investor , includ one or more privat equiti firm , for a bid . And the privat equiti firm TPG plan to make a bid in the first round on it own , accord to a person brief on the matter .Yet other huge compani plan to sit out the bid . Googl , which compet with Yahoo on search and display advertis and ha a search partnership with the compani , consid make an offer , but is unlik to proceed becaus it fear ani deal would draw stiff antitrust scrutini , accord to peopl brief on the company think .Other notabl busi , includ AT & T ; , CB and the invest firm Silver Lake , Kohlberg Kravi Robert and Gener Atlant , are unlik to bid , accord to other brief on their plan . And SoftBank , the Japanes telecommun giant that control Yahoo Japan , doe not plan to bid despit press report to the contrari .A 90-slide present shown to potenti Yahoo bidder is dens with figur , but even peopl familiar with the company oper have struggl to make sens of them . At the same time , Yahoo devot just a coupl of slide to import strategi , like it costli Hail Mari project to creat an entir new mobil search experi to leapfrog competitor like Googl , Appl and Amazon .Repres of Verizon , Googl , AT & T ; and CB declin to comment . A Yahoo spokeswoman also declin to comment on the sale process .Marissa Mayer , Yahoo chief execut , is expect to face question about the bid on Tuesday , when the compani report it latest quarterli earn . The report should offer a window into how Yahoo is weather the upheav caus by the layoff of 15 percent of it work forc announc in Februari . The total valu of Yahoo share is now about $ 35 billion .The compani may also disclos sale of patent and real estat , which it began shop a coupl of month ago in the hope of rais $ 1 billion to $ 3 billion .One reason for Yahoo reluct to share inform may be that the busi is wors than the compani ha publicli disclos . That ha ad to confus regard the intent of a board of director that , just a few month ago , publicli said it had no intent of sell .Ms. Mayer ha often said she want to make Yahoo servic a daili habit for Internet user . But after nearli four year of effort , onli about 10 percent of the one billion monthli visitor to Yahoo site return everi day , suggest littl attach to the brand , accord to peopl who have seen confidenti intern data . At Facebook , by comparison , 65 percent of user visit daili .Yahoo is in a difficult posit . Ms. Mayer four-year turnaround effort ha fail to deliv signific improv at a compani that ha been in declin for a decad . Ms. Mayer argu that she is turn the tide with new invest in area like video and nativ advertis .Activist investor , led by the Starboard Valu hedg fund , have run out of patienc and are press the board to sell the core busi , separ it from the company far more valuabl invest stake in Alibaba , China lead e-commerc compani , and Yahoo Japan , a separ , publicli trade compani .Yahoo board , which spent more than a year work on other plan to separ the invest stake , reluctantli agre to explor a sale of all or part of the compani and hire three invest bank firm to run the process . Starboard ha formal threaten a proxi fight to replac the entir board at the next sharehold meet if the director do not follow through on a sale .Ms. Mayer ha publicli laid out a path for an independ Yahoo and made the case to potenti bidder that they should retain her as chief to carri out the plan .Abandon previou foray into video and digit magazin , Ms. Mayer , who formerli head search at Googl , is now focus on return Yahoo to it glori day as a search engin . Although comScor say that Yahoo is current the No . 3 player in desktop search , behind Googl and Microsoft , Ms. Mayer argu that Yahoo can leap ahead through a complet reimagin of mobil search.Ms. Mayer ha assign about 1,000 peopl to search product , or about 10 percent of the company staff , accord to peopl brief on the busi . The mobil effort , code-nam Project Index , ha offici been underway for two year and aim to creat a search tool similar to Googl Now on Android phone , Apple Siri , Microsoft Cortana and Amazon Alexa .But the team ha littl to show for it work , and mani at Yahoo wonder whether it is a hopeless quest . Industri expert as well as Yahoo insid say that without the locat and person data that Appl and Googl have , Yahoo will have a difficult time predict what peopl want with enough accuraci to get them to switch from other servic .There is a massiv opportun for mobil search ,  said Keith Raboi , a partner at Khosla Ventur , who invest in search start-up . But I dont think Yahoo ha the core asset or skill you would need to succeed or thrive right now.A Yahoo spokesman said that the compani wa explor mani search idea , includ the use of softwar bot that would fetch inform on behalf of user .Ms. Mayer vagu plan for revers Yahoo declin , along with the lack of disclosur about the company financ , have made prospect bidder nervou .Though sever privat equiti firm have been look at the compani , peopl involv in the bid process said that they were unlik to prevail against a determin corpor buyer .Verizon is view by analyst as the lead bidder for Yahoo , but it like offer come despit trepid among it execut , accord to the peopl brief on the bid .Verizon is still struggl to digest it $ 4.4 billion acquisit last year of AOL , and some execut worri that buy Yahoo would simpli be doubl down on integr troubl .Verizon could certainli combin the content properti and ad product and network run by Yahoo and AOL .The compani , with more than 112 million cellphon custom on top of it landlin Internet subscrib , would have the abil to preinstal Yahoo servic and distribut them wide .Howev , the contract govern Appl iPhon and phone run Google Android oper system gener restrict what phone carrier can do to promot altern for major servic like search and email . So Yahoo would still need to build product good enough to persuad peopl to switch .Wall Street is hope for a quick sale , to anybodi , at ani reason price .We continu to believ that one of the greatest risk in the stock is the core be a melt ice cube ,  as a prolong sale process draw on , creat question for employe , advertis and partner ,  wrote Robert Peck , an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey , on Wednesday .', 'Col Allan , the longtim editor in chief of The New York Post , announc on Thursday that he would retir at the end of the month after 42 year at the News Corpor , the publication owner .It ha been an enorm privileg to edit thi great paper ,  Mr. Allan , 62 , said in a statement .

Hi job , especi in the last year or so of Bear exist , wa to make sure the compani could financ itself on a daili basi in the short-term debt market . While Bear had about $ 18 billion in cash on it balanc sheet , it need more than $ 75 billion in cash on a daili basi to keep oper . For year , make sure that amount wa on hand had been a perfunctori , check-the-box assign .That all chang in the summer of 2007 , when two Bear Stearns-rel hedg fund collaps and Bear liquid them . Short-term lender began to question the judgment of Bear manag , and Mr. Friedman wa on the front line of gaug how the market view the firm as a credit risk .

He apolog and said he had been regret what he told me two year earlier .But a batch of Bear-rel email from the crisi era that becam public through a sharehold lawsuit and were sent to me by the investig report Teri Buhl rais question about which of Mr. Friedman statement more close reflect the realiti of what wa go on at Bear Stearn .The email show Mr. Friedman concern about the firm liquid began in earnest in June 2007 , just as the two hedg fund were be shutter and as the firm wa get readi to announc it second-quart earn . They also show how sensit Bear execut were to outsid percept of the firm .On June 25 , Timothi Green , the co-head of fix incom at Bear , email Mr. Friedman about the danger of trader use Bear balanc sheet to trade for custom . We are be veri care not to signal ani hint of liquid distress ,  he wrote .

We need to creat more liquid ASAP ,  said Sam Molinaro , Bear chief financi offic , in an email to Michael Minik , anoth senior Bear execut , that day .But liquid remain a major problem .

There wa also a signific dispute with State Street Bank over the valuat of the collater back it $ 1 billion loan to Bear , and it clear that what theyd most like is to simpli pull it.On Dec. 3 , 2007 , Mr. Friedman note in an email to execut in the fixed-incom divis that the firm wa start to see some signific pullback in funding and lost close to $ 2 billion in cash in one day . It get ugli out there ,  he wrote .In a Dec. 15 memo to Thoma Marano , the other co-head of fix incom , Mr. Friedman said he worri that anoth $ 10 billion to $ 30 billion of short-term fund would be pull if and when Moody Investor Servic downgrad the firm as he expect it would ( and which it did five day later ) . We will also effect be out of the deriv busi  equiti , rate and credit  sinc we alreadi have firm refus our name and mani more will refus us then ,  he wrote . Either way , wer dead , whether from lack of cash or lack of customers.In the same email , Mr. Friedmann worri that Bear employe would soon recogn the realiti that Bear might well be out of busi . Face with a lean year for compens and the prospect of effect wind down the firm over the next quarter , how do they respond ?  he ask , rhetor . I think we all know : Ani that can find anoth place to work will do so . So well be aliv in the way that a patient on life support is aliv , hope for a miracle.He then ask Mr. Marano whi Bear execut committe had fail to understand the serious of the firm predica . Beat the hell out of me ,  Mr. Friedman wrote . He ad that Robert Upton , the treasur , had spoken to Mr. Molinaro , the chief financi offic , a dozen time but had been rebuffed. Mr. Friedman wrote that he had spoken over and over with Steven Begleit , the head of corpor strategi , and been told that no one believ thing are that urgent. Mr. Friedman wonder if the execut committe wa confusing rais new equiti with have suffici fund to run the busi . Rais new capit wont fix the world around us ,  he conclud in the email , just three month befor the firm demis .

And the factor that led to such rampant deal make last year  slower growth and cheap financ  have not gone away .It just may be the smaller compani that feel more confid in pull the trigger .I wouldnt call it a day yet on the M. & A . ; wave ,  said Mr. Profusek of Jone Day .', 'BRIXHAM , England  Mike Walker , a retir fisherman here , sum up what mani in thi southern English port town think of the European Union .Britain membership in the 28-nation union ha encourag Franc , Spain , the Netherland and the rest of them lot to come rape our water ,  Mr. Walker said .Other here might use less extrem languag . But Mr. Walker opinion reson in thi town of 17,000 . And it signal a wider British discomfort with the European Union befor the countri vote in a June 23 referendum on whether to quit the union .Whether their grievanc involv fish , immigr or meddlesom rule , mani Briton resent what they view as interfer by European institut and bureaucrat base in Brussel .In the case of Brixham , England largest commerci fish port , mani here want Britain to regain control of the water within 200 mile of shore . Those fish ground are now manag by Brussel and pack with European vessel that trawl with net and sometim scrape the seab .Worldwid , most sovereign countri , includ the Unit State and Canada , have dominion over fish right within the 200-mile limit . Brixham fishermen argu that a Britain free of the European Union oversight could banish foreign vessel and give job back to the British .I definit want out ,  said Michael Sharp , anoth fisherman , cross hi arm defiantli . All those war wev had with Franc , Germani  all the rest of them sinc God know when , sinc Jesu wa a lad  wer never go to get on with them , are we ? Nationwid , public opinion poll indic the vote on a British exit , Brexit , as it is known , will be too close to call . And even in the fish industri , Brixham view on Brexit is not share in all British seaport .A strong pro-European Union sentiment persist , for exampl , in some of Scotland port , which sell lucr catch of salmon , shellfish and lobster to other part of Europ . If Britain leav the union , Scottish fishermen might be hit by larg tariff on those export .Brixham fishermen , on the other hand , have few international-trad incent becaus they sell mainli to the domest market . As they see it , Brexit would mean fewer foreign competitor . Less competit might also help stoke local fishermen incom , which now rang from 30,000 pound to 70,000 pound a year , or about $ 43,000 to $ 99,700 .Brixham econom motiv merg almost seamlessli with cultur tradit on thi side of the English Channel , embrac a histor narr of a Britain perpetu under sieg by the rest of Europ .The wall of a nearbi 15th-centuri fort are still embed with French cannonbal .In 1588 , Sir Franci Drake fought off the Spanish Armada in these water .A centuri later , William of Orang , the Protest Dutch princ , land in Brixham with 14,000 troop to help overthrow King Jame II of England , a Cathol . It wa a rare case in which the local welcom foreign intervent , as commemor by a statu in town that still honor Princ William .Now , for mani in Brixham , the enemi is not a singl invad but the assembl multitud of the European Union .Local particularli resent Brussel for it Common Fisheri Polici , which for decad ha given all European fish fleet equal access to the region water . The polici ha prove disastr becaus it set allowable-catch level too high , accord to Robin Churchil , a professor of intern law at the Univers of Dunde in Scotland , who note that the cod popul collaps in the earli 2000 .Other specialist argu that British water were overfish long befor the fisheri polici took effect in 1983 . And they cite some success at rebuild fish popul sinc 2003 , when the European Union requir fishermen to reduc fleet size and set limit on the number of fish day each year . Scientist say the North Sea cod is now recov strongli and is like to be certifi as sustain next year .That would not have happen without European Union pressur on the British govern , which wa too close to the fish industri , said Howard Wood , chairman of the Commun of Arran Seab Trust . The group aim to protect marin habitat around the Isl of Arran , off western Scotland .If Brexit happen , Mr. Howard said , We just have to hope that we dont go back to our old bad habit of flout rule and overfish .Brian Tolli , a dock master here , is among the Brixhamit who would rather Britain remain in the European Union . If we come out , there could be lot of problem ,  he said . The other countri might gang up on us in term of trade , and wed be wors off.Even the suppos British of Brixham industri is not all that it might seem . Mani of the port fishermen , includ Mr. Sharp , employ Filipino , who help fill out crew becaus too mani local resid shun the work .Fishermen from elsewher in Europ covet British water becaus of their rel larg suppli and divers of fish speci . The British Isl sit on a huge continent shelf that allow sea life to thrive in the shallow water where most fish are caught . The Atlant Ocean off Spain and Portug , by contrast , is poorli stock becaus the seab drop off sharpli .Under the exist European Union regul , British boat have a higher catch quota in the country water than foreign do . But mani fishermen from other part of Europ have taken advantag of European Union law to set up compani in Britain . Thi enabl them to buy British vessel , which are use to fish under Britain quota . A British govern effort to fight thi practic , known as quota hop , wa block in 1992 by the European Court of Justic .More than a third of the fleet oper off England southwest coast are own by foreign , said Jim Portu , a former British fisheri regul who is now chief execut of the South Western Fish Produc , a trade group .Becaus those vessel sell their fish in their own countri , Mr. Portu said , they are fli the British flag but give no econom benefit to the U.K. whatsoever.British fishermen , of cours , are entitl to fish in sea off other European Union countri . But they dont have anyth we want ,  said Ian Perk , a buyer who haggl everi morn in Brixham fish market wear a bowler hat .Richard Barn , a Univers of Hull Law School professor who special in marin environment law , note that if Britain left the European Union , the countri would still need to cooper with individu member of the bloc on manag popul of fish , which cross nation boundari .And if Britain want to maintain a free trade relationship with the bloc , Mr. Barn said , it would still need to give European nation access to British water .Mr. Walker , the Brixham retire , refer to the long-run cod war that end in 1976 onli after Britain agre not to fish within 200 mile of Iceland , which is not a member of the European Union .We use to go and rape the water of Iceland ,  Mr. Walker said . But they kick us in our rear , and quit rightli so ,  he said , clasp hi hand over a gener potbelli . Now they manag their own fish and sell them to us.Mr. Walker said he want Britain to regain the same autonomi .

The term Fitbit Blaze becam one of the most talked-about topic on Facebook and Twitter , but some peopl were compar the devic , unfavor , to the Appl Watch . Mani review of the gadget later made the same Appl comparison . Fitbit stock tumbl more than 12 percent that day .I wa go in think , Thi is go to be awesom ,  Jame Park , Fitbit chief execut , said of the Blaze introduct in an interview last month . I wa definit pretti surpris when I look at some of the aftermath of it.The reaction to the Blaze encapsul the predica face Fitbit , the young compani that ha been a leader in wearabl technolog : In mani people eye , it live in the shadow of Appl , the Silicon Valley behemoth whose touch-screen smartwatch could potenti stomp it smaller rival out of exist .Thi even though Fitbit ha been tri to do everyth right  and ha larg succeed .Fitbit , which went public last year , ha been increas revenu at a rate of more than 90 percent as sale of it fit tracker soar . Last year , Fitbit sold 21.3 million devic , almost doubl the 10.9 million it sold in 2014 . Fitbit , schedul to report earn on Wednesday , is also the world largest maker of wearabl devic by market share , accord to the research firm IDC .Yet the fact that Fitbit product focu on one thing  track your fit  is not help the company imag in thi era of Swiss Armi knife devic , where product like the iPhon and Appl Watch can do multipl thing . Histori ha been unkind to single-purpos gadget , mani of which have flop , like Cisco Flip camcord , or have struggl , like the action camera from GoPro .Compet with Appl , whose cash hoard exce the size of mani countries gross domest product , is also not easi . Although Appl last week report it first sale declin ever in iPhon , Appl Watch sale appear to be grow . Appl doe not break out sale of the watch , but analyst estim it ha sold 12 million of them sinc the product April 2015 debut .As a result , Fitbit stock ha fallen about 10 percent sinc it went public last June . There were concern around competit , particularli from Appl ,  Kati Huberti , an analyst at Morgan Stanley , said of investor skeptic around Fitbit .Mr. Park said it actual doe not bother me at all when peopl frequent compar hi compani to Appl . He said the Appl Watch serv a differ market than Fitbit $ 60 to $ 250 accessori that focu on health monitor .Fitbit purpos took the opposit approach from Appl Watch , he ad . The strategi wa to begin with simpl devic , to make wearabl more approach , and care layer on more featur over time . In contrast , the Appl Watch start out do a bit of everyth : show notif , track fit statist and make phone call .We look at it from a consum point of view ,  Mr. Park said . Appl Watch i a comput platform , but that realli the wrong way to approach thi categori from the veri beginning.An Appl spokeswoman did not respond to request for comment .Indisput , Fitbit is grow , both in staff and sale . At the company San Francisco headquart , a wall in the fifth-floor hallway display a timelin illustr the firm histori . In 2007 , when Mr. Park , a Harvard dropout who had work on photo-shar softwar , found Fitbit with hi busi partner Eric N. Friedman , who is now Fitbit chief of technolog , the start-up had just two employe . By 2015 , it had 1,101 .Insid the offic , furnish in midcenturi modern style , employe are constantli shuffl in and out of confer room for meet . On a recent visit , a group of new hire wa tour the headquart .Still , a concern among investor is whether Fitbit can extract more money from exist custom . Most of it sale are from peopl who buy Fitbit devic for the first time , not those who upgrad .In addit , mani peopl may end up leav their Fitbit devic in a drawer . Of those who bought a Fitbit devic in 2015 , 28 percent stop use it by the end of the year , accord to the compani .That mean that mani peopl who buy Fitbit dont use them for long , and presum arent go to buy anoth Fitbit devic ,  said Jan Dawson , an independ technolog analyst . They have to constantli find new peopl to sell Fitbit to , wherea most consum electron compani can reli on a good amount of repeat business.Address some of these concern fall partli to Woodi Scal , Fitbit chief busi offic , who overse sale and market for the compani . Last year , Fitbit acquir FitStar , which make app offer video instruct on workout . The app charg a monthli subscript fee for access to exercis program , an exampl of how Fitbit could eventu collect money from softwar servic .But it may be a while befor FitStar ha an impact on Fitbit result ; earlier last month , the FitStar app wa rank 157th in the health and fit categori of Apple App Store , accord to App Anni , a research firm . Fitbit said FitStar had accumul 3.5 million download and ha a loyal user base .The big pictur for Fitbit , Mr. Scal said , is it evolut into a digit health monitor platform to discov and prevent health problem . Fitbit ha team up with corpor that offer well program for employe health . BP , for exampl , offer Fitbit to more than 23,000 employe , partli to ensur they are get enough sleep befor they work on oil rig . Mr. Scal said the data from sleep monitor , a featur built in to all Fitbit devic , could lead to new health revel .I believ wev track more night of sleep than have ever been track in the histori of man ,  he said . We can actual now compar it to norm data that we have and we can identifi irregularities.As for Appl , though Mr. Park said he wa not bother by the rival compani , it ha long been in hi sight . When Steve Job introduc the iPhon 4S in 2011 , for exampl , Mr. Park had a realiz .At the time , the new iPhon ad a capabl to synchron with wireless accessori use the standard call Bluetooth . Fitbit tracker back then lack Bluetooth connect , but Mr. Park want them to be abl to synchron data immedi with the iPhon .It could enabl a lot of possibl in term of real-tim feedback ,  he said .So Mr. Park gather a few top employe into a confer room . They decid to re-engin the Fitbit product to support the new featur . The decis set product releas back about six month , but the revis devic becam best seller .Mr. Park said Fitbit wa pois to innov product to stay competit . Sensor are get more sophist , so he imagin a situat where high-end Fitbit devic could eventu support mobil payment or control smart home product like Internet-connect light bulb .Yet the product will stop short of resembl the Appl Watch .Wer go to be veri care with how we includ these thing over time ,  Mr. Park said . I think one of the gener knock against smartwatch is that peopl still dont know what theyr good for , so theyv cram everyth in.', 'Valeant Pharmaceut resolv it default on some of it $ 30 billion in debt by final file on Friday it long-overdu Unit State financi report for 2015 .

Each had record pretax profit for 2015 of $ 10.8 billion , almost entir becaus of sale of truck , S.U.V. , and S.U.V.-lik crossov .Last year , tradit passeng car sale declin slightli in the Unit State , while sale of S.U.V. and crossov lept 16 percent . They account for 35 percent of all vehicl sale last year . The trend ha continu thi year . Through March , S.U.V . and crossov sale surg 9.3 percent from a year ago , while car sale drop nearli 5 percent .Some of thi may be becaus of collaps fuel price , but perhap not all that much . Carmak have narrow the fuel-effici gap between tradit car and S.U.V. , and in ani event , at the high end , the price of ga seem to have minim impact on purchas decis .At G.M. flagship Cadillac brand , sale of it Escalad S.U.V . advanc nearli 25 percent last year , and it SRX crossov jump over 13 percent . The Escalad start at $ 74,000 and a Platinum edit can easili hit six figur . There ha been minim discount , which ha buoy G.M. profit margin . Inde , Cadillac said sale were constrain becaus product couldnt keep up with demand .The Escalad save the Cadillac brand ,  Mr. Fletcher said .In China , now the world largest car market and the ultim battleground for automot brand domin , S.U.V. alreadi account for a third of the market . The Chines are go massiv for these ,  Mr. Fletcher said . The tradit sedan market ha been weak recent , but S.U.V. and crossov are boom for the same reason as they are everywher els : The road are crowd and there are lot of crazi driver on them.In develop countri where the highway infrastructur is still primit , safeti concern are paramount and statu matter , S.U.V . sale are also surg . Last year wealth report from the global real estat consult Knight Frank even target Africa as a potenti growth market : Although wealth in Africa is extrem concentr in certain countri , we see grow potenti for luxuri brand , includ high-end auto marques.The vener Ford Explor and Fiat Chrysler Jeep Cheroke still domin the middl market . Ford and G.M . featur new luxuri S.U.V. or crossov at thi year auto show , with more model on the way .Ford Lincoln brand ha been draw big crowd to it new Navig S.U.V . concept vehicl , which , like the Tesla , featur gullw door . It redesign front grill look a lot like the Jaguar and Bentley .The exot door will not surviv when the product model goe on sale next year , but the luxuri interior probabl will . It look a littl like a first-class airlin cabin , featur video screen at everi seat and an intercom connect the first and third row of seat .Cadillac unveil it new XT5 crossov , which replac the popular SRX , and ha said it ha more S.U.V. in the develop pipelin . Still , both American maker are far behind BMW , which offer at least seven model of S.U.V. and what it call S.A.V. , for Sport Activ Vehicl .Not that today S.U.V . ha much to do with sport , util or ani activ like to work up much of a sweat . If youv got two kid and all their equip and still want comfort and luxuri , these model are appeal ,  Mr. Fletcher said . Theyr not a station wagon or minivan . There a cool factor . You sit up high , youv got a good view of the road , and you feel safe . Onc peopl experi thi , it hard to go back.Automot purist and drive enthusiast may sniff at the bulki profil and trucklik handl of the tradit model ( Ferrari insist it wont make an S.U.V . ) , but automak are follow demand and look for growth by appeal to the world most affluent consum . And some of the new model , like the Maserati , manag to disguis their bulk with sleek curv and distinct style .Mani of these factor were in evid at thi spring New York auto show . Mike Fedorenko of Westfield , N.J. , told me he wa trade up from a Ford Explor to one of the new luxuri S.U.V. after recent inherit some money . He admir the red and black leather seat in the Jaguar F-Pace and the reason price ( start at $ 42,000 ) but otherwis dismiss the interior appoint as cheesy. ( It probabl didnt help the Jaguar that the Bentley burl walnut and quilt leather wa in our peripher vision . ) He said he wa lean toward the new Maserati Levant or a Porsch Cayenn .Mr. Fedorenko said fuel effici wasnt a concern . Im sure the world would be a better place if we all drove Mini ,  he said . But with so mani crazi driver on the road , I want the biggest vehicl I can get.', 'Bank regul on Wednesday sent a messag that big bank are still too big and too complex . They reject special plan , call live will , that the bank have to submit to show they can go through an orderli bankruptci .The think behind the regulators call for live will is that if a larg bank crash is orderli , there will be no need to save it and no need for taxpay bailout .Pretti straightforward , right ? Not for the bank . The regul deliber did not commun the exact thing the bank need to do for their plan to pass muster . In thi way , they kept them on their toe  and treat power bank thi way may end up play a surprisingli import role in keep the financi regul effect over time .Over the decad lead up to the financi crisi of 2008 , bank learn how to sidestep and water down the rel tough regul introduc after the crash of 1929 . Thi abil of the bank to get their way wa spot by Hyman Minski , a maverick economist who die 20 year ago . He wa prophet , too . He identifi and warn about the sort of trend in the financi system and the wider economi that help caus the last financi crisi . That is whi when everyth start fall apart in 2008 , some comment said a Minski moment had arriv .Mr. Minski pithili observ that stabil give rise to instabl . As the economi grow steadili , bank and compani start to overreach . Bank lend too much , and compani and consum overborrow , which ultim make the system fragil . And while financi regul wa necessari to limit excess behavior dure those stabl time , Mr. Minski observ that banker eventu found way around the rule .Thi part of Mr. Minsky think wa on my mind thi week at the annual Minski confer at the Levi Econom Institut of Bard Colleg . The focu of the gather wa the Dodd-Frank Act , the sweep overhaul of the financi system that Congress pass in 2010 . Mani of the speaker , be acolyt of Mr. Minski , said they expect the banker to find way to dodg Dodd-Frank in the come year .But Dodd-Frank might have built-in self-protect . It seem to take into account Mr. Minsky warn , with provis that allow the law to be refresh and chang as the financi system evolv . Regul have alreadi use those featur to seiz the initi over banker .They have done so with so-cal live will . The regul get to determin what need to be in the live will . One senior agenc offici told me on Wednesday that they tri not to make the exercis so clear that the bank treat it just like ani other complianc exercis .Perhap even more import are the annual regulatori stress test that assess how larg bank would bear up under theoret crash in the market and global economi . Undertaken by the Feder Reserv , these test have caus signific headach for the bank , and some bank have fail them , mostli becaus their plan for handl the hypothet stress were judg inadequ . Thi ha caus uneas among the banks senior manag . If the bank flunk the stress test , they dont get to distribut money to sharehold or buy back share . The bank are kept on their toe becaus condit assum in the test , and the thing regul look for , can chang .Dodd-Frank also set up someth call the Financi Stabil Oversight Council , a special regulatori bodi that sit abov other regul . One of it main job is to scour the financi system look for new risk . If it can resist the influenc of bank lawyer and lobbyist , the council could use thi power to limit the growth of new financi product that are devis to avoid regul .The council also seek to identifi which larg financi firm that are not bank  think , big insur compani  should be subject to stricter regul . It a duti that wa devis in respons to the huge buildup of risk at the American Intern Group , which receiv one of the biggest bailout .True , the financi industri ha alreadi won a substanti victori to limit regul . A Feder District Court recent rule that the council could not subject MetLif , a larg insur compani , to stricter regul . Still , mani lawyer believ that the court rule is shaki and will be overturn on appeal .Mr. Minski would be wari , howev . These featur of Dodd-Frank that allow regul to stay ahead of the bank requir independent-mind regul to use them . The economi is strengthen , and bank are get healthier . Thi is the period of stabil that Mr. Minski warn about , when the regul start to believ that most risk have been constrain , caus them to miss new danger . And the financi industri is like to win import victori in Congress that roll back regul , as it did at the end of 2014 , when an import part of Dodd-Frank wa gut .But for now at least , bank regul seem will to use their freedom to mess with the bank .', 'LONDON  In a symbol slap against high execut pay at a money-los compani , BP sharehold have vote against the $ 19.6 million compens packag for the chief execut , Robert W.

The polici will be submit to sharehold at the annual meet next year , in a vote that will be bind , said the spokesman , David Nichola .Investor have chafe at Mr. Dudley receiv a 20 percent increas in overal compens , despit a $ 6.5 billion loss report by the compani for 2015 , as sharpli lower oil price exact a sever toll on profit .Accord to BP , the talli of proxi vote cast befor Thursday annual gener meet in London wa 59.1 percent against and 40.9 percent in favor .There are still addit vote to be count , but they are unlik to significantli alter the proport , Mr. Nichola said .As is legal requir at British compani , the BP chief executive pay is determin by a formula that is put to a vote by sharehold everi three year . BP current formula wa approv by about 96 percent of sharehold in 2014 , Mr. Nichola said .At Thursday meet , Carl-Henr Svanberg , BP chairman , told sharehold that the board wa awar of their concern .Let me be clear : We hear you ,  Mr. Svanberg said , accord to a transcript provid by BP . We will sit down with our largest sharehold to make sure we understand their concern ,  he said .Mr. Svanberg also said that the board had alway judg execut perform not on the price of oil or bottom-lin profit but on measur that are clearli within management control.

Instead , it is intend to challeng the legal process regard secreci order .The compani is also tri to fuel a public debat about the frequent use of secreci order in govern investig and , in the process , portray itself as an advoc of it customers privaci . The suit itself could plod through the court , with appeal go on for month or even year .Emili Pierc , a spokeswoman for the Justic Depart , said offici were review the filing.Microsoft is draw attent to legal issu that have becom more acut as tech compani move their customers person and busi inform into so-cal cloud comput system . The largest such digit storehous of person email and document are oper by big tech compani like Microsoft , Googl and Appl .Seiz inform from file drawer or person comput use to requir enter a build to examin paper or a hard drive . Typic , the target of an investig knew about it .Not so in the cloud comput era , when investig can bypass an individu and go straight to the compani that host that inform . And when court issu secreci order , often with no time limit , a target may never know that inform wa taken .Microsoft , in it suit , contend that the govern ha exploit the transit to cloud comput as a mean of expand it power to conduct secret investigations.In an interview , Bradford L. Smith , Microsoft presid and chief legal offic , said , Peopl should not lose their right just becaus they are store their inform in the cloud.Microsoft , like Googl and Appl , field thousand of request a year from feder and state prosecutor for custom inform . The compani issu period report with the total .But , Mr. Smith said , it wa the rise portion of gag order attach to the inform warrant that led to the suit . From Septemb 2014 to March 2016 , Microsoft receiv 5,624 feder demand in the Unit State for custom inform or data . Nearli half  2,576  were accompani by secreci order .Mr. Smith call the grow share of secreci order fairli shock ,  suggest they had becom a routin process rather than an except .The suit posit Microsoft as a champion of it customers privaci and draw attent to a legal process mani may not be awar of .Most peopl do think of their email as their person properti , wherev it happen to resid ,  said A. Michael Froomkin , a law professor at the Univers of Miami . But there is a disconnect between behavior and expect and the statut . And Microsoft is invit a court to bring the law in line with people expectations.Beyond image-burnish , the suit is a pragmat attempt to move away from litig case one by one , which is costli and time-consum .Microsoft is go on offens , but theyr kind of forc into it ,  Mr. Froomkin said .Judg grant the secreci order . Microsoft see onli the warrant for the inform demand and not the argument made by the prosecutor to justifi a gag order . But the Microsoft legal team look at the high percentag of secreci order grant in the year and a half through March of thi year , and conclud that prosecutor often reli on a vagu standard that there wa a reason to believe that disclosur might hinder an investig .Microsoft , Mr. Smith said , readili recogn that nondisclosur order are appropri and necessary when there is a risk of endang a person life or that crucial evid may be destroy , for exampl . What concern us is the low standard the govern ha to bear and the absenc of a time limit ,  Mr. Smith ad .About two-third of the secreci order Microsoft receiv in the span it audit had no time limit . In the physic world , so-cal sneak-and-peek warrant for secret search are grant to look at document without notifi a target . But most secreci order delay notif for a fix period of time , typic 30 to 90 day , and detail evid is requir for ani extens .Microsoft , Mr. Smith said , ha talk to other major tech compani , and other may join with brief in support of Microsoft .In addit to challeng the Justic Depart and the court , Microsoft is tri to prod Congress into look at the issu . In both the Hous of Repres and the Senat , legisl ha been propos to reform the Electron Commun Privaci Act .

The compani get it result by crunch data on million of onlin transact it track through it onlin market servic .The price of televis onlin fell a cumul 20.3 percent from Februari 2015 to Februari 2016 , accord to the latest number from Adobe Digit Price Index , releas on Thursday . The Bureau of Labor Statistics Consum Price Index , by contrast , log a 15 percent drop in TV price over the same time period .The same held true for the price of household applianc like refriger and dishwash . Onlin , applianc price drop 5.7 percent in the year to Februari , compar with a 2.7 percent declin in the government price index equival .Furnitur and bed price show less of a fall onlin and in physic store , but the spread between the two wa still wide : a 2.5 percent declin , accord to Adob , compar with a 0.5 declin in the Consum Price Index .The new price index from Adob is meant to be a complement to the price index releas by the Labor Depart , which track fewer good onlin , offer economist new data point . The number releas on Thursday were the second monthli number from the compani .The lower price suggest by the digit index are good news if your in the market for a new televis or refriger . The index also ha implic for our understand of the wider economi .Austan Goolsbe , a former chairman of Presid Obama Council of Econom Advis , who ha been help Adob develop it index , said the Adob figur suggest that the government index could be underestim deflat , or the overal fall in price , in the economi .Larg part of the economi , a fast-grow part , is now e-commerce-ori ,  Mr. Goolsbe said . And Amazon price are much cheaper , and if everybody do their shop on Amazon , then that should properli be taken into account in the inflat rate in a way it isnt now.He said it could help explain whi inflat remain low , for exampl , despit a boom job market .Research at the Bureau of Labor Statist period conduct survey with shopper to figur out what product they buy and where , and base on those survey , build a basket of good . Then each month , inspector go out to store to check the price of those good  about 94,000 individu item .To tri to keep the basket of good current , the bureau updat about an eighth of the basket everi six month . If consum report buy item onlin , those item have a chanc of be pick for the basket .But the bureau own economist are the first to acknowledg there are sever drawback to the process . Becaus these survey take time , the composit of the basket of good probabl reflect consum behavior from a few year ago , said Steve Reed , an economist with the bureau consum price program .So the index could lag in reflect the shift in shop to the web  and the lower price that follow .It alway been the case that wev trail actual consum behavior ,  Mr. Reed said .In comparison , the Adob index track about 1.7 million consum good , all onlin , in real time . It can incorpor new good quickli , and pick up price trend over day , not just month . For exampl , data from Black Friday last year show that TV price realli did fall over all dure that holiday weekend . So Black Friday may realli be the best time to buy a new TV .Some Internet deal , of cours , can be decept . Still , the lower price make sens , said Tamara Gaffney , the princip research analyst on Adobe digit index project , becaus websit let shopper brows and shop anywher , compar price across multipl seller and take advantag of the best bargain avail .And not all onlin price were lower . Groceri bought onlin log a cumul inflat of 0.75 percent in the 12 month to Februari . Over the same period , the Consum Price Index for that categori fell 0.31 percent .That could be becaus shopper who do their groceri shop onlin tend to skew richer , Ms. Gaffney said , and are less like to shop around on differ site to find the best price . Shopper may also be less like to invest effort into find a good deal for a carton of milk onlin as oppos to , say , a tablet .Over all , though , brick-and-mortar store are face pressur to match the low price of their onlin rival . Shopper regularli use smartphon to compar price right in the store aisl .The import of onlin price will continu to grow as shop shift onlin , Ms. Gaffney . Sinc the Adob index wa introduc last month , Adob ha begun track applianc , toy and furnitur , and will continu to add more categori , she said .A lot of thing youd think arent onlin are start to move onlin , like restaur order . So it alway possibl that someth you think of as pure offlin could becom more trackabl via digit big data ,  she said .Still , the govern index track product we dont buy onlin and most like wont for a long time , like ga or hospit servic . That make the index a good measur of price in the wider economi .Peopl will alway pay attent to the C.P.I . as a measur of inflat ,  Mr. Goolsbe said . But Id think everybodi who care about the cost of live  like the Fed make monetari decis , the govern make forecast and peopl evalu how incom have chang in real term  have to at least wonder in their mind whether theyr measur thing correctly.', 'When the car industri collaps in the recess , automak pull back sharpli on aggress leas deal and other financi incent that had artifici increas their sale for year .But now , with carmak under pressur to maintain last year record number , they are onc again turn to the same tactic that got them into troubl a decad ago .Automak are offer increas discount on economi car and luxuri model alik , reli more on sale to fleet like rental-car compani and bloat dealers inventori . More and more auto loan are be stretch out over longer period of time .At the same time , automak have crank up leas to record level . In March , leas account for 31.3 percent of all new-car transact , a record that exce the prerecess level , accord to Edmunds.com , an auto research websit .But there could be a harsh payback in the futur . Automak that reli heavili on leas end up take the vehicl back in three or four year and sell them as use  often at big discount .Iv seen thi movi befor ; it not a pretti end ,  said Mike Jackson , chief execut of AutoN , a chain of 373 new-car franchis . In the mid-2000 , he rail against similar excess that overh the auto market , and he fret again .Manufactur incent are at a danger level ,  Mr. Jackson said . Pump up sale through profit- incent and high fleet sale , he ad , i nitroglycerin.At the top of Mr. Jackson concern is leas , which is a way of rent a new car for a specifi period of time , like 24 or 36 month . Custom like leas becaus they typic make lower monthli payment than if they bought car with loan . Automak and dealer like leas becaus they get more flexibl to structur deal that enabl custom to get pricier car with afford payment .Consid the leas secur by Allen Lin , a teacher from Altadena , Calif .A few week ago , he walk into a Lexu dealership and drove out about two hour later with a 2016 RX 350 , leas for three year at $ 408 a month . The small sport util vehicl  one of the most popular on the market  had recent been fulli overhaul , and redesign car model typic sell with littl or no discount . But Mr. Lin paid no money up front , did not trade in hi old car and got $ 5,000 knock off the car list price of $ 43,779 .If you can get a deal like thi , it pretti sweet ,  said Mr. Lin , 35 .Brian Smith , vice presid for market at Lexu , said that leas help keep custom from stray to other brand but that Lexu did not use it to drive sale volum .Luxuri maker tend to lean on leas more heavili than more middle-of-the-market brand . For exampl , more than half of all Lexu , BMW , Mercedes-Benz , Audi and Acura car are leas . Still , all automak use leas to some extent , and all shape and size can be leas .The three most-leas vehicl are the Honda Civic , the Honda Accord and the Toyota Camri , accord to Experian Automot .A Honda spokesman said the Japanes automak took a measur approach to leas to maintain used-car valu . Toyota said it also manag leas with a focu on residu valu .In the past few year , some brand have significantli increas leas . Five year ago , leas made up less than 20 percent of sale for Chevrolet , Hyundai and Mazda . Now it account for more than 30 percent of their sale .A spokesman for Gener Motor said leas help Chevrolet increas sale and retain custom . Hyundai leas level are in line with industri practic , a spokesman said . Mazda limit leas discount to maxim the valu of use car for custom , a compani spokesman said .But while leas can lift sale , they also pose risk for car compani and their financ arm . They have to borrow billion of dollar to financ leas , and then , after leas expir , they take the car back and sell them through dealership or at used-car auction . Sell gentli use car can be a good busi for dealer and can help automak attract new custom .But if they leas too mani vehicl , or econom condit sour , the valu of use car can fall and leav car compani with big loss .That exactli what happen in 2008 , when the market suddenli crash and automak and dealer were left a glut of car come off leas .Some analyst worri that the industri could be head for that kind of situat .Dealer now have 3.8 million new car in inventori , the most in 10 year , accord to WardsAuto . On top of that , Experian report that 1.8 million car , moder use dure leas , are expect to enter the use car market thi year , provid lower-cost altern to new car .Thi is happen at a time when consum purchas of new car are slow .In the first quarter of the year , sale to individu consum rose less than 1 percent , compar with the same period a year ago , accord to data from J.D . Power and Associ . In March , consum new-car purchas , known as retail sale , fell 1 percent . But total sale are higher becaus of a big jump in sale to fleet , such as rental compani .Car compani are also offer auto loan over longer period of time . Edmunds.com found that more than 27 percent of all new car sold in the first quarter went to custom who took out loan last 73 to 84 month , up from 23.4 percent in the same period a year ago .It feel like a tougher market now ,  said Mark Wakefield , a manag partner at AlixPartn , a consult firm with a larg automot practic . It difficult to see where the growth is go to come from.Alix is predict leaner time ahead . It see vehicl sale rise about 2 percent thi year to 17.8 million car and light truck , and then declin , slip steadili to 16.2 million vehicl in 2019 .That leav mani automak push leas deal to drive sale . Thi month , for exampl , BMW is offer a deal on it i3 electr car . It is avail in mani part of the countri for just $ 163 a month for 24 month , with no down payment . The deal is base on a price of $ 31,999  a 32 percent discount from the car list price .BMW leas busi ensur dealer have a steadi stream of well-maintain , use model to offer value-mind custom , a compani spokesman said . Such certifi pre-owned car also keep use BMW price firm , he said .Derrick Oxend , a commerci properti owner in Ann Arbor , Mich. , still had a few month to go on the three-year leas for hi 2013 Ford F-350 diesel truck . He wa pay $ 825 a month base on it list price of about $ 58,000 .But a salesman from hi Ford dealer call and said he could turn in hi 2013 truck and leas a 2016 model , load with extra like heat rear seat . Although hi new F-350 is price at $ 71,000 , he got a new leas with a monthli payment of just $ 695 .You have to be stupid not to do it ,  Mr. Oxend said .', 'Nissan is recal about 3.5 million vehicl , includ almost 3.2 million in the Unit State , becaus the front-passeng airbag might not work properli in a crash , accord to report from the automak post Friday on the websit of the Nation Highway Traffic Safeti Administr .The action end a two-year effort by feder regul to get the automak to fix widespread problem with the occup sens system , which is suppos to detect whether the passeng seat is empti or occupi by a child or adult .

For month , agent had been intercept phone call and email belong to member of an anim welfar group that wa believ to be sabotag oper of a compani that wa use anim to test drug . But encrypt softwar had made the email unread .So investig tri someth new . They persuad a judg to let them remot , and secretli , instal softwar on the group comput to help get around the encrypt .That effort , reveal in newli declassifi and releas record , show in new detail how F.B.I . hacker work to defeat encrypt more than a decad befor the agency recent fight with Appl over access to a lock iPhon . The Trail Mix case wa , in some way , a precursor to the Appl disput . In both case , the agent could not decod the data themselv , but found a clever workaround .The Trail Mix record also reveal what is believ to be the first exampl of the F.B.I . remot instal surveil softwar , known as spywar or malwar , as part of a crimin wiretap .Thi wa the first time that the Depart of Justic had ever approv such an intercept of thi type ,  an F.B.I . agent wrote in a 2005 document sum up the case .The next year , six activist were convict of conspiraci to violat the Anim Enterpris Protect Act in the case . An appeal court upheld the convict in 2009 , and said that the use of encrypt , among other thing , wa circumstanti evid of their agreement to particip in illeg activity.Ryan Shapiro , a nation secur research and anim welfar advoc , provid the document in the case to The New York Time after obtain them in a Freedom of Inform Act lawsuit . Sever import detail remain secret , includ whether the tactic work . The wiretap wa disclos at trial but the softwar hack wa not , said Lauren Gazzola , one of the defend , who now work for the Center for Constitut Right .It is also unclear whi the Justic Depart , which is requir to report everi time it come across encrypt in a crimin wiretap case , did not do so in 2002 or 2003 . The Justic Depart and F.B.I . did not comment Wednesday .The Trail Mix document provid an unusu , if date , glimps at the cat-and-mous game that the F.B.I . ha been play for year with peopl who use technolog to keep their affair secret . The record show that , even when encrypt wa not wide use , there wa a grow frustrat about it in the F.B.I . To defeat it , agent built and use surveil softwar earlier than wa known .The document show that the F.B.I . ha been in the hack busi for a long time ,  said Chri Soghoian , a technolog analyst with the American Civil Liberti Union who review the record .In 2008 the F.B.I . began a campaign call Go Dark to build support for law requir compani to allow govern access to data in unencrypt form . But the Trail Mix record show that agent were frustrat by encrypt mani year earlier , and saw the fight against terror as an opportun to get new author .The current terror prevent context may present the best opportun to bring up the encrypt issu ,  an F.B.I . offici said in a Decemb 2002 email . A month later , a draft bill , call Patriot Act 2 , reveal that the Justic Depart wa consid outlaw the use of encrypt to conceal crimin activ . The bill did not pass .The Trail Mix investig focus on sabotag and stalk at Huntingdon Life Scienc , a compani with a New Jersey laboratori that conduct pharmaceut test on anim . The group Stop Huntingdon Anim Cruelti strongli oppos the company test and advoc protest to end it .F.B.I . agent contend member of the group were also behind crimin attack that includ nuisanc like send nonstop fax of all-black paper and hack attack that caus more than $ 450,000 in damag and lost busi . Feder law label such attack eco-terror .The activist commun use a well-known secur program call Pretti Good Privaci , which make email unread by anyon without a password and a digit key . The agent tri sever tactic , includ get a full-content wiretap that intercept everi byte that left the group comput . Yet the encrypt prove unbreak .More than a decad later , the F.B.I . still can not break sophist encrypt such as the kind use on Apple iPhon . Earli thi year , in it investig of the San Bernardino , Calif. , terrorist attack , the Justic Depart tri to requir Appl to remov some secur featur from a lock iPhon so the F.B.I . could guess the password . Eventu , a privat consult develop a way to hack into the phone without Apple help , and sold the idea to the F.B.I .Agent in the Trail Mix case also found a workaround . Like the San Bernardino case , the Trail Mix solut were classifi .Pleas be advis that the tool itself is classifi SECRET ,  an F.B.I . comput specialist from Quantico , Va. , wrote in earli 2003 while deliv an earli version of the tool . Further , ani indic that the tool is specif softwar in natur is also classified.Exactli what the softwar wa built to do is still not clear . But languag in the document suggest that it may have copi the digit key , kept track of keystrok to help the F.B.I . identifi the password , or both .In a Mafia case year earlier , agent sneak into a Philadelphia offic and attach a devic to a comput that record everi keystrok . That classifi devic help agent break into an encrypt file . But until Trail Mix , such a tactic had never been tri use softwar as part of a wiretap , the document show .Case like Oper Trail Mix and the San Bernardino shoot are exampl of whi mani govern offici say they need a new law to guarante access to encrypt data .

All but one of the death have been in the Unit State , includ a 17-year-old who wa kill last week when the Takata airbag in her Honda Civic ruptur in a crash .Fourteen automak have recal about 28 million inflat in 24 million car to fix Takata faulti airbag , in the largest and one of the most complic recal in automot histori . On Wednesday , the Nation Highway Traffic Safeti Administr said that about 85 million more similar airbag inflat might need to be recal if Takata can not prove they are safe . That would bring the total recal talli to 113 million inflat , the replac cost of which could add up to billion of dollar .The intern commun , unseal as part of a lawsuit against Takata , also shed new light on how much top execut in Tokyo knew and direct the company respons to the mount death and injuri .

Takata is respons for 100 percent of the cost ,  the email say .In the same email is a discuss of 62,000 airbag that are under review becaus the propel wa manufactur dure a similar time period . But Takata and Honda limit their recal to a subset of just 4,200 car .Just a month after Mr. Bernat sent that email , a teenag from Oklahoma , Ashley Parham , wa kill when the airbag in her 2001 Honda Accord explod out of her steer wheel in a minor crash .

The company fall from grace came to symbol the overreach of Silicon Valley and the hype that surround unproven technolog .While Ms. Holm ha continu to defend the compani in as mani forum as she can , the lack of hard inform about whether the technolog work ha onli increas the skeptic surround her compani .Examin from Medicar inspect Theranos laboratori in Newark , Calif. , last fall and found numer defici , one of which they said pose immedi jeopardi to patient health and safety.That particular defici relat to Theranos test for the clot abil of blood , a measur use to help determin the correct dose of the blood-thin drug warfarin . Too much warfarin can caus intern bleed while too littl can leav a patient vulner to a stroke . The inspect report , which wa recent made public by Medicar , said that all 81 result provid to patient from that test from April to Septemb of last year were inaccur .Therano said in respons to regul that it had void the result of those test . Ms. Buchanan said the compani , after talk to the patient and doctor involv , did not believ ani patient had been harm .The regul also said that the director of the laboratori wa not qualifi and some other personnel were inadequ train . At the time of the inspect , the laboratori director wa a local dermatologist who continu to run hi medic practic while also supervis the lab .After receiv the regulators find in Januari , Therano submit a plan to correct the problem in Februari . But in propos the sanction , the new letter from the regul say that the company respons doe not constitut a credibl alleg of complianc and accept evid of correct for the defici cited.Among other thing the letter said some document refer to in Theranos submiss were miss . It also said the compani had not provid enough inform to justifi it conclus regard whether patient were affect .Philip D.

You can use the sheet to note inform about charact , plot point , scene set and other detail . Thi part of the app is surprisingli power , and I have found that the preformat section of the stori sheet ( for exampl , the Smell head under the Set stori sheet ) help me think about charact and scene set .Storyist work well with or without a keyboard . It also save document seamlessli to the cloud so you can begin your work on your tablet and edit it on your phone . But it interfac is a bit complex and take some get use to . The app cost $ 15 and work onli on iO devic .For a write app with a simpler interfac than Storyist , check out iA Writer , which ha littl on-screen clutter like button and control . The app borrow the look and feel of it write interfac from a tradit typewrit , includ the font you type in .The app cleverest featur is it focu mode ,  which fade out everyth els in your document other than the line or paragraph your work on . Thi work similarli to how your eye stay focus on the word you have just type on the paper when use a tradit typewrit . Anoth clever option with iA Writer is that you can highlight adject , noun , verb and the like in differ color , which may prevent overdecor of text .To preview the final result , there is a visual neat mode that show what the document would look like if print in a tradit book format .

The Zen feel is nurtur visual : The page you write on is decor with delic imag of object like tree . The app also encourag peopl to wear headphon while write and play a select of gentl background music and natur sound .I found that OmmWriter simplic help focu my mind  but the app is not a real word processor , so those who want to do more complex edit may want to copi their text to anoth app . OmmWriter on-screen keyboard also take a lot of get use to , and I found myself make mani more typo than I did when use Apple built-in keyboard . OmmWrit for the iPad is $ 5 .Anoth app , Scrivo Pro , ha a similar complex to Storyist . It most power featur is that it can work with file export from Scriven , a veri popular creative-writ app that run on tradit comput . Scrivo Pro is capabl and power , but it ha a steep learn curv .

But interest paid on the lowest-risk feder insur account remain lacklust .Consum will to jump through some hoop , howev , can get much better return on their save .In it annual review of high-yield check account , the financi websit Bankrat found that the averag yield at bank and credit union wa 1.65 percent , while nearli a dozen yield 2 percent or more . By contrast , the averag money market account yield just 0.11 percent .Bankrate analysi look at a sampl of 56 bank and credit union in mid- to late Februari .But onli about half of the high-yield account are avail to consum nation , and all come with lot of string attach . Most , for instanc , requir direct deposit and at least 10 debit transact a month to earn the highest rate . Other requir may includ agre to receiv monthli statement electron and pay bill onlin . And a few bank say they offer the account nation but still requir an in-person visit to a branch to open the account .Thi is not someth that go to work for everybodi ,  said Greg McBride , Bankrate chief financi analyst .For consum who have direct deposit and use debit card a lot , howev , open one of the account could be worthwhil sinc interest rate on save account and certif of deposit remain pedestrian . All the more reason to be proactiv ,  he said ,  to make sure your get the best return on your money.One exampl of a nation avail account is offer by Main Street Bank in Bingham Farm , Mich . The account offer 2.25 percent on balanc up to $ 25,000 ( the rate on balanc over the cap is 0.25 percent ) . In addit to a direct deposit or one automat payment , the requir includ 12 debit transact a month .Ken Tumin , founder of DepositAccounts.com , a websit that track deposit rate , said mani of hi reader are older peopl look to maxim return on low-risk account , and some have multipl high-yield check account . ( He call them high-yield reward check account becaus they typic offer a reward like reimburs of A.T.M . fee in addit to the higher rate . )One reader , he said , ha at least 10 of these account . While manag them and make sure all the variou requir are met is a challeng for consum , he said , Theyr seriou in term of maxim their save in a safe way.To get the most from the account , it best to think of them as a save account , rather than a check account , Mr. McBride said . The requir debit should probabl be for smaller amount , he said , so the higher rate is appli to the largest balanc possibl . ( A few bank requir that the debit transact hit a minimum purchas level , so be sure to check the detail . )Here are some question and answer about high-yield check account : What if I dont make the requir number of debit transact ?You wont get the highest rate on your deposit for that month but will instead get a much lower , default interest rate . The averag default rate is 0.06 percent . The default rate isnt perman , howev ; you can regain it by meet the requir debit the next month . And , Mr. Tumin said , the high-yield account typic have no monthli fee , so while you wont earn the higher rate if you fail to meet the account criteria , you wont be penal with an addit charg . Is there a limit on the balanc that earn the higher rate ?Usual , ye  and that can limit the money you earn on your fund . Consum must weigh the rate along with the balanc cap to determin which account would gener the most interest for them , Mr. McBride said .The cap rang from a low of $ 500 to a high of $ 25,000 , with an averag of about $ 16,000 , Bankrat found . Earn 2 percent on the averag would earn more than $ 300 for the account holder .But of the 15 highest-yield account , just one had a balanc cap higher than $ 15,000 .Northpoint Bank in Grand Rapid , Mich. , for instanc , offer a yield of 5 percent , but it cap the balanc elig for the rate at $ 5,000 . Fund over the limit earn just 0.1 percent .Mr. Tumin suggest that consum with a rel small amount of money to deposit choos the account with the highest rate , while those with a larger pot select an account with the highest cap . What if I alreadi have my paycheck deposit into anoth account ?Some employ allow you to have your direct paycheck deposit split among multipl account , Mr. McBride said . So you could have a portion deposit into a main check account , which you use to pay monthli bill , and have the rest deposit into the high-yield account to meet the criteria for the higher interest rate .In addit , some account allow deposit that use an autom clear hous electron network for clear financi transact  so-cal A.C.H . transact  to meet the direct-deposit criteria , Mr. Tumin said . So you could set up a recur automat transfer from an onlin save account  say , one offer by the Alli Bank or Capit One 360  to meet that requir .', 'WASHINGTON  Retail sale in the Unit State unexpectedli fell in March as household cut back on purchas of automobil and other item .

Over the year , her gift have includ an old Sport Illustr with a hologram of Michael Jordan on the cover and a photographi tour of a particularli photogen part of southern China .So for my most recent birthday , I had no idea what to expect when she hand me a larg box . Insid , I found a new drone .The onli problem : I had to learn how to fli it .Thi may not be easi for mani peopl . First , there is the matter of figur out the capabl of the drone . Consum drone come in differ size and price . You can build your own drone , attach a GoPro camera and custom a rang of option . Or you can get one that work right out of the box .Fli the drone is daunt . There are regul to know . In the Unit State , becaus the industri is rel new , feder rule are sometim at odd with regul set by state and local author .In Britain , where I live , rule for fli hobbyist drone are merci more straightforward , and the Civil Aviat Author ha taken step to translat often dens guidanc into easier-to-understand languag . In Juli , it releas The Dronecode and ha publish an anim video summar the rule .There is also the safeti of other to consid . British aviat author record 39 airprox incid , or aerial near-miss , in 2015 , and those are just one that involv a drone and anoth aircraft . I did not want to make headlin .But there are way to eas into it . Commerci drone oper and those take profession video can take short cours to ensur they know what they are do . For novic like myself , YouTub video abound , offer tip and explain .Not everybodi who can control thing on the ground ha 3-D spatial awar ,  said Jonathan Carter , a director of the Aerial Academi , which conduct cours to help profession drone user get licens by the Civil Aviat Author . Mr. Carter , who first strap a compact camera to a single-rotor drone in 2010 out of curios , said the cours could be complet in as littl as a week and cost about $ 1,600 .For me , the first step wa evalu my drone , a DJI Phantom 3 . DJI , which is base in Shenzhen in southern China , make more small-scal drone than ani other manufactur , and the Phantom seri ha been the world best-sel consum drone . The compani wa found in 2006 and ha been valu at around $ 8 billion .My Phantom 3 Standard cost about $ 635 . Weigh less than three pound , it is a white plastic quadcopt with an attach camera that shoot video at 2.7K and captur 12 megapixel photo . I could fit the entir system  the drone , detach propel and the remot control  in my backpack .The instruct for fli the drone were straightforward . Simpli download DJI mobil phone app , attach the propel to the machin , turn the drone and remot control on and the app guid you through the setup process .For beginn , DJI app offer a basic mode that restrict the drone to an altitud and distanc of 100 feet . All you need to do to initi takeoff is tap an on-screen button on your smartphon and then swipe to confirm . After that , you are airborn .Everyth is control with the mobil app in tandem with the remot control , and you can have as much , or as littl , assist as you want . Land can be complet manual or automat . While in the air , you can control the drone yourself or use one of a hand of intellig modes that let you instruct it to circl a singl point , follow you without chang distanc or altitud or trace a predetermin set of direct . If your batteri is about to run out , it immedi come back to it takeoff point .So far , so good . The next task wa assess the rule of fli in my area . Where I live , there are a few geograph restrict  basic stay away from the airport , Parliament and royal park like Kensington Garden .Over the come year , though , those regul may be in flux , accord to Peter Lee , a consult at the law firm Taylor Vinter .I think the catalyst would be some kind of catastroph event that would realli forc the public narr down the track of stricter regul ,  said Mr. Lee , who own two hobbyist drone .After learn what the local regul were , my wife and I chose Battersea Park in the southwestern part of the citi for a first flight . There , we found a rel quiet area . Though the market for civilian drone is appar grow fast  the chief execut of 3D Robot , a DJI competitor , said in Octob 2014 that it wa worth $ 1 billion and forecast almost uniformli predict rapid expans  I wa the onli person at the park with one .Follow the instruct , I turn everyth on , and with minim effort the drone rose abov me . Peopl nearbi slow to watch , and my wife snap a coupl of pictur on her iPhon . Boy with their toy ,  she said later .It wa all remark easi , albeit brief ( more on that later ) . The drone wa comfort to maneuv , the app wa easi to use , and the video that the drone wa record wa sharp . Everyth wa save on a microSD card , mean it can be pop into mani laptop or some TV and view , edit and share without much troubl . I have kept my video on a laptop but am cut togeth a coupl of video to put on YouTub eventu .Crucial , it wa fun . See your surround from a differ angl is interest and add a cool element to the experi . I have live here for sever year , on and off , but I now want to re-explor place I have alreadi been to just to use the Phantom and see them from abov .The drone is not without it limit . The batteri life is frustratingli short . In all , I got about 20 minut of HD video captur on a full charg , a number that is in line with DJI advertis batteri capac . At variou point , the camera real-tim display also would disconnect , and on anoth clear day in the park , the app told me I did not have a strong enough GP connect to use some of the intellig mode .DJI said thi wa most like becaus of the Phantom 3 Standard relianc on Wi-Fi , rather than Lightbridg , the company wireless commun technolog , which ha a longer rang . The technolog is use in DJI newer and more advanc model .Windi day also made fli a littl tougher , though by no mean veri difficult . Be in an urban set , I tri to fli the quadcopt high enough to make sure peopl in the area did not feel as though I wa spi on them , restrict the thing I could tri out .Partli becaus of the drone own stabil and an overabund of caution on my part , I never crash it , but it did flip over onc becaus I land too quickli while tri to keep it from be grab by a curiou dog .Over all , I can not complain  spring is here , and the citi , thank , ha a lot of green space for drone fli . Also , I have a coupl of vacat plan , and I am alreadi think about how best to use my birthday present .', 'When the next financi crisi hit , big American bank will not be abl to reli on their intern lifeboat .That wa the takeaway on Wednesday after feder regul reject some banks so-cal live will , which show how major financi institut would be wound down in a crisi .

JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley , whose live will wa found not credibl by onli the Fed , are among the bank that count on help from foreign unit . It a problem becaus oversea govern could ring-fenc the bank in their jurisdict in a pinch .

Or that a six-ounc bag of Zuke Lil Link pork and appl sausag bit ever cost more than dinner at a five-star restaur ?It all part of the bizarr world of Internet discount ,  which let retail and brand assert that you are get a stupend deal becaus someon somewher els  exactli where is never explain  is be charg much more .The root of some of these so-cal discount is a phenomenon known as list price ( also known as manufacturer suggest retail price , or M.S.R.P. , and by variou other name ) , which The New York Time document in a recent articl . List price is a larg fictiti concept , promot by the brand or manufactur and adopt by the retail to compel the custom into push the buy button .So if you are the sort of consum who care about such thing , how can you guard against such pressur ?

That will make it much harder for custom to judg independ if they are get a deal or mere be encourag to think so .First , realiz that the problem is at least as pervas onlin as offlin  and even less regul .

It less than I expect , actual ,  said Dave Rekuc , Ripen director of market . Consid you can basic name your own list price.Vendor enter the list price into their Amazon data , which make the system a self-regul one , Mr. Rekuc said . That appar explain deal like the one for a G.E . cordless phone batteri sold by an outfit call Sale Store and ship by Amazon . The product page offer to knock $ 829 off the list price , proclaim You save 100 percent.Some e-commerc expert said noth need to be done about illusori discount , becaus the merchant need them so much .The process can seem dishonest to consum , but let consid the retailer side ,  said Daniel Green of CamelCamelCamel.com , an oddli name but use site that track Amazon price . If they werent use the list price as the benchmark , what would they use ? Retail could choos the most recent price as the comparison , Mr. Green said , but then they would just jack the price way up befor the sale . Im not sure there a good solut here , particularli as consum appar respond to larg M.S.R.P.-base discounts.A few retail defend themselv in off-the-record convers by say there are no victim here .

Mi guess is the answer would be no.Her site track litig against the retail . Wayfair , an onlin furnitur retail , ha been su in a price case that is pend . A case against Amazon falter becaus it custom waiv their right to sue in favor of arbitr .Perhap the onli real consum safeguard is to labori compar price .

It part of a bigger trend of ride-hail , with servic find way to captur a veri specif market segment , said Harri Campbel , who write about the industri at hi blog TheRideShareGuy.com and is a driver for Uber and Lyft .There is Wingz , which special in airport ride ; Lift Hero , which provid ride to older consum ; and Chariot for Women , set to start thi month in Boston , aim to serv women or children under age 13 .Full-tim work mother start HopSkipDr , which serv all of Lo Angel Counti and much of Orang Counti . The compani ha receiv $ 14.1 million in fund and said revenu wa grow 30 percent monthli . It wa preced by Shuddl , which began in 2014 and ha rais $ 12 million . [ Updat : Shuddl ceas oper on April 15 ] .To help reassur worri parent , these compani provid a level of safeti and secur that the Uber of the world do not , includ fingerprint and extens interview , and they use softwar that monitor the driver speed and conduct . Mani compani oper in California also reli on TrustLin certif , that state offici screen program for in-hom caregiv .Almost all the driver for these servic are women  often teacher , nanni , day care worker and mother . Most compani carri insur that exce state requir and cover liabil relat to driver ( or babysitt ) conduct .These nich start-up are also come up at a time when there is industri skeptic about whether on-demand servic can offer price and conveni competit for the long term .To a certain extent , mani of these start-up still compet against Uber or Lyft becaus mani driver for those compani dont know about the unaccompanied-minor polici or choos to look the other way onc they have pick up an underag passeng . I would say between 10 and 20 percent of ride are minor and it increas ,  said Mr. Campbel , who correspond with hundr of driver a day becaus of hi blog .As parent tri these servic , they are becom more comfort with the idea of allow a stranger to drive their children . Ms. Aluis , for instanc , receiv a photo of the car and driver ahead of time , which she place insid her daughter lunchbox . The driver wear a HopSkipDr shirt and use a password that confirm her ident to Emma .Ms. Aluis receiv a text messag when her daughter get in the car and when she arriv at her destin , and dure that time Emma is never unsupervis . Last year Ms. Aluis spent $ 150 a week for her babysitt to pick Emma up twice a week from school . I didnt know anyth about her car either , so that wa a littl terrifi ,  she said .Word-of-mouth market and referr are crucial . Mom network are veri import for us ,  said Joanna McFarland , a co-found and the chief execut of HopSkipDr . We have found that when you solv one parent problem and make their life easier , they will tell other parents.Ride-hail for children appear to have start in 2013 with Boost , a youth transport servic creat by the busi innov group at Mercedes-Benz Research and Develop North America in Sunnyval , Calif. Boost serv the Silicon Valley area and is still consid a pilot program , although it grow at a rate of 10 percent annual . Children are transport in Mercedes-own van , driver are certifi bu driver , and there is a concierg on board to accompani children and engag them dure the drive .Sinc then , entrepreneur have offer addit servic to consum as they tri to set themselv apart from the competit . Zum , which start in Januari in the San Francisco Bay Area , provid babysit , if need , in conjunct with ride for children age 5 to 15 . One of it driver , for exampl , help a singl mother  who ha a 9 a.m. board meet each week  by arriv 45 minut earli to babysit her 5-year-old daughter , give her breakfast and get her to school , walk her to class and ensur she is settl befor leav .Zum just complet a seed round of fund for a littl more than $ 1 million . Dure it earli phase , revenu and custom were grow 65 percent month over month . Today , the compani provid 150 to 200 ride a day .Like other start-up , Zum allow parent to schedul ride ahead of time ( even for the entir year ) or call for an on-demand ride . All of Zum driver work either a morn or afternoon shift for five to six hour a day , so they rare drive for other servic , said Ritu Narayan , a co-found of the compani while she wa a group product manag at eBay .One compani in thi sector ha alreadi reposit itself in respons to custom feedback . Kango , which serv the San Francisco Bay Area , start as KangaDo , a platform for parent seek car pool in their neighborhood . Although that function still exist , the compani chang it model after parent said they want nonshar ride for their children and babysit servic . New custom can interview driver or take a preliminari ride with them , which help younger children get comfort with a driver befor take a solo ride .Mani of these compani have modest expans plan , in larg part becaus of the need to hire well-vet driver .It take a lot of work to keep suppli and demand in balanc , to keep the driver pool match to the custom pool and remain 100 percent reliabl , so wev taken veri pragmat view on growth ,  said Doug Aley , chief execut of Shuddl . The demand is there , but it not the same as in other industri . If you dont get your groceri deliv it not the end of the world , but wer talk about someone child.The extra safeti and secur measur as well as other featur translat to ride that are , on averag , more expens than a ride with Lyft or Uber . For exampl , HopSkipDrive ride are about 10 to 15 percent higher and Kango roughli 15 to 20 percent higher .Still , higher fare are not seen as a deterr becaus thi busi is driven , in part , by a forc more power than econom .One factor in thi market peopl dont talk about is the guilt ,  said Ms. McFarland of HopSkipDr . There no shortag of that.', 'Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act requir larg bank hold compani to submit resolut plans popularli known as live will  that show how these compani can be resolv if they fail in a bankruptci court like everi other busi .On Wednesday , we learn that five of the biggest financi institut were unabl to meet thi standard , as judg by both the Feder Deposit Insur Corpor and the Feder Reserv . Two other were found to have fail by one of the regul , but the other regul had no seriou object to the proffer plan .In short , most of the American bank that submit live will last Juli have again fail to pass the test . The onli one to pass in thi round wa Citigroup . And even it did not pass the test with fli color .But the public ha no real way of know whi Citigroup pass , and the other all fail , becaus the public portion of the plan is so gener that onli with a close read can ani differ be discern . And even then it not clear if those distinct are real or simpli the result of too much time spent reread a text for possibl insight .There is a strong , usual unstat suspicion that draft a truli credibl live will is imposs under the current bankruptci code , especi given that the rule , quit rightli , provid for no assum public fund . In some sens , the financi industri ha onli itself to blame for the latter condit , becaus it success lobbi against a prefund resolut fund in 2010 when Dodd-Frank wa under consider .In ani event , if the suspicion is correct , what do we make of Citigroup , which ha passed thi round ?Cynic , includ mani bankruptci lawyer , will say that a plan that is credibl to a bank regul might not be credibl to a bankruptci lawyer , or more import , a bankruptci judg .Fair enough . We realli do not know where the F.D.I.C . and the Feder Reserv are get their Chapter 11 advic . They clearli have lot of smart peopl work at those organ , but they are not well known for reorgan experi , especi given that bank are expressli carv out of the bankruptci code .But I think the focu on bankruptci experi avoid a more seriou issu . If inde Citigroup ha discov the secret to a proper live will , shouldnt that be share with the broader univers of jumbo financi institut ?And shouldnt it be share with the broader market , so it can evalu the regulators work ? After all , the goal is to subject these big financi institut to the same market disciplin that all other compani face .Onli then can we realli say that we have end too big to fail.', 'Unless everi poll is wildli wrong , Donald Trump is go to win in New York on Tuesday , and he go to win big . But exactli how he win realli matter . A few vote here or there could make the differ between a solid or shaki road to the Republican nomin .New York 95 deleg would keep Mr. Trump on a narrow path to avoid a contest convent . But New York award it deleg in a fairli unusu way : proport but with a 50 percent winner-take-al trigger for each district and for the pool of statewid deleg . So Mr. Trump would need 50 percent of the vote statewid and in each congression district to win all of the deleg .To win 50 percent of the vote statewid , he need to run up the score in the rel Republican area where he expect to do well : Staten Island , Long Island and upstat New York .But to maxim hi deleg haul , he need convinc win in everi congression district  includ in some of the most Democrat place in the countri . Everi pocket of weak could cost him deleg .If you dont want to get too far into the detail of New York , the easi thing to watch is whether Mr. Trump is win 50 percent of the vote statewid . If he clear 50 percent , it mean he get all 14 of the statewid deleg ; it would probabl mean he would also clear 50 percent in mani or most of the state 27 congression district . All thing consid , if he went over 50 percent statewid , he would probabl win at least 75 deleg .Everi recent survey show Mr. Trump clear 50 percent of the vote , with mani of the most recent survey even place him in the mid-50 .He is probabl so strong in part becaus he ha been a ubiquit presenc in New York for decad . But the state demograph also favor him ; he would have a veri real shot to get 50 percent of the vote in New York even with no home-st advantag .New York isnt quit perfect for him  even hi strongest area have averag or above-averag educ attain . But it a lot like highli educ Massachusett , which gave Mr. Trump 49 percent of the vote and ha been hi best state so far .Mr. Trump fare best in place that look noth like the old Republican Parti . New Yorker arent veri religi , they have low marriag rate , and theyr less like to work in the old resource-bas economi . They are far more like to be Cathol than Republican nationwid . It the sort of place where a Republican from 1950 might look around and think that America need to be made great again .These strength make Mr. Trump a favorit to clear 50 percent in congression district on Staten Island and Long Island , along with mani district in upstat New York , accord to a demographic-bas statist model of Mr. Trump support . Over all , our model place Mr. Trump just short of 50 percent statewid ; the model may underestim him a bit becaus it doesnt account for a home-st edg .Hi best district might be New York 11th , which includ Staten Island and which ha mani voter of Italian ancestri . The model estim hell receiv 58 percent of the vote there .It might seem strang to focu on someth like Italian ancestri , but the number of voter with ancestri from predominantli Roman Cathol countri in Europ ( like Itali , Ireland or Spain ) is one of the strongest driver of Mr. Trump support . Convers , a high share of voter with ancestri from Protest northwest Europ ( like England , Germani or the Netherland ) ha predict lack of support . Unsurprisingli , Mr. Trump support in the area includ two promin Cathol politician , Rudi Giuliani and Chri Christi .Mr. Trump might fare nearli as well in upstat New York , but here demograph alon suggest Mr. Trump might have a harder time reach 50 percent .Thi may be a bit surpris ; Mr. Trump ha receiv a lot of high-profil endors from upstat New York . One possibl is that hi strength there is a littl bit of an illus : Mr. Trump support may make up a particularli larg share of the popul ( sinc there are more Republican upstat ) , but they might not repres quit as larg a share of Republican as they do in a more Democrat region like Long Island .What clear is that these upstat district  there are nine or so , depend on your definit of upstat  matter a lot . Not onli doe he need the extra deleg , but these district also have larg number of regist Republican . He need to win easili here to help secur 50 percent of the statewid vote .To realli win big , and claim nearli all of New York deleg , Mr. Trump wont just need to clear 50 percent statewid with strong show in upstat New York and Long Island ; hell need to fare well closer to Manhattan , where hi advantag rapidli fade .Hi strength start to tick downward in Westchest Counti and on the north side of Long Island , where white voter are better educ and where old-money enclav start to eat into Mr. Trump biggest advantag .The disadvantag grow even greater in New York Citi ( outsid Staten Island ) , where white voter are among the best educ in the countri .Mr. Trump biggest challeng are five well-educ congression district near or includ Manhattan  the 9th , 10th , 7th , 12th and 13th District .The 12th District white voter , which includ the Upper East Side , are the best educ in the countri ; the 13th , which includ most of Manhattan north of 96th Street ( but not Columbia Univers ) , rank fifth . Mr. Trump ha tend to struggl in area like these : He lost the affluent white ward on Chicago north side to John Kasich .Inde , the model estim that Mr. Trump will lose sever of these New York Citi district to Mr. Kasich or perhap Ted Cruz . Whether that happen matter a lot : New York Citi may not have mani Republican , but it ha a lot of congression district . If it turn out that Mr. Trump is weak here , it could prevent him from get much more than 80 deleg , even if he easili clear 50 percent statewid .But Mr. Trump could do better here than one would guess from the area demograph . These area are heavili Democrat  it possibl that the Republican voter in these area are noth like the overal popul of white adult ( the model use censu data for non-Hispan white , sinc Republican voter are overwhelmingli white ) .For exampl , the larg number of Republican Orthodox Jew in the otherwis heavili Democrat 8th , 9th , 10th and 12th District could easili vote veri differ than one would guess from statist on the broader popul .A differ version of the same analyt challeng occur in place where nonwhit voter repres a larg share or even a major of Republican voter .The model , reli on data from white voter ( who will still repres the major of Republican voter in most of these district ) , make Mr. Trump a clear favorit in all of the district where nonwhit voter repres a major of adult citizen , except for New York 12th District  which includ the Upper East Side .There reason to think Mr. Trump realli is a favorit in these nonwhit area . He carri all of the major Hispan ward in Chicago , includ those with the smallest number of non-Hispan white .He could likewis win the overwhelmingli nonwhit district of New York . If so , just a hand of voter in some of the most heavili Democrat area of the countri could swing sever deleg .The result is an overal pictur that quit uncertain , even as Mr. Trump is all but assur to win easili . In the worst case for him , he win someth like 48 or 49 percent of the vote ( with strength in place like Long Island and Staten Island , but without clear 50 percent in part of upstat New York and with weak in mani New York Citi district . ) He would receiv as few as 60 or so deleg .Even if he clear 50 percent over all , a few pocket of weak in heavili Democrat , well-educ or divers stretch of New York Citi could cost him 15 deleg . There veri littl way to know whether hell win these deleg base on the poll becaus so few of the state Republican voter live in these area .', 'Stock climb again Wednesday as quarterli result from JPMorgan Chase gave bank a lift .Econom news from China power industri and technolog compani in the Unit State and stock exchang oversea .JPMorgan Chase , the largest bank in the Unit State , led a ralli in financi stock after it first-quart result came in better than analyst expect .

Even wors than work at an invest bank , howev , is invest in one .For starter , there are few public compani that are less sharehold friendli than a Wall Street one . They seem to exist primarili for the benefit of the peopl who work at them , not the peopl who own them . Gener speak , 40 percent to 50 percent of everi dollar of revenu gener by these compani goe to employe compens , which leav far less net incom for sharehold .Wall Street profit is a shadow of what it onc wa . In the first quarter , Goldman Sachs return on equiti wa 6.5 percent and Morgan Stanley wa 6.4 percent . For comparison , in the year befor Goldman went public in 1999 , it return on equiti wa often around 70 percent . As a result of thi shift , Wall Street compani trade at a fraction of their book valu .Despit all thi , J. Daniel Plant , a former merger banker at Goldman Sach and JPMorgan Chase , smell opportun . Mr. Plant is the founder of Voce Capit Manag , a small hedg fund base in San Francisco that occasion engag in sharehold activ . ( Disclosur : Mr. Plant and I use to work togeth at JPMorgan more than 15 year ago . )Voce ha start a proxi fight at an Arlington , Va. , invest bank that use to be call Friedman , Bill , Ramsey . In the last year or so , Voce ha built up a 5.3 percent stake in what is now call FBR & Compani . The proxi battl aim to oust three of it director and instal Mr. Plant ; Jarl Berntzen , anoth former Goldman Sach banker ; and Michael J. McConnel , a former manag director at Shamrock Capit Advisors $ 1 billion activist fund and a former banker at Kidder , Peabodi . FBR annual meet , while not yet schedul , ha tradit been in late May .FBR wa onc a big success , but it glori day seem to have fade with the departur over time of it three founder . The compani ha a market valu of around $ 140 million . But it also ha cash on it balanc sheet of $ 70 million , plu privat equiti and hedg fund invest that it valu at anoth $ 90 million or so , lead Mr. Plant to conclud that the market is valu the company bank busi at close to zero . In a 67-page present , he say the compani is worth less today than when the current manag team took over in Januari 2009 .Voce is FBR third-largest investor , behind NWQ Invest Manag and the Robeco Group Boston Partner . ( Manag own about 15 percent of FBR on a fulli dilut basi . ) Mr. Plant ha met with the compani more than 10 time in the last year to tri to understand it strategi . But after month of tri to persuad FBR manag to return to the company highli profit root as the lead underwrit of arcan privat place secur that big institut investor can trade among themselv , Mr. Plant ha gotten nowher .Thi month , he decid to take hi campaign public . With some hyperbol , Mr. Plant say FBR is a Tiffani brand that ha lost it way but can still be saved.A spokesman for FBR declin to comment .Mr. Plant direct much of hi frustrat as a sharehold toward Richard J. Hendrix , FBR chief execut . Mr. Plant say that from the outset of Mr. Hendrix tenur , he ha not been content with run a boutiqu invest bank . Instead , he ha tri to mimic other invest bank like the former Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrett , which wa bought by Credit Suiss in 2000 , or Jefferi , a subsidiari of the Leucadia Nation Corpor , Mr. Plant say .The company gone on a massiv hire and acquisit spree to tri to becom the next D.L.J . or Jefferi ,  Mr. Plant tell me , even though there no possibl way that will ever succeed. He say he think FBR ha made a big mistak take on high-end offic real estat such as 299 Park Avenu in Manhattan , 1 Intern Place in Boston and 1 Embarcadero Center in San Francisco . He is especi critic of Mr. Hendrix compens , which ha ad up to more than $ 21 million sinc he becam chief execut in 2009 , Mr. Plant say , despit neg sharehold returns.Mr. Plant argu that FBR should return to it root in underwrit privat placement secur and focu on it tradit strength advis compani in the real estat and financi servic industri . It should abandon it effort , he say , in the consum , media , telecom , technolog and health care industri , where the competit from bigger bank is fierc .He say he also think FBR compens is out of control . In 2015 , $ 77 million , or 64 percent of FBR net revenu of $ 120 million , wa paid out in compens and benefit . Contrast that with FBR seem failur as a merger and acquisit advis . In 2015 , the compani gener a mere $ 9.5 million in advisori fee .You rais a billion dollar for some compani and you cant get hire to do M. & A . ; for them ?  he say . They are just leav money on the tabl by not mine their relationships.It is unclear how Mr. Plants assault on FBR will play out , of cours  he ha lost around $ 1.5 million on hi invest so far  but at a time when so mani peopl are make assert about the futur of Wall Street , it is refresh to see one activist investor put forward a blueprint to return one wayward compani to the root of it former glori .', 'Q .

Union worker counter that the strike will impair Verizon abil to deliv qualiti custom servic , includ servic call and equip instal .Here a guid to which consum may be affect , who wont and how ani disrupt might manifest itself .Which servic will be affect ?The union gener repres worker for Verizon wirelin oper , which includ the company landlin , high-spe Internet and televis servic . These servic are mostli avail onli in the Northeast , includ Massachusett , Rhode Island and the region from southern New York to Virginia . Verizon offer home wirelin servic in part of nine state , serv about 15 million phone line . The union worker perform a rang of task , like fix a phone line that out of servic , instal new phone and broadband Internet line , or field custom support call .Union worker say they plan to picket some Verizon Wireless store , but onli a small number of those employe are part of the union .In other word , subscrib to Verizon cellular phone and data servic should not notic ani chang . There should be no major differ when you call Verizon Wireless or go into a retail store with question about your cellphon bill , data usag or upgrad to a new smartphon , for exampl .How might wirelin servic be affect by the strike ?Verizon say consum need not worri about the potenti strike . We went through veri extens , good train and wer veri confid that wer more than readi to meet the need of our custom ,  said Raymond McConvil , a Verizon spokesman .But judg from number alon , Verizon wirelin custom can reason expect a deterior in custom servic qualiti . Even with prepar , the compani said it had train onli upward of 10,000 employe to fill in for the nearli 36,000 worker who went on strike . In addit , mani union worker who are strike have been do thi type of work for far longer than the one year that Verizon ha train nonunion worker to fill in .There will almost certainli be some function which may be slower or unavail dure the strike , becaus they requir special skill or there just arent suffici altern resourc avail to fill all function ,  said Jan Dawson , an independ technolog analyst for Jackdaw Research .Whi is Verizon tighten the belt on wirelin servic ?Revenu for Verizon wireless busi ha grown healthili , wherea sale in it wirelin busi are shrink slightli . For wirelin servic , Verizon focus on build out a strong custom base in the Northeast , but it sold it wirelin asset in other state , includ California , Florida and Texa .In other word , Verizon ha a small , concentr wirelin busi compar with it nationwid wireless servic , and it is put more money into wireless resourc .How long could servic be disrupt ?Indefinit . Verizon union worker have not specifi how long they might go on strike , so it could last hour , day , week or even month .Will thi affect my util bill ?Mr. McConvil said the strike would have no effect on consumers bill .', 'The roughli 36,000 Verizon worker who went on strike Wednesday as a contract disput enter it ninth month have brought into sharp relief one of the most fundament question face the Unit State : Can an economi in the throe of dizzi technolog chang be a sourc of new middle-class job for blue-collar worker ?The compani , which is seek rule chang that would make it easier to outsourc work , seem to cast some doubt on that proposit , through it action if not it word . It argu that technolog chang and shift in consum demand have render self-def mani of the promis made to worker a gener or two ago .Our object in these negoti is to preserv good job with competit wage and excel benefit while address the need of our ever-chang busi ,  Lowel C. McAdam , Verizon chief execut , wrote in an essay post on LinkedIn . But nostalgia for the rotari phone era wont save American job , ani more than ignor the global forc reshap the auto industri save the Detroit automak . Wer determin not to find ourselv in that same boat.The two union involv , whose member at Verizon current earn an averag of $ 130,000 a year in wage and benefit , insist thi level of compens can be not just sustain but share with more worker , if onli it were a higher prioriti . The compani , they point out , is highli profit and sell servic that consum are clamor for .The biggest issu in thi conflict is tri to preserv good job ,  said Bob Master , assist to the vice presid of District 1 at the Commun Worker of America , one of the union on strike .Both side have a point . Over 99 percent of the strike employe work on the so-cal wirelin side of it busi  that is , the tradit phone landlin and the fiber optic network , call Fio , which offer subscrib Internet , voic and video servic . It is a busi where growth is slow or declin , as more and more consum give up landlin and tradit subscript televis . Profit are low .The wirelin busi gener about 29 percent of Verizon revenu in 2015 , but account for onli 7 percent of it oper incom .By contrast , the wireless busi , which is larg not union and where wage and benefit for rank-and-fil worker are lower on averag , is boom and highli profit . Over the last few year , Verizon wireless busi ha consist grown at least 7 percent a year , wherea it wirelin busi ha shrunk slightli  in the last year , about 2 percent .At the same time , Verizon wireless margin are the highest in the industri . More than 40 cent of everi dollar of revenu on the wireless side becom cash flow .Verizon strateg decis reflect these diverg fortun . In the last few year it ha reduc invest in it wirelin oper , even sell oper in California , Florida and Texa last year for $ 10.54 billion to Frontier Commun .At thi point it treat wirelin as a sort of cash cow rather than someth to be invest in heavili , wherea wireless is where the futur growth is ,  said Jan Dawson , an independ technolog analyst for Jackdaw Research .Verizon ha place a big bet on the futur of the wireless busi . In 2013 , Verizon Commun paid $ 130 billion to take full control of Verizon Wireless , in which it had previous share ownership with Vodafon of Britain .Yet these broad trend obscur some of the way that Verizon could sustain and expand good-pay work even on the wirelin side . Foremost is Fio , wide regard as state of the art when it come to broadband network , and which the union and the compani agre can serv as a foundat for sustain desir job .But Verizon remain ambival about Fio . In 2004 the compani pledg to lay fiber that could serv as mani as 18 million home . It fulfil that plan accord to it own measur , but ha shown littl desir in move much beyond it , leav sever million household with littl hope of get access to the network . Until Verizon announc on Tuesday that it would be make Fio avail throughout Boston , it had been sever year sinc the compani had commit itself to a major expans .Ian Olgeirson , an analyst at the media research firm SNL Kagan , said one reason for thi reluct to expand is that the rise price of televis program ha put pressur on margin for video , which make the econom of the entir fiber optic invest less attract .Still , there continu to be great demand for the broadband servic , where margin are quit high . And while compani that invest in fiber optic like to see good return on multipl servic rather than just one to justifi the expens , Mr. Olgeirson note that some of Verizon competitor have not been deter by thi issu .You do see evid of a littl more enthusiasm for the wirelin busi at AT & T ; ,  Mr. Olgeirson said .Given the potenti social benefit of a broadband expans  in term of both job for those work on the network and opportun for those use it  mani expert see a rational for a govern role in at least nudg the process forward , even if the econom are too challeng for privat carrier to undertak on their own . But thi ha not been forthcom either .The F.C.C . doesnt have an effect polici to build out broadband in the U.S. ,  said Jeffrey Keef , a professor emeritu at the Rutger School of Manag and Labor Relat , who ha studi the telecom industri for decad . Fio is a state-of-the-art broadband network . The F.C.C . ha not provid the appropri incentives.The two union  the second is the Intern Brotherhood of Electr Worker  have made no secret of their intent to also open a polit front in the disput . After the New York Citi govern audit Verizon perform in build out it fiber optic network there , union leader ask the Citi Council to hold hear .The union also procur a letter from 14 mayor about the fiber optic issu and one from 20 Unit State senat urg Verizon to act as a respons corpor citizen and negoti fairli with it worker .The purpos of the strike are to build public support for the worker and to put pressur on the politician and the regul to put pressur on Verizon to settl thi thing ,  Professor Keef said .Even as the union seek to build support from outsid , they argu intern that there are sever categori of job that could sustain middle-class lifestyl if the compani were will to think about them differ . One of the major point of content between Verizon and it union are call center . The compani current outsourc some of it custom servic and sale call to center in lower-cost region of the Unit State , and it is propos rule chang that would allow it to do more of thi .But the cost save that outsourc call center appear to offer often prove illusori . Rosemari Batt , a professor at the ILR School of Cornel Univers who ha extens studi the move of servic work to call center , say turnov is lower and perform and custom satisfact are substanti higher when the work is done in-hous .There are real opportun to increas revenu by bundl and packag differ product ,  she said , give an exampl . But you need a more sophist work forc that train and commit to the compani to do that well . Outsourc is penny-wis but pound-foolish.To be sure , the compani is hardli oblivi to the good-job question . It is not seek wage concess , and offici there express genuin enthusiasm at the econom benefit that Fio confer on it worker . Tami Erwin , presid of Verizon consum and mass busi unit , emphas in an interview that the Boston expans would mean a lot of great high-pay work.But despit that expans , the company overal postur doe not appear to be intend to pursu a busi model that maxim the number of middle-class incom it produc . Ask about the possibl benefit of keep call center worker in-hous , Ms. Erwin said : It my respons to make sure wev creat an environ where peopl have the right tool , the right resourc . If we do that , it doesnt matter whether theyr a contractor or an employee.', 'The White Hous recent issu an execut order , support by a report from the Council of Econom Advis , discov that monopoli is on the rise and direct feder agenc to look for way to bolster competit and control specif anti-competit abus .The announc invit an appreci post in The New York Time by Paul Krugman and ha prompt some day of debat among economist and antitrust lawyer . It no doubt reflect the grow frustrat of voter , increas evid of seriou problem in domest competit and the increasingli substanti possibl that the lack of it contribut to America alarm incom inequ .Thing are bad enough that call for tougher competit are heard from such unlik sourc as The Economist and reportedli establishment presidenti candid .The order , howev , is all rather frustrat to those toil in the regrett dusti precinct of antitrust polici , especi come from a presid who so rais our hope . In hi first presidenti campaign , Mr. Obama promis to direct hi administr to reinvigor antitrust enforc ,  sinc antitrust is the American way to make capit work for consumers.It would be frustrat enough that the initi seem certain of fairli complet failur , for reason back by a hundr year of histori and evid . It is direct to sector-specif feder agenc , which by and larg have no antitrust enforc power and have almost alway use their power to keep competit at bay .Moreov , initi under the order will probabl be piecem , small and easili evad . Consid what appar is the sole initi the govern ha plan so far , a call on the Feder Commun Commiss to regul cabl TV box . ( A request to be made by that stalwart champion of the consum interest , the Commerc Depart . ) Those box may be overpr , but will control that one littl thing realli keep cabl compani from make it up somewher els ?But the real reason thi effort is so sting is that it come as an all but explicit admiss of the administration failur to enforc the antitrust law , which have been on the book for 130 year .By take step like approv an airlin merger that on one estim will caus consum injuri of a $ 1 billion or more a year ( an estim I extrapol from Tabl 7 of thi remark report , by no less than a former Obama antitrust offici , who wa not involv in approv of the deal and ha call it a mistak ) , administr of both parti for some decad have paint us into a corner .Market are now so concentr and ripe for abus , and the polit will for enforc so lack , that our antitrust law seem increasingli hopeless . So we resort instead to some small regulatori intervent to tame a beast we could have kept from creat by just enforc antitrust in the first place .Perhap worst is that thi new step break with what wa a proudli liber tradit . Howev much Republican may congratul themselv for deregul ,  the movement to displac our onetim system of rate-and-entri regul and replac it with antitrust wa an affair domin by liber hero : Ralph Nader ; Senat Howard Metzenbaum ; Senat Ted Kennedi ; the economist and airlin regul Alfr Kahn ; Jimmi Carter antitrust chief , John H.

China is now tri to partli wean itself off coal to improv air qualiti .The bankruptci file came as no surpris after the compani announc last month that it wa delay interest payment on two loan . It come after a number of bankruptci file over the last two year by other coal compani , includ industri giant like Arch Coal , Patriot Coal , Walter Energi and Alpha Natur Resourc .Thi wa a difficult decis , but it is the right path forward for Peabodi ,  Glenn Kellow , the company presid and chief execut , said in a statement . Thi process enabl us to strengthen liquid and reduc debt , build upon the signific oper achiev wev made in recent year , and lay the foundat for long-term stabil and success in the future.The collaps in natur ga price over the last three year and new environment regul by the Obama administr have led to a rapid declin of the industri , especi in the Appalachia region , where mine are deep and expens to oper . Domest product last year slump to a three-decad low .Coal wa onc the provid of roughli half of the nation power , but it wa surpass by natur ga as the No . 1 sourc of electr for the first time a year ago .The Pari climat agreement sign in Decemb ha convinc mani investor that the coal industri is in a death spiral . At the same time , there is a glut of coal on global market , in part becaus of uneven econom growth in Europ and emerg market .But mani analyst say the bankruptci file do not mean the coal industri will disappear . Under Chapter 11 bankruptci protect law , the compani have been exchang debt to lender for equiti in the compani , known in financi parlanc as a debt-for-equ swap .Most energi expert say coal will probabl provid as much as a third of the nation power for year to come . They point out that sever European and Asian countri continu to reli on coal for electr , even as they tri to turn more to renew power sourc like wind and solar .Peabodi still produc coal for custom in 25 countri on six contin .It a veri mix pictur ,  said Daniel Yergin , the energi historian and vice chairman of IH , the energi consult firm . Coal plant in the U.S. will continu to retir , but coal will continu to be part of electr gener in the Unit States.He ad , China plan , even with it renew push , still show a rise in coal consumption.Peabody debt troubl , which have been standard across an industri that bet heavili on China and other intern market , origin in a 2011 offer of more than $ 4 billion for Macarthur Coal , an Australian supplier of metallurg coal for Asian steel mill .But expect for grow Asian economi prove to be unrealist . Growth in steel product in China wa disappoint as the countri began to shift it economi from export toward more domest consumpt . At the same time , India is expand it railroad system to connect it own coal field to domest industri .Now , with the industri in near free fall , mani bank are pull away from financ coal project . Util are close age coal-fir power plant rather than upgrad them to meet new environment standard , in larg part becaus the glut of natur ga ha offer a cheaper altern .While file for protect for it American asset in Feder Bankruptci Court in the Eastern District of Missouri , Peabodi disclos that it ha had problem sell hold in Colorado and New Mexico . Peabody last best hope to avert bankruptci wa it attempt to sell three mine to Bowi Resourc Partner , but that compani ha had troubl rais the full $ 650 million in debt to acquir them .Not surprisingli , environmentalist who have been lead an effort to persuad investor and bank to divest from coal cheer the new bankruptci .Peabodi Energy bankruptci is a harbing of the end of the fossil fuel era ,  said Jenni Marienau , Unit State divest campaign manag with 350.org . Peabodi is crash becaus the compani wa unwil to chang with the time  they doubl down on the dirtiest of all fossil fuel , and investor back their bet , as the world shift toward renew energy.Peabodi is cut it payrol and otherwis curb cost . Late last month , it cut 235 hourli and salari employe from it North Antelop Rochel mine in the Powder River Basin , roughli 15 percent of the mine work forc .Share of the compani have sold for around $ 2 in recent day after plung in valu by 99 percent sinc it high in 2008 just befor the financi crisi .', 'My wife and I both work . When one of our children wake up complain of a sore throat , we could begin a ritual stare-down to determin which of us is go to have to wait for the doctor offic to open , make the phone call , wait on hold , schedul an appoint ( which will inevit be in the middl of the day ) , take off work , pick up the child from school , sit in the wait room ( surround by other sick children ) , get the rapid strep test , find out if the child is infect and then go to the pharmaci or back to school , befor return to work .Or , one of us could just take the child to a retail clinic on the way to work and be done in 30 minut . Strep throat is incred easi to treat ( Penicillin still work great ! ) . There a simpl and veri fast test for it . Moreov , physician are realli bad at diagnos some of these common ill clinic ; a studi found that a doctor guess as to whether a respiratori infect is bacteri or viral is right about 50 percent of the time  no better than flip a coin . The point is , you need to get the rapid strep test everi time regardless , whether at your doctor offic or at a clinic .Aime and I choos the retail clinic everi time .Whi ? Conveni is the biggest reason . Mani doctors offic are open onli on weekday and dure busi hour . Thi also happen to be when most adult work and when children attend school . A 2010 survey of 11 countri found that American seek out after-hour care or care in a hospital emerg room more often than citizen of almost ani other industri nation . More than two-third of American with a below-averag incom did so . But thi isnt just a problem for the poor . About 55 percent of those with an above-averag incom did so as well .We complain all the time that peopl use the emerg room for primari care . But that not alway about lack of insur . It about access . The emerg room is open when peopl can actual go . Emerg room use ha gone up , not down , sinc the passag of the Afford Care Act . More peopl have insur , and now can afford care when they need it .That care is also come from retail clinic , usual found either in stand-alon storefront or insid pharmaci . Between 2007 and 2009 , retail clinic use increas 10-fold . It turn out that my wife and I repres America pretti well . About 35 percent of retail visit for children are for pharyng  sore throat . Add in ear infect and upper respiratori infect , and youv account for more than three-quart of visit for children . Parent bring their children to retail clinic to take care of quick , acut problem . Swap ear infect for immun , and youv got the main reason adult use retail clinic , too .Research for a studi publish in the American Journal of Medic Qualiti talk to patient who sought out care at retail clinic . Patient who had a primari care physician , but still went to a retail clinic , did so becaus their primari care doctor were not avail in a time manner . A quarter of them said that if the retail clinic werent avail , theyd go to the emerg room .It understand whi physicians group might be oppos to retail clinic . Abov and beyond the obviou econom loss when a patient goe elsewher , mani primari care physician correctli point out that retail clinic often lack the knowledg and experi that come from continu of care . For mani year , expert have argu that medic home are the optim way to care for children , especi those with chronic condit . Those are primari care doctors offic that offer a comprehens , patient-cent , team-bas , coordin approach . Retail clinic are pretti much the opposit .The American Academi of Pediatr , the American Academi of Famili Physician and The American Medic Associ have all releas polici statement or guidelin that oppos , or at least advis , that use of retail clinic be restrict . That doesnt seem to have deter mani patient .And research hasnt born out mani of the physicians concern . A 2009 studi in the Annal of Intern Medicin examin the cost and qualiti of care deliv at retail clinic compar with physicians offic and urgent care center . It turn out that aggreg qualiti score were similar in all three set , as were patients receipt of prevent care . The cost of visit , howev , wa significantli less in retail clinic : $ 110 versu $ 166 at the doctor offic and $ 156 at the urgent care center .Thi ha led some peopl to believ that these clinic are a viabl way to reduc health care spend . After all , if we can achiev the same qualiti , improv access and spend less , we will have achiev the tripl aim that everyon want . I have argu in the past that thi is almost imposs . Health care system function under the constraint of the iron triangl . If you increas access , and dont let qualiti suffer , it like that spend will increas .A veri recent studi in Health Affair would seem to support my belief . If retail clinic were just use by peopl to substitut less expens visit for more expens one , they might help us to spend less over all . But if they encourag new health care visit that otherwis wouldnt have happen , they could increas spend . That what happen . Research use insur claim from Aetna for more than 13 million enrolle from 2010 through 2012 . They found that 58 percent of visit to retail clinic were for minor issu that hadnt been treat befor . Retail clinic use wa associ , over all , with an increas in spend of $ 14 per person per year .In other word , when peopl found it easier to go to the retail clinic , they lower their threshold for what theyd go to the doctor for . It like that mani of these visit were unnecessari . For exampl , peopl with upper respiratori infect , for the most part , dont need a clinic visit at all . They may not be will to figur out how to squeez in a doctor visit , but they may be will to swing by the retail clinic  and that extra spend in volum overwhelm the save seen per visit .New servic that improv access may wind up increas health care spend . Mani peopl who use retail clinic might be will to make that trade-off . If physician want to reclaim that busi , they will probabl have to offer the same benefit of schedul and effici that retail clinic do . But if we are look for way to reduc our nation health care spend , retail clinic may not be the prescript we need .', 'The world farmer have increas their use of genet modifi crop steadili and sharpli sinc the technolog becam broadli commerci in 1996 .

Bill Frees , scienc polici analyst at the Center for Food Safeti , which gener oppos genet modifi crop , said that the organization report were just total boosterism.The slow of growth in agricultur biotechnolog ha contribut to consolid within the industri , with DuPont and Dow merg and Syngenta be acquir by the China Nation Chemic Corpor . It is also a factor behind Monsanto effort to diversifi , includ through an unsuccess bid to buy Syngenta last year .Over all , the acreag plant with biotech seed in 2015 fell 1 percent global to 444.0 million acr , from 448.5 million acr in 2014 . The crop were grown in 28 countri and use by up to 18 million farmer , most of them small one in develop countri , the report said .

That repres 34 percent of the global commerci seed market , the report said .Most of the genet modifi crop contain gene from bacteria that make the crop resist to certain insect or toler of Roundup or other herbicid . That toler of herbicid can allow farmer to spray those chemic to kill weed without harm the crop .The crop were eagerli adopt from the moment they first becam wide commerci in 1996 , particularli in the Unit State . Global acreag grew year over year , in mani year by doubl digit , until a slowdown in the last two or three year .The Unit State remain the largest grower of such crop in 2015 , with 175.2 million acr plant , down 5.4 million acr from 2014 .

Del Mont Food went even further , say it would elimin ingredi from genet modifi crop in mani of it product .In China and India , grower have wide adopt cotton engin to be resist to insect . But effort to expand the use of biotechnolog to food crop have falter . China ha devot a lot of research into develop it own version of genet engin corn and rice but ha not approv them yet for commerci use .In India , the govern in 2010 impos a moratorium on commerci cultiv of insect-resist brinjal , a type of eggplant .

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. , bought it for $ 91,000 in 1978 .In recent year , the build provid a measur of continu while similar space in Lower Manhattan  includ the Brecht Forum , an institut that held lectur and exhibit focus on the polit left , and 9 Bleecker Street , a countercultur hub  move or close as the area gentrifi .A weaken support column in the Must build wa discov about a decad ago and present a nag problem , howev . Repair were estim at more than $ 1 million , exceed what the owner could easili manag . Mani in the institut were reluct to move , cherish the building histori and worri that sell it would be sell out . But after year of debat , the board unanim agre to sell .Ms. Boghosian , the execut director , had previous led the Nation Lawyer Guild and felt her way through the process , negoti with potenti buyer and help the board evalu whether it made more sens to buy or rent new headquart .The building buyer agre that the institut and it tenant could remain there at no cost through May . The institute board consid buy a build in East Harlem until discov that a coven creat by a previou owner forbad advocaci of abort right or euthanasia from take place there . The board wa also interest in a space abov the Strand bookstor becaus of it proxim to Union Squar , the site of mani polit ralli , but it wa too expens , Ms. Boghosian said . Build with secur measur that requir visitor to show identif were rule out becaus that could rankl activist .In Decemb , the board agre to a five-year leas for $ 35,000 a month on a 6,000-square-foot space on the top floor of a build on Canal Street . All of the institute current tenant will move with it , Ms. Boghosian said . The institut plan to eventu buy a build .Sever Must build tenant said they were reliev that , despit move , they will be abl to maintain relationship with peer in neighbor offic .I think it great that wer all move togeth ,  said Rebecca Centeno , who work with Paper Tiger Televis and Deep Dish TV , tenant that produc independ video report .The offic on Canal Street will be smaller , Ms. Boghosian said , but a larg open central area is meant to encourag collabor . She said that her most press job would be to make sure group leav the Lafayett Street build on time . If they do not , the institut must forfeit $ 1 million .Wer on a realli tight schedul ,  she said . It complic by the fact that we are not one organ but 10 organ , all with quirks.Most larg or heavi item will be dispos of , but one notabl except is the door to the War Resist Leagu offic , which is paint red and cover with sticker . It will be brought to the Canal Street offic as a symbol of the group histori . Other door in the new offic will be paint red , too , Ms. Boghosian said , and a wall will be cover with art and poster from the old build .On a recent afternoon , volunt in the War Resist offic pack dozen of box with paper to be recycl , includ a brochur encourag divest in weapon manufactur . Linda Thurston , the offic manag , said that she wa still adjust to the move .Leav the build is realli rough becaus your workplac becom kind of like your home ,  she said . Inevit Im go to end up here one morn , forget that wev moved.', 'The Unit State Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia Circuit ha shut down a nascent but necessari effort by trial judg to supervis defer prosecut agreement .Prosecutor increasingli reli on the agreement , which usual impos monitor and complianc oblig on busi accus of financi crime or corrupt , as an altern to tri to convict the defend .Under a defer prosecut agreement , if the problem wa , say , sanction evas by a bank , a team of complianc offic in and outsid the bank would spend a few year to make sure that busi with the wrong sort of countri is not miss . If it wa briberi , corpor complianc offic would set up a plan to track corpor expenditur better .Thi minibureaucraci is administ by the prosecutor offic , and it often includ a special monitor to overse the day-to-day work of the project . The defendant own complianc offic are the front line of the enterpris , commit themselv and their compani to better oversight , and report to the prosecutor or the monitor on their effort . If the busi fail to elimin the bad conduct , then it is back to court for a crimin prosecut .It all look a littl bit like the minibureaucraci form under consent decre in institut reform litig . In those case , prison , school district and other govern institut would agre to reform themselv and would agre to permit those aggriev by failur in their reform effort to go to court to enforc complianc with the decre .Think of school desegreg order that requir buse , or fund requir to turn prison that look like plantat into prison that look more like , well , prison . Brandon L. Garrett , a professor at the Univers of Virginia law school , ha explicitli analog defer prosecut agreement to these sort of reform arrang  he call the phenomenon structur reform prosecut .But for institut reform case , court approv consent decre and supervis their fulfil . So far , they have had no role over the approv or the supervis of defer prosecut agreement .Two district court judg have tri to chang thi script . Judg John Gleeson in Brooklyn approv a defer prosecut agreement in the case of charg of money launder by HSBC . The judg declar that he wa not a pot plant and that he would maintain supervisori power over the implementation of the agreement . He direct the govern to file quarterli report on HSBC complianc .Judg Richard J. Leon in Washington , D.C. , evinc repeat skeptic about the laxiti of a defer prosecut agreement impos penalti on a Dutch air servic compani for evad sanction law . Judg Leon declar that he wa entitl to inspect the agreement to protect the integr of the judici process becaus the parti are , in essenc , request the court to lend it judici imprimatur to their D.P.A. He reject the agreement for prosecut so anemically the defend .The new era of supervis , howev , is in troubl . Earlier thi month , the appeal court in the District of Columbia revers Judg Leon . The court reason that reject a defer prosecut agreement wa improp becaus the decis to prosecut a case or to wait befor prosecut the case lay in the discret of the prosecutor . Inde , it found that a differ interpret would imping upon the executive constitut root primaci over crimin charg decisions.Judg Gleeson supervisori effort is also now on appeal .I think the appel court ha gotten it wrong . Judici supervis of regul  and that is precis what a defer prosecut agreement is , a small bore effort at regul  is consist with some of the most fundament principl of administr law .The govern ha a toler argument . Court do not reach into prosecutors offic to review when and who they decid to charg . That is the job of the prosecutor and , ultim , the attorney gener .Nonetheless , someth must chang in the world of defer prosecut agreement . They are increas in number everi year . The threat of punish for noncompli with a defer prosecut agreement is a court order . Professor who have look at the way prosecutor supervis defer prosecut agreement do not like what they see . Prosecutor , moreov , have littl experi with the oversight of a bureaucrat effort , even a littl one .It is no way to run an oversight process . If the govern is go to set up complianc program with the specter of a court order loom at the end , then it should not expect that court will stay out of the process from the begin . That is how regul work in thi countri , and if prosecutor are go to fashion themselv as regul , then they are go to have to take the bitter with the sweet .There is a good argument for judici supervis of a defer prosecut agreement , too . The case remain on the court docket , pursuant to written agreement with the defend , with the approv of the court , for the purpos of allow the defend to demonstr hi good conduct ,  as the Speedi Trial Act put it . If matter like these remain on a court to-do list , judg should be expect to do someth with them .', 'Settlement negoti have hit a snag in the lawsuit challeng the mental compet of the ail media mogul Sumner M.

Consid the market size , whi havent pharmaceut compani rush to develop a vaccin against the deadli parasit that caus it ?The answer is easi : There is no money to be made from a vaccin for poor children who could not possibl pay for inocul .Last year , GlaxoSmithKlin final introduc the world first malaria vaccin for larg pilot test among African children . The move , howev , is not an endors of the profit motiv as a spur for innov . The Bill and Melinda Gate Foundat pick up much of the tab . And Glaxo doe not expect to make money on it invest .The lack of interest of the pharmaceut industri , which gener huge profit protect by a web of patent enforc around the world , rais an import question .Do we need a differ way to spur innov and dissemin new technolog quickli around the world ? Are patent , which reward inventor by provid them with a government-guarante monopoli over their invent for mani year , the best way to encourag new invent ?The question appli to more than how we develop lifesav drug . It ha acquir new urgenc as the world rush to discov and spread new technolog to replac fossil fuel as sourc of energi and stave off impend climat chang .The debat wa center stage in the negoti that led to the Trans-Pacif Partnership trade agreement . The Obama administr , spur by the drug industri , insist that patent protect should be tighten further around the world . But sever other countri argu that they rais excess barrier for poor countri , cost live .The argument is now be echo in the climat debat .Thi wa a veri contenti issu in the intern climat negoti lead up to the summit in Pari in Decemb ,  said Robert N. Stavin from the Kennedi School of Govern at Harvard . He wa a coordin lead author of the chapter about intern cooper in the latest assess report by the Intergovernment Panel on Climat Chang .A group of countri led by India argu for transfer intellectu properti right for clean energi technolog to develop nation to acceler their diffus . Professor Stavin offer a counterargu : In the long term , if there are no properti right , it will destroy the incent to develop the next gener of technologies.The battl against climat chang is young . There is littl empir evid of the effect of patent on clean energi technolog . But the evid from other industri in which intellectu properti protect have been ratchet up in the name of innov offer a decidedli mix pictur .Take the World Trade Organization 22-year-old Agreement on Trade-Rel Aspect of Intellectu Properti Right , known as Trip , the world first enforc deal to protect patent global . Develop countri were told it would promot their access to innov . Multin would be more like to sell or licens new technolog if they knew their idea would not be pirat . The deal would encourag foreign invest in local research and develop .Did it deliv ? One studi about the impact of Trip across 60 countri conclud that the deal encourag access to technolog : New drug were unlik to be introduc until they were cover by patent . Patent drug were still more expens than gener , but they becam cheaper in poorer countri .Anoth studi of Trip , howev , conclud that while patent protect did increas research and develop in high-incom countri , it did noth to foster more invest for treatment that combat diseas like malaria that affect the world poor but have no market in the rich world .Tight intellectu properti protect can backfir , stop local from piggyback on foreign invent , discourag indigen innov in less-develop countri .It is often abus . Numer studi have document how pharmaceut compani play the system . When the origin patent on their drug expir , they discourag the entri of cheap gener rival by obtain secondary patent cover slight variat that have littl or no therapeut valu .One studi found hundr of secondari patent layer onto two antiretrovir drug to combat H.I.V. , which delay the entri of gener competit by 12 year .If overli strict patent on drug can be counterproduct , the case against them in other industri is even stronger . In high technolog , for exampl , they often encourag troll-lik behavior and discourag entrepreneur from build on the invent of their predecessor .I do not think we need stronger patent than we have now ,  said Bronwyn H. Hall , an expert on intellectu properti at the Univers of California , Berkeley . There is a larg bodi of evid that suggest patent are not view by firm as key to secur return to innov , except in the pharma sector and a subset of firm in other sectors.The answer to the conundrum about new innov and diffus of exist technolog might hing on what is more import  spread exist clean energi system in the develop world , where energi use is rise sharpli , or invent new one .It depend , unsurprisingli , on where you sit . You do want a pipelin of new technolog ,  said Ambuj D. Sagar , professor of polici studi at the Indian Institut of Technolog Delhi . But diffus is the more substanti point , given the time scale in which we need to make substanti progress.Adam Jaff , a lead author on the third and fifth assess report of the climat chang panel who now direct the research foundat Motu Econom and Public Polici Research in Wellington , New Zealand , disagre . Technolog diffus , he say , is not yet a problem : Today the problem is invent the thing.To be sure , energi system are not the same as drug , which are hard to invent but cheap to make . The most popular technolog be deploy around the world  like solar panel made in China  are hardli cut edg . Financ and know-how are bigger obstacl to the spread of clean energi system in poor countri than intellectu properti right .Still , patent of clean energi technolog ha been increas by 20 percent a year over the last two decad or so , accord to a studi by the Unit Nation Environ Program , the European Patent Offic and the Intern Center for Trade and Sustain Develop . There is a need for improv market condit and encourag licens in the context of effort to enhanc technolog transfer to develop countri ,  the studi conclud .Critic  mostli on the left  have repeatedli recommend weaken or even replac the patent system which , they argu , impos excess cost by rais the price of drug and curtail their access . Propos rang from have the govern buy most drug patent and put them in the public domain , to pay a drug maker base on a formula deriv from how much the drug improv qualiti of life .In the case of clean energi technolog , note a studi by Professor Hall of Berkeley and Christian Helmer of the Center for Econom Perform in London , patent protect may not be the optim instrument for encourag innovation.Nonetheless , patent are probabl here to stay . Still , rich countri will end up one way or anoth pay to spread clean energi technolog among the world poor . Whi not creat a government-support global fund to buy intellectu properti on behalf of poorer nation ? Anoth idea : Financ prize to encourag innov to solv poor people problem .Both invent new clean energi technolog and spread them around the world are behind schedul . We dont have as much time as it took to creat a vaccin against malaria .', 'WASHINGTON  As Puerto Rico ha spiral toward possibl bankruptci , the island sole repres in Congress ha seen hi famili wealth swell , thank in part to Wall Street compani that have sought to capit on the island financi crisi and have hire hi wife to advis them .The dual role  those of a lawmak and a spous who are both involv in the financi affair of their commun  are hardli unusu in Washington , a citi where power coupl are increasingli common and , at time , celebr .But legisl that Pedro R. Pierluisi , a Democrat and the resid commission to Congress from Puerto Rico , ha introduc would benefit at least two of the compani that have hire hi wife , Mara Elena Carrin , for financi advic .Ms. Carrin set up her own Puerto Rico-bas financi advisori firm just 20 day after Mr. Pierluisi , 56 , wa elect to Congress in 2008 , record show . It valu ha climb to more than $ 1 million sinc , and the couple averag net worth ha increas 27-fold sinc that elect .And as Ms. Carrin , 51 , ha done her work for these firm , Mr. Pierluisi offic ha been lobbi by two of her client , Fundament Advisor and Och-Ziff Capit Manag , document provid by the resid commissioner offic show .Separ , a Wall Street hedg fund execut whose firm took part in a $ 3.5 billion bond sale in 2014 for Puerto Rico , ha rais money for Mr. Pierluisi race for governor of Puerto Rico , campaign financ record and email show .The congressman would like to continu the dialogu with the invest commun ,  said an email invit the execut sent in Juli 2014 . It ad that other asset manag and polit personalities would be attend the event . A contribut is suggest , as the congressman is pursu the governorship in 2016.No Hous rule requir Mr. Pierluisi to disclos the name of hi wife client , and he did not . The name of her Wall Street client came to light after The New York Time request them .In separ interview , both Mr. Pierluisi and Ms. Carrin said they kept their profession career separ , and that noth that Mr. Pierluisi had done in Congress had in ani way been intend to benefit hi wife start-up compani , Multicultur Capit , or hi bid for governor .She ha everi right to engag in her profess ,  Mr. Pierluisi said dure an interview at hi Capitol Hill offic . It ha noth to do with what I am do in Congress . The onli link here is that it happen in Puerto Rico.Ms. Carrin  who earn a master degre in busi administr from Columbia Univers and spent more than a decad work for Wall Street invest bank  call question about the potenti conflict of interest unfound .Im a merger and acquisit specialist with 30 year experi in the financi sector ,  she said in a written statement . A a woman and a minor , Im proud to own my own business.Execut at the firm that hire her , includ Fundament Advisor and Och-Ziff , declin to comment on the record .Hous ethic rule place no limit on the work that a spous of a lawmak can do . Two ethic lawyer who examin the matter at the request of The Time said they saw no violat of the rule base on the work that Ms. Carrin ha done .But Meredith McGehe , polici director at the Campaign Legal Center , a campaign financ watchdog group , said that Mr. Pierluisi should have disclos the deal in which hi wife had been involv .Democraci is a confid game  peopl need to have confid that elect offici did not come into power to enrich themselv ,  Ms. McGehe said . The realiti is what they have done here ha creat some smoke , the appear of a conflict , no matter how much the congressman protest that assertion.Ms. Carrin describ Multicultur Capit as an independ consult boutique that help compani interest in invest in Puerto Rico and other Latino market find invest properti worth buy .When she open the busi after her husband elect , it repres a return to the financi world for Ms. Carrin , an expert in emerg market who had work for 15 year at Wall Street firm like Prudenti Financi and Banker Trust befor take a break to pursu a doctor in Puerto Rican histori .From her small offic in San Juan , Ms. Carrin field request from investor look to buy or sell asset , includ hotel and residenti build .Her work in thi area ha coincid with a surg in interest in the island by major Wall Street player , like Apollo Global Manag and Och-Ziff Capit Manag , two New York-bas invest fund . They went to Puerto Rico look for bargain on so-cal distress asset , such as struggl hotel , or to buy some of the island public debt , becaus the govern wa offer unusu high interest rate to pull in much-need money .Och-Ziff ask for Ms. Carrin help in 2012 and 2014 as it look for invest , eventu purchas stake in a hotel and residenti complex on the island . Ms. Carrin firm earn a fee of more than $ 1 million for help set up the deal , accord to particip in the transact . She would not say how much her compani earn in fee .More recent , Ms. Carrin wa hire by Fundament Advisor . Her compani wa not abl to help find a suitabl invest , but her fee wa in the ten of thousand of dollar befor the contract wa termin at the end of last year .In March 2014 , Och-Ziff wa one of at least a dozen hedg fund that purchas larg stake in $ 3.5 billion worth of bond sold by the Puerto Rican govern , with the help of Wall Street firm includ Morgan Stanley .Thi bond offer , the largest sale of junk-rat municip debt in Unit State histori , attract hedg fund instead of the more tradit municip bond investor becaus of the unusu high interest rate that the strap Puerto Rican govern wa will to offer .It is a veri import event for Puerto Rico ,  Hector Negroni , chief invest offic at the hedg fund run by Fundament Advisor , told The Financi Time on the day of the sale . The size of the deal , the audienc they are target and the price they are pay acknowledg the depth of Puerto Rico liquid issues.Within month of the 2014 bond sale , Wall Street execut involv in the transact turn to Mr. Pierluisi offic for help . He had introduc legisl first in Juli 2014 and again in Februari 2015 that would allow the Puerto Rican govern to take advantag of Unit State bankruptci provis avail to the 50 state .For compani like Och-Ziff and Fundament Advisor , that chang in the law would protect their invest in Puerto Rico gener oblig bond if the island won bankruptci protect , while holder of other debt issu by the Puerto Rican govern would be paid back less than promis .The congressman took thi posit for one reason and one reason onli  becaus he believ it is in the best interest of the 3.5 million American citizen that he repres ,  a statement from hi offic said .But in August 2014 , Julio A. Cabral-Corrada , then a broker at Morgan Stanley , which had help issu the $ 3.5 billion in debt , organ a fund-rais event at the Peninsula Hotel on Fifth Avenu in New York , openli hint in the email invit that attende would have access to Mr. Pierluisi to continu the dialogu with the invest community as the negoti in Congress continu .Hous member are not allow to sponsor or particip in ani solicit that offer donor ani special access ,  the rule say .Mr. Cabral-Corrada , in an interview , declin to discuss the event or those who attend .Campaign financ record  for Mr. Pierluisi Hous race and hi account in Puerto Rico to fund hi bid for governor  show contribut around the time of the event from more than a dozen financi industri figur and lobbyist .Mr. Pierluisi , provid with a copi of the fund-rais invit , said he had not previous seen it .Thi is unfortun languag ,  he said .Congress ha not taken ani action on legisl intend to help resolv Puerto Rico financi crisi . A new propos emerg late last month that would no longer guarante that gener oblig bondhold were fulli protect . In the interview , Mr. Pierluisi offer hi tent support for part of thi new Hous propos , which would replac hi own legisl plan , as further proof that he wa not tri to help ani of hi wife former client .Ms. Carrin ad that she had never work for the hedg fund divis of the firm that invest in bond , but instead help their privat equiti wing , which purchas real estat asset like hotel , and that her contract with all of her client includ a provis make clear she doe not lobbi Congress .Some of the firm are so small , though , that execut are involv in run both divis out of the same offic .In the time sinc Mr. Pierluisi ha been in offic , hi wife firm ha grown from have no revenu to be worth more than $ 1 million , hi most recent financi disclosur report , file in 2015 , say .Financi disclosur report Mr. Pierluisi file with the Hous show hi family averag net worth , subtract debt from asset , surg to $ 1 million in 2014 , the most recent report , from $ 36,501 in 2008 , the year he wa elect .Mr. Pierluisi said the chang in hi famili wealth wa entir a result of hi wife earn .In Puerto Rico , some see a familiar pattern . Emilio Pantoja Garca , a professor at the Univers of Puerto Rico who ha written extens on the island debt crisi , said that even if Ms. Carrin work had not benefit from Mr. Pierluisi presenc in Congress , the arrang wa disturb .While everyon els suffer , they are profit from the crisi ,  he said . Unfortun , it is par for the cours when it come to the polit elit in Puerto Rico.', 'BlackRock , Vanguard and other big institut investor own roughli 70 percent of the public stock market , accord to some report . Peopl are start to ask whether thi allow compani  now have the same owner  to compet less and rais price .In Senat testimoni last month , the Justic Department antitrust chief , William J. Baer , said the depart wa investig the potenti antitrust implic of the rise of institut sharehold . More specif , he note that institut sharehold hold big minor stake in mani compani in the same industri .Take , for exampl , the airlin industri . Across all of it fund , BlackRock held 8.3 percent of Unit , 6.6 percent of JetBlu , 4.7 percent of Delta and 4.5 percent of Southwest , as of March 31 , 2013 . Mr. Baer said the Justic Depart wa explor whether such cross-ownership either explicitli or implicitli push compani to compet less .After all , if there is less competit in the airlin industri and higher fare result , it will arguabl benefit BlackRock over all , becaus it hold share in not just one compani but sever in the industri . Less competit may mean higher cost for consum but more profit for the airlin and BlackRock investor .Ask about the Justic Depart investig , a spokesman for BlackRock note to Bloomberg last year that most of the asset manager fund were not activ manag and that while we cant comment on the D.O.J. investig of the airlin industri , we expect fair and ethic competit between the compani we invest in on behalf of our clients.The Justic Department investig wa spur by a draft studi publish by Jos Azar and Isabel Tecu of the consult firm Charl River Associ , along with Martin C. Schmalz of the Univers of Michigan busi school . In that studi , which look at the airlin industri from 2001 to 2013 , the author found that the higher the concentr of cross-ownership by institut sharehold , the less competit and the higher fare that rose . The author estim that airfar rose by 3 to 5 percent on averag becaus of thi cross-sharehold .Let just stop here and note whi thi is interest .These are not the typic antitrust violat where one compani buy a rival and is abl to squeez out competit and rais price . Instead , these institut sharehold posit are minor hold that are pervas throughout the public stock market . If these hold diminish competit and result in higher price , it is an attack on the way share are held . And it also mean that the public is suffer under our capit market arrang .Thi is whi the Justic Department interest is more than academ . It ha the potenti to be an attack on the entir system of mutual fund hold .The studi ha fire up a wave of discuss . The author replic their approach by look at bank with deposit and found similar effect .The paper on airlin ownership is like to spawn a whole field of studi , and the author deserv kudo , but it is import to put it in perspect .The problem is that the Justic Depart will not find anyth in it investig becaus the studi doe not captur how sharehold interact with the compani they invest in , particularli those like BlackRock that are full of passiv index fund .First , dure the time of the airlin studi , the airlin industri wa undergo sweep consolid , with bankruptci and merger galor . At the same time , sharehold were concentr their hold . The paper may just be find a symptom of industri movement , with sharehold flock to more concentr industri but not caus them to be concentr .To address thi question , the author look at the acquisit of Barclay Global Investor by BlackRock in 2009 . Barclay held the iShar busi with more than $ 1.5 trillion in asset under manag ; B.G.I . manag more than $ 1 trillion in asset . The author found that thi acquisit alon rais airlin fare 0.6 percent on all rout as the hold came togeth .The theori is that the hold of the two fund manag combin were so larg it gave them price power . But the author do not report what Barclay and BlackRock held befor or after the acquisit .In respons to an email inquiri , Mr. Azar provid the number they use for the four airlin they studi for thi part of the test . Barclay held 2.2 percent of Delta , 4.6 percent of US Airway , 5.6 percent of AirTran and 4.1 percent of JetBlu . BlackRock held 1.5 percent of Delta , 1.2 percent of US Airway , 1.2 percent of AirTran and 1.3 percent of JetBlu .In the appendix , the author illustr thi phenomenon by look at the rout from Rochest , N.Y. , to West Palm Beach , Fla. , flown by Jet Blue and AirTran .After the acquisit of B.G.I. , BlackRock hold in JetBlu increas to 5.4 percent and it hold in AirTran rose to 6.9 percent , but did that result in less competit on a secondari rout ?It is hard to believ that these smaller chang in ownership at these four airlin among two asset manag actual led fare to rise across the board by such a larg amount . Instead , the author seem to be pick up larg price rise on rout that had smaller carrier like AirTran and JetBlu . If a modest increas in hold caus thi type of reduct in competit , we would expect to see thi happen with other asset manag or acquisit .And that the other problem with thi cross-hold theori . It simpli doe not reflect how sharehold act and think in today environ .Even in an age of activist sharehold , institut sharehold vote onli on director and say on pay advisori issu , as well as other corpor govern initi . How they vote is decid in an offic that is usual separ from the fund manag .Institut investor may engag with manag on their busi , but it is not extens and it is done at the fund level , not global from each asset manag .Instead , fund engag in quasi-pass govern , often herd toward activist investor that do not have these cross-hold . BlackRock , which is known for not challeng manag , just ran it first activist campaign in Hong Kong .It is hard to believ that these sharehold are influenc price at these smaller level without engag with the compani .A counterexplan is that manag seem safe not to compet with all of thi cross-ownership becaus it know it will not be challeng .

Though the invest were valu at onli $ 10 million in total , those posit have sinc been sold .While it would not have been as easi for Yale to sell invest in individu compani becaus it doe not manag most of it money intern , it still ha some separ account that would allow the endow to sell those stock as it did when it sold hold in South Africa and Sudan some year ago .For exampl , the Yale endow wa close to make an invest in an energi compani . That invest had even been approv by the endowment board ,  Mr. Swensen said . But when we sat down with the compani and brought up these issu , they deni it wa a problem , so we did not go forward with the investment.The move came out of grow pressur from student concern about environment issu . Some univers have divest themselv of fossil fuel stock , while other have resist action , argu that they do not want to termin a dialogu with such compani .Mr. Swensen pioneer the use of altern invest in such area as hedg fund .

The project , which featur exact perform of Frank Zappa famous complex music , ha tour the world and won a Grammi .But when Dweezil Zappa take the project on the road thi summer , it will be with a far less catchi name : Dweezil Zappa Play Frank Zappa .It doesnt exactli roll off the tongu ,  he said in an interview , but thi is be done under duress.The name chang is the most visibl sign of a rift that ha grown within one of the rock world most famou famili sinc the death last year of Gail Zappa , the widow of Frank Zappa , who had manag her husband music legaci with a firm hand sinc hi death in 1993 .Thi month , the Zappa Famili Trust , which own the right to Mr. Zappa music , inform Dweezil that he did not have permiss to tour as Zappa Play Zappa  the name is a trademark own by the trust  and that he risk copyright infring damag of $ 150,000 each time he play a song without proper permiss .Mi last name is Zappa ; my father wa Frank Zappa ,  Dweezil said . But I am not allow to use the name on it own . Im not allow to use a pictur of him . Im not allow to use my own connect with him without some sort of deal to be struck.Busi disput are familiar territori among celebr sibl , and member of group like the Door and Creedenc Clearwat Reviv have also fought over the use of a valuabl band name . As the 1960 rock gener age , these type of disput may becom more common , music lawyer say .After Gail Zappa death , control of the trust pass to two of the four Zappa children : Ahmet , a son , who control the day-to-day oper of the busi , and Diva , a daughter . Dweezil and hi sister Moon are not truste , but all four children are beneficiari , and tension have flare between the two side over the Zappa Play Zappa tour and a recent Kickstart campaign for a documentari film .Dweezil and Ahmet , who were onc so close that they record two album togeth and made regular appear on late-night TV , now seem to commun primarili through lawyer , with disput over trademark and music licens .In addit to chang the name of hi tribut project , Dweezil Zappa said that he would not carri ani of the trust offici merchandis or use ani imag of hi father  whose like is also control by the trust  in promot the tour . He will , howev , play the same song from hi father catalog that he alway ha .In an interview , Ahmet Zappa said he wa not feud with hi brother but rather maintain the integr of the estat and preserv Zappa Play Zappa as a famili enterpris , avail to ani of the four children .I am not stand in the way of Dweezil play the music ,  Ahmet said . He would just have to be in accord with the famili trust.Dweezil Zappa said that chang the name of hi tour would emancipate him from deal with the famili trust . Hi complaint in some way resembl those of a disgruntl artist war with a record compani : lack of commun , inexplic delay , disagr over payment from merchandis sale . The disput also spill over into the divis of estat properti , like a set of guitar that Dweezil said were given to him by hi father but , he say , were repossessed by hi mother .But the most contenti part of the disput is over the minutia of music licens , an area in which the Zappa estat ha long taken controversi stanc . The famili trust argu that for a show consist larg of Frank Zappa music , perform can not reli on the standard performing-right licens that music venu typic get from agenc like Ascap or BMI , but instead need special permiss from the estat for grand right ,  a term that usual appli to theatric present .Gail Zappa and Ascap pursu a number of band under thi theori , with mix success . Project/Object , a well-known Zappa tribut group , had some of it show cancel by club that had receiv legal letter , but Andr Cholmondeley , a member of the band , said that the group wa advis by a lawyer that it did not need a special licens , and so ha never gotten one . We simpli adher to U.S.A. law ,  Mr. Cholmondeley said in an email .What make a piec of music dramat is not clearli state in copyright law , but Conrad M. Rippi , a lawyer who ha work in both theater and music , said that it gener need to meet sever criteria .I it perform in a place where you gener would perform a theatric work ? Are peopl wear costum ? Doe it advanc a narr stori line ?  Mr. Rippi said . The closer you get to answer those question Ye ,  the more it look like that a grand right . A tribut band play a Frank Zappa song in a club meet none of those tests.Dweezil Zappa said that while hi mother charg him an exorbit fee to use the name Zappa Play Zappa , he ha never paid for a grand right licens .For the Zappa , the disput seem to have divid a once-tight-knit famili , whose children were veri much a part of their father music career . Moon , the eldest child , sang as a teenag on Frank Zappa onli Top 40 singl , Valley Girl ,  in 1982 .Ahmet said he wa perplex by the claim by hi brother , whom he prais as a suprem talent guitarist and the funniest dude. He ad : Mayb he griev . For all of us it been superemotional. ( Dweezil answer : There is obviou deceit in my brother respons . Hi action speak louder than words. )The Dweezil Zappa Play Frank Zappa tour will begin in Juli , with what Dweezil said would be a crew of highli skill musicians perform hi father music faith .Dweezil said he wa eager to be free of the demand of the estat , but he wa concern that the name chang might confus fan or erod the good will he ha built up with hi audienc over a decad of Zappa Play Zappa show .I just hope peopl will understand ,  he said , that the onli thing Im chang is the name.', 'The note defens lawyer Alan M.

Some state are take step that could lead to thi outcom , but not on a scale or at a pace that would end what ha been call mass incarcer .So can Congress and the feder govern come up with new law and polici that might stop state and counti from imprison so mani peopl ?Presidenti candid have stake out some ambitious-sound polici on prison . Mrs. Clinton want to cut mandatori minimum sentenc for nonviol drug offens and reduc the mandatori penalti for a second or third violent offens . Mr. Sander propos elimin mandatori minimum and ha call for a ban on privat prison .The Republican have said less . Ted Cruz ha call for an overhaul of mandatori minimum sentenc but ha also spoken out against a bill in the Senat that seek to do that . John Kasich , governor of Ohio , in 2011 sign legisl allow for some loosen of sentenc in the state . Donald Trump posit is unclear .An overhaul in sentenc is one of the few polici area with bipartisan cooper in Congress . The Senat may pass a bill to reduc mandatori minimum sentenc ( though it progress is now face challeng ) .But the candid havent realli address how the feder govern could influenc state behavior . The Senat bill , for instanc , focus on feder prison ; the presidenti candid have not suggest specif measur to influenc the state . Still , the debat over incarcer may yet turn to the question of how to lean on the state .A clash last week between Bill Clinton and Black Live Matter protest focus on the 1994 feder Violent Crime Control and Law Enforc Act , as it known , which Mr. Clinton push for and sign . Some law-and-ord specialist , argu that the law creat incent prompt state to send more peopl to prison , say that pass a new feder law that doe the opposit could help reduc state prison number .The Brennan Center for Justice Revers Mass Incarcer Act , written by Lauren-Brook Eisen and Inimai Chettiar of the center , would be such a law . The propos from the center entic the state with a possibl $ 20 billion of feder grant over 10 year to cut prison popul by at least 7 percent over three year . The analyst say that such an approach ha a good chanc of work right now becaus mani state , in part recogn that some sentenc ha been overli strict , have alreadi start to take step to cut prison popul .But other criminologist , skeptic that the 1994 law had such a big effect , are unconvinc that ani new feder law would have much sway . My colleagu Erik Eckholm detail the argument of those who question whether the 1994 bill play a decis part in drive state imprison higher . ( Their main argument is that the state were alreadi send far more peopl to prison befor the passag of the bill . )There are other object to someth like the Brennan propos . It $ 20 billion in grant work out to $ 2 billion a year , which some critic call too small to matter , given that state and counti spend some $ 200 billion a year on crimin justic and about $ 70 billion on correct . Ms. Chettiar of the Brennan Center note that the feder govern ha frequent use dollar to prod state polici .And there are polit calcul . John Pfaff , a law professor at Fordham Univers , contend that it make littl sens to spend the limit polit capit that might exist to overhaul crimin justic on feder legisl that , in hi view , is unlik to significantli chang states behavior . In hi research , Mr. Pfaff ha shown how state and counti prosecutor have driven prison popul higher by file more case than they use to . Ani measur to reduc state prison popul , accord to Mr. Pfaff , need to focu on prosecutor and the prosecut . Such measur might includ make it harder for counti law enforc offici to send peopl to state prison that the counti do not pay for .Help defend could also reduc the number of peopl in state prison , which wa 1.35 million in 2014 . One reason that prosecutor send more peopl to prison might be that mani defend dont get compet legal help from public defend , who have overwhelm caseload . Mr. Pfaff propos that the feder govern spend $ 4 billion a year on public defend in the state and counti system , which he say might be a shield against overzeal prosecutor .But law enforc data doe not clarifi for criminologist which type of case prosecutor have emphas . Did the increas in the prison popul come from a more aggress pursuit of violent offens , or nonviol one ? Without know thi , it hard to say whether a measur that , say , seek to press district attorney to reduc imprison and sentenc for nonviol offens would have much effect on the overal prison popul .Such question may not be answer soon . But the debat over the larg prison popul ha taken on such a promin in thi presidenti campaign that it might not be long befor the candid start ask more detail question about it caus  and what can be done to address them .', 'About two year ago , I wa speak with an execut at MetLif who float the idea that the compani should sue the govern to overturn it design as a firm that wa too big to fail . The compani believ that it wa be unfairli label , and that the regul that came with the design were hinder it busi .My initi reaction , I distinctli rememb , wa to say : That a terribl riski idea . The govern alway wins.Boy wa I wrong .As we all know , MetLif won it case against the govern last week , and it posit ha been vindic , at least until the decis is appeal .A judg determin that the government process for design MetLif a system import institut wa not just fatal flaw ,  but seemingli purpos so . Everi possibl effect of MetLife immin insolv wa summarili deem grave enough to damag the economi ,  Judg Rosemari M. Collyer wrote in her opinion .Not surprisingli , Jacob J. Lew , the Treasuri secretari , took great umbrag . In overturn the conclus of experienc financi regul , the court impos new requir that Congress never enact , and contradict key polici lesson from the financi crisi ,  he said .I have no idea if MetLif is too big to fail . Iv read hundr of page of legal brief from both side , and talk to compani and govern offici and outsid expert , and Im still not sure . Iv tri to make sens of it , but it is a highli complic puzzl and to make such a determin with ani degre of certainti requir mathemat project how money will flow between hundr of institut around the globe .Which rais thi question : How can ani judg with anyth short of a doctor in statist and econom model be task with effect overse the decis of a group like the Financi Stabil Oversight Council , which includ the leader of the Treasuri , the Feder Reserv , the Secur and Exchang Commiss , the Feder Deposit Insur Corpor , and the list goe on .Judg Collyer smartli chose not to comment on whether MetLif wa actual too big to fail , and she left open the possibl that the compani could someday merit that design . In her opinion , she said more narrowli that the process of determin that statu in the case of MetLif wa problemat .The judg ha a long histori as a thought lawyer and jurist . She also a member of the Unit State Foreign Intellig Surveil Court and onc work as the gener counsel of the Nation Labor Relat Board . In other word , she a legal rock star .But her job in the case wa , in effect , to approv or reject the approach the oversight council took in it analysi .Judg , of cours , are often ask to weigh in on complic matter that are beyond their area of expertis . The judg in the case of the F.B.I. effort to unlock an Appl phone wa not an engin or a comput scientist . And our legal system regularli ask juror with no background in a particular subject to decid difficult case .But in certain instanc , like the case involv MetLif and the oversight council , should there be a special court , perhap with an area of expertis ?Mani of the lawyer I spoke with scof at the idea of a special tribun to deal with issu relat to the oversight council , say that it is a judge job to determin whether govern agenc provid appropri regul .Still , Joshua D. Wright , a former commission of the Feder Trade Commiss , co-wrot a 2011 studi that determin in antitrust case , a judge expertis had a signific impact on the valid of the rule . Decis of judg train in basic econom are significantli less like to be appeal than are decis by their untrain counterpart ,  the studi say . Our analysi support the hypothesi that some antitrust case are too complic for generalist judges.Now , with the rule by Judg Collyer in the MetLif case , mani analyst are expect that other compani , includ potenti Gener Electr and Prudenti , will sue to have their design lift too . That put the decis not to a committe of ostens qualifi expert , but to a panel of judg with limit experi .Judg Collyer decis may well be entir valid , but at least in certain place she appear off base . For exampl , she said the govern never project what the loss would be , which financi institut would have to activ manag their balanc sheet or how the market would destabil as a result.Well , the govern appear to have done much of that in it report , but youd need a pretti sophist understand of financ to understand exactli how their number were calcul .Judg Collyer either decid to ignor those number or decid they were chosen arbitrarili .The conundrum in the case of the oversight council is that determin which compani pose a system risk cant be done with a straight formula . The natur of financi crise mean that , as a regul , your play against a 100-year storm that you cant fulli forese .That not to say the govern didnt mess up in it process of design MetLif . It now seem as if the govern , in some instanc , didnt even follow it own guidelin . It may get anoth shot , though , with the chanc to go back and remak it case that MetLif should be design too big to fail .For now , we are left with a rule that ha damag the government abil to regul an institut that at least some pretti smart peopl who studi these thing thought requir an extra level of scrutini .

The three parri question about the busi in a cramp confer room with door and shutter paint in DriveU compani color  shamrock green .What will it take for someon to come in and replic thi ?  ask Srikrishna Ramamoorthi , a partner for Unitu Seed , a ventur capit fund start out of Seattl that invest in Indian compani . Couldnt the Ola guy come in and do thi ? Essenti they could ,  said Ashok Shastri , 25 , a co-found of DriveU , who with hi long short and spiki hair look as if he would be more at home in Palo Alto , Calif. , than Bangalor . But it would be take away from their focus. The model for Uber and Ola , he said , are built on the premis that custom do not use their own car .The ventur capitalist persist . If Uber and Ola were to enter the market , What would your respons be ?  he ask .Amulmeet Chadha , anoth founder of DriveU , said , It about be a cockroach and surviving.That kind of tenac is what attract Mr. Ramamoorthi to the DriveU team . And it illustr that until now the Indian start-up market ha been more about great execut than cutting-edg technolog .In Silicon Valley , the gener invest thesi for a technolog investor tend to be around how strong a company underli technolog is and how defens it will be over time ,  Will Pool , Unitu Seed co-found , explain later . Veri rare doe a ventur capit investor invest in an oper busi that doe not have an intellectu properti moat.In emerg market like India , howev , you can build veri larg and profit busi on an oper basi without have a fundament or long-term technolog advantag becaus you are build in greenfield area with littl or no competit ,  he said .Last year wa a headi one for ventur invest in India ; invest rose 61 percent , to $ 1.9 billion , from $ 1.2 billion in 2014 , accord to Ventur Intellig , a Chennai-bas compani that track Indian ventur activ . About $ 95 million of the total repres invest and co-invest in the social impact space by tradit V.C. and specialist firm like Unitu Seed .Most of the capit flow into India come from offshoot of American ventur firm . Thi ha led to a gener of homegrown version of Unit State compani like Flipkart , the Amazon of India , get fund .But that may be chang . Speak in Bangalor last summer , Chamath Palihapitiya , the founder of the Palo Alto-bas ventur fund now known as Social Capit , said he would like to put a billion dollar to work in the next 10 year here , plu or minus.Yet he told the crowd of entrepreneur that the kind of start-up he would be invest in were compani that were so uniqu and unexplain in a Harvard Busi case to a bunch of Americans.For it part , Unitu Seed ha found that the plethora of have-not in India mean there are lucr opportun to put money into Indian compani that offer a much-need servic at a low price point .Among ventur capit investor in India , Unitu Seed , with $ 23 million in capit , is a speck . It is eclips by far larger player like Sequoia Capit , SAIF Partner , Accel Partner , SoftBank of Japan , Alibaba of China and Lee Fixel of the invest firm Tiger Global .But what Unitu Seed lack in firepow , it make up for in star power .It investor includ Bill Gate ; the billionair investor Vinod Khosla ; the ex-Infosi manag Mohanda Pai ; and Diego Piacentini , a top Amazon execut . The drug maker Pfizer and the Michael & Susan Dell Foundat are also investor in Unitu Seed .Broadli speak , Unitu Seed portfolio compani fall into two categori . One is compos of compani that offer afford product and servic in area like health care , educ and financi servic to India mass , give them access to servic that are otherwis too costli or simpli unavail .Exampl in thi categori are invest in UE LifeSci , which offer breast scan for a coupl of dollar through it portabl iBreastExam devic ; Welcar Health System , which deliv low-cost eye screen ; and Hippocampu Learn Center , which provid afford kindergarten and after-school facil .A second categori of compani includ those that offer labor as a servic ,  thu move labor from chaotic , more disorgan sector to more formal employ , and increas financi and other benefit to low-incom worker .DriveU fit into that categori , give it best full-tim chauffeur health insur , someth that is nearli unheard-of in India .In assess start-up like DriveU , Unitu Seed first ask if the manag team ha what it take to persever in the world most competit market ,  Mr. Pool said .If you have a great idea , you have to be abl to run realli hard and fast ,  he ad , in order to compet with someon who is as good at the same thing .The approach could pay off soon .The fund ha close one transact for a partial exit  a veri profit exit for us  and we have anoth transact which is in the final negoti for a complet exit ,  said Mr. Pool , who declin to name the compani .For month , Unitu Seed invest team had been wrestl with the threat that Uber and Ola present to DriveU . Ultim , it wa someth Mr. Shastry father Ramprasad , who goe by Rahm , said that convinc Unitu Seed Mr. Pool and the team that the threat wa manag .Rahm Shastri , who is the company chief execut , explain that Uber and Ola driver have high fix cost ( their car ) and the possibl of earn a higher hourli wage . If Ola and Uber offer on-demand chauffeur , the driver would still have high fix cost but would then earn a lower wage . DriveU chauffeur earn less than Ola and Uber driver .DriveU wa go to oper in a place that is pain for it competit to copi it busi model ,  Mr. Pool said . That is the fundament argument of whi Ola and Uber are not go to do thi right away.When DriveU start in Juli 2015 , it met with some of the bigger ventur capit firm like Sequoia and Matrix Partner .Rahm Shastri had becom well known after sell a compani he had invest in , TaxiForSur , to Olacab for about $ 200 million last year .He wa also an experienc oper . Until recent , he work in Silicon Valley , rotat in and out of a success of technolog compani as their chief execut . Hi specialti wa start-up and turn around compani . ( Most entrepreneur that ventur fund encount in India are start compani for the first time . )In 2015 , after more than three decad in America , Mr. Shastri and hi wife , Glenda , a Midwestern , move to India at the prod of Ashok , who had an idea for a start-up : Park on Demand .One path to fast growth is to drop price , but Rahm Shastri is adam about keep the cost of the ride at 99 rupe an hour ( less than $ 1.50 ) , rather than drop it to 49 rupe , which wa suggest by potenti investor . The extra 10,000 rupe a month our driver earn he can send hi daughter to a better school ,  he said , defend hi decis .Last month , Unitu Seed announc that it wa invest in DriveU .Though it did not disclos the amount , peopl with knowledg of the matter say DriveU ha receiv $ 1 million from Unitu Seed and other Silicon Valley angel investor .', 'Two union repres roughli 36,000 Verizon worker in the eastern Unit State have set a strike deadlin of Wednesday morn , say they have made littl progress with manag in the more than eight month sinc their most recent contract expir . The announc set up what would be one of the largest strike in recent year .The union , which repres custom servic worker , instal , repairmen and other technician for the company so-cal wirelin network , said on Monday that they had indic they would meet Verizon more than halfway on it top prioriti , control health care cost . But they said Verizon had made few or no concess on their biggest concern : protect well-pay job and expand the rank of the worker who have them .Our committe work veri hard to address all of the concern they rais about limit health care cost for the compani , and wev been clear about our willing to do so ,  said Bob Master , assist to the vice presid of District 1 at the Commun Worker of America , one of the union in the contract talk . The reason wer go on strike is that they fail to reciproc on the issu that matter to us.Verizon offici maintain that the chang competit and technolog landscap requir a continu updat of the rule govern it work forc . Wer move to a digit world ,  said Marc Reed , Verizon chief administr offic . There are mani thing that were agre to that made sens back in the Ma Bell era that are no longer tenable.Verizon say that as more and more American give up landlin , it is onli natur that phone servic provid like Verizon will requir fewer worker to oper and maintain them .In a releas , Verizon said that it wirelin busi  it tradit landlin phone servic , as well as video and Internet offer to home and busi , but not it wireless oper  gener about 29 percent of it revenu in 2015 but less than 7 percent of it oper incom , suggest that thi busi wa not especi profit . The compani also said that the employe cover by the contract current be negoti  over 99 percent of them in the wirelin busi  receiv an averag of $ 130,000 a year in wage and benefit .Mr. Reed and anoth Verizon offici , Robert Mudg , the presid of Verizon wirelin network oper , express confid that custom would experi no servic disrupt in the event of a strike . They said the compani had begun train other personnel from among it total work forc of more than 175,000 to perform the duti of the union worker .Most often , the duti will be perform by employe in the manag rank who supervis the worker go on strike . Mr. Mudg said the replac worker would also includ some inform technolog profession , financ personnel and engin . If the strike last beyond a few day or week , he said , it might be necessari to explor outsid contract arrang .A strike in 2011 last two week befor the two side agre to a new contract .The fate of Verizon call center highlight some of the crucial divid between manag and the union . Verizon say that some of it call center hous onli a hand of employe , and that it want to be abl to move the worker to other site in the same broad geograph area . But the current contract prevent reloc exceed 35 mile .Those rule may have made sens 40 year ago ,  Mr. Reed said . Now they dont.The union say that thi ignor the underli issu : One reason the volum of employe at certain call center ha fallen , Mr. Master said , is that the compani outsourc some of thi work to contract worker in other countri like the Philippin and Mexico and to other part of the Unit State . Verizon want to increas the percentag of customer-servic call that can be rout to worker outsid the region where the call origin .One possibl way for the compani to expand it pool of well-paid job at a time when it tradit copper-lin busi is onli margin profit and shrink would be to expand it fiber-opt network , known as Fio , which can packag togeth televis , Internet and telephon servic . But Verizon appear to have sour on a large-scal expans of it Fio network .We repres the peopl who instal Fio , it the futur of the business said Mr. Master . But they wont build Fio in Buffalo , in Syracus , in Albany.Ian Olgeirson , an industri analyst with SNL Kagan , said Verizon had fulfil is initi plan of lay fiber that could serv as mani as 18 million home , but hadnt progress much beyond that plan .I think there wa alway an assumpt they would go one step further and address more copper-bas household that were not in that initi plan , and it doesnt seem like there much appetit for that ,  said Mr. Olgeirson . He cite as one caus the competit from stream video onlin rather than pay for a bundl packag that includ televis .For hi part , Mr. Mudg said : We continu to invest in Fio . Wer put as much invest in Fio today as we did in the previou five years.Other issu at stake includ how long a worker can be ask to temporarili work outsid of hi or her normal area  the compani propos up to two month , which the union say is too long  and what the union say are Verizon refus to negoti better wage or benefit for about 100 Verizon Wireless retail worker , who union in 2014', 'Puerto Rico propos a new plan on Monday to restructur it debt , offer some creditor better term than an earlier plan but fall well short of win broad support .The plan wa announc as member of Congress in Washington struggl with a moment decis : whether and how to give Puerto Rico extraordinari power to wipe out debt . Conserv Republican have resist thi idea , but major default are loom . Last week lawmak in Puerto Rico step up pressur on Congress to act quickli by suddenli author the island governor to halt payment on $ 72 billion in debt .If the threat of a debt payment moratorium wa Puerto Rico stick , the restructur offer on Monday appear to be a carrot . Puerto Rico said it had found a way to make debt payment of $ 1.85 billion a year , compar with the $ 1.7 billion a year it had offer befor .The commonwealth is in crisi , and the fact is that we will onli be abl to address these issu by work togeth ,  Victor A. Suarez , Puerto Rico secretari of state , said in a statement . Our commit to thi is underscor by our willing to listen to our differ creditor and work to meet their needs.The new restructur plan cover $ 49.3 billion of Puerto Rico total debt , most of which is in the form of municip bond . It call for creditor to accept $ 32.6 billion to $ 37.4 billion up front by exchang exist bond for two new class of bond . The offer is up from a previou offer of $ 26.5 billion .Puerto Rico Govern Develop Bank , a crucial part of the local economi , risk default on $ 422 million in debt payment due May 1 , and the island face $ 2 billion in payment on debt in Juli . Lawmak both in San Juan and Washington have been work to prevent a disorderli collaps of the island financ . Congress is work on a revis propos to help Puerto Rico restructur under the supervis of a feder oversight panel .The Treasuri secretari , Jacob J. Lew , speak at the Council on Foreign Relat on Monday , said , There are still some open issues.There are a lot of detail , but when you get down to the bottom line the question to us is : Doe that restructur author work ? It ha to work or it not go to be accept ,  he said . It cant be someth that you put a label on but in the marketplac it doesnt work. He did not comment on Puerto Rico new propos .Puerto Rico began present it first restructur propos to creditor in Januari . A number of them said they consid it unaccept ; some have tri with littl success to interest Puerto Rico in counteroff .Particular resist ha come from creditor who hold bond back by Puerto Rico most ironclad pledg . Gener oblig bond , for exampl , are specif guarante by the island constitut , and some holder argu that anyth less than full , time repay would be unconstitut .Puerto Rico ha taken the posit that all type of creditor must sacrific , howev . The new offer announc on Monday reflect that posit . Gener oblig bond held by investor who do not live on the island would get a recoveri rate of 74 percent under the new propos . Holder of sales-tax-back bond would get 57 percent ; and holder of bond issu by the Govern Develop Bank would get just 36 percent .Puerto Rico financi crisi , and the solut sought by Washington , could reverber throughout municip financ . A potenti stick point is that Puerto Rico other long-term commit , such as the pension of retir govern worker , would not be reduc under the new restructur plan . Pension do not current have top legal prioriti in the order of creditor seek payment , and some lawmak think that switch around credit prioriti for Puerto Rico would send a shock through the capit market , make it harder for other state and citi to borrow .The new propos call for current bondhold to trade in their hold for two new type of bond . Bondhold would get more or less of each type , depend on the prioriti of the bond they now hold . Those with the highest-prior bond would get more of the first type , which offer less monetari valu but greater certainti of repay .The first type would be a base bond with a total face valu rang from $ 32.6 billion to $ 37.4 billion , depend on whether bondhold in Puerto Rico opt in or took advantag of the special offer avail to them alon .The new base bond would start out pay 1.1 percent interest for the come fiscal year . ( Under Puerto Rico previou offer , interest payment would not have start until a year later . ) The interest rate would then rise gradual to 5 percent in 2021 , the same year princip repay would start .Bondhold live in Puerto Rico would , howev , have the chanc to recov more of their initi invest if they were will to wait . Instead of trade in their hold for the regular base bond , they could opt for local holder base bond ,  which would have a valu equal to the face amount of the bond be hand over . The local holder base bond would pay a fix , 2 percent rate of interest over a longer period of time .A summari of the propos note that Puerto Rico wa seek to provid relief to those Puerto Rican who live day-to-day off their interest payment ,  and the govern wa also look at other way of help them .For investor not live in Puerto Rico , there would be onli a chanc of get a full recoveri . In addit to their base bond , they would get a second type , call capit appreci bond ,  which would not offer ani cash payment until after the base bond had been fulli repaid and it wa clear how much of a loss each type of bondhold had suffer .At that point , thi second type of bond would start pay investor enough to make up for their loss over a long time .', 'Denni Paustenbach , a top consult to compani face lawsuit over product or environment practic , ha long been eager to put a stop to accus that hi compani , ChemRisk , slant scientif find to suit it client .The company most recent target wa two activist who wrote an articl rais question about it for The Huffington Post .

A report issu by the nonprofit organ Global Wit , featur on the 60 Minutes news program in Januari , includ undercov video of lawyer in New York who appear quit eager to advis the mysteri repres of an African minist about how to move fund into the Unit State to buy asset while keep hi ownership anonym .Rather than seek to keep client from violat the law , it appear that some lawyer are will to go right up to the line of legal in their represent . By keep themselv ignor about what may be go on , these lawyer have been abl to maintain the facad that they are not involv in potenti illeg activ , even though they are often the prime enabl of misconduct .Ha the legal profess lost it moral compass ?The answer is that the ethic rule govern lawyer do not put much of a barrier in the way of help client engag in transact that would appear question but do not violat ani specif law , so it is not clear whether lawyer push to the edg of the law are act improperli .Model Rule of Profession Conduct 1.2 ( d ) , issu by the American Bar Associ , say that a lawyer should not counsel a client to engag , or assist a client in conduct that the lawyer know is crimin or fraudulent.Note how the rule is premis on the lawyer knowledg , and mani lawyer are expert at keep themselv ignor about exactli what is take place to maintain plausibl deniabl . Moreov , that same rule say that a lawyer may discuss the legal consequ of ani propos cours of conduct ,  so explor the limit of the law can be permiss .Ramn Fonseca , one of the founder of the Panamanian firm Mossack Fonseca , the sourc of the leak Panama Paper , told The New York Time that the lawyer did noth wrong in help their client set up shell compani .We are like a car factori who sell it car to a dealer ( a lawyer for exampl ) , and he sell it to a ladi that hit someon . The factori is not respons for what is done with the car ,  he wrote .Lawyer in the Unit State are not requir to compli with anti-money launder complianc procedur impos on financi institut that requir gather inform about the ident of account owner and the sourc of fund or asset . By avoid the duti to inquir about their client , lawyer can turn a blind eye by focus onli on what the client want without ask the harder question about what led to seek legal advic .That may be the root of the issu of how lawyer enabl their client to engag in question transact while avoid ani direct involv , which allow them to claim to have done noth improp .If legal advic is view mere as a tool , just like a car , with no requir to inquir ani more deepli about the client background and intent , then it is easi to see how lawyer becom part of the problem . The lawyer who were caught on video by Global Wit can assert they were simpli discuss option with a potenti client , with no oblig to question too deepli becaus thi wa onli a preliminari discuss that might not advanc ani further .Lawyer often defend themselv by assert that their onli oblig is to repres their client , with no greater public oblig . As long as they do not know the client will engag in crimin or fraudul conduct , then advanc the client interest by ostens legal mean is not onli permiss , but a posit social good , even if their servic might be misus .The way to chang thi approach is to focu on the tool that lawyer have avail by make it harder for client to use their servic to engag in misconduct . The Panama Paper detail the use of shell compani to hide asset , someth The Time also describ extens in it seri Tower of Secrecy articl about how the Manhattan condominium market is rife with anonym owner shield their ident behind corpor facad .The Incorpor Transpar and Law Enforc Assist Act , which ha been introduc in the Hous and Senat , would requir state to gather the name of those who control corpor and limit liabil compani , the vehicl use to hide the true owner of asset . These propos have not gain ani traction yet in Congress , with the American Bar Associ oppos earlier bill on the subject . The Panama Paper may give a push to the effort to requir that ownership of corpor entiti be avail to law enforc , even if it is not publicli disclos .The Treasuri Depart is close to issu a rule that would requir bank to determin the ident of ani individu owner of 25 percent or more of a corpor or L.L.C . that open an account , along with individu who exercis control over them . Lawyer will have to provid that inform to bank if their client are go to have an account , which may push lawyer to gather more inform .Neither of these propos is guarante to reveal who is use legal entiti to maintain anonym . One way around the disclosur requir would be to set up separ entiti so that onli one person ha control of the bank account or own the entity share , thu limit whose ident must be reveal .Lawyer could also be subject to the same anti-money launder rule as bank , although that is sure to provok fierc opposit from the legal profess . The attorney-cli privileg is usual invok as the reason to exclud lawyer from have to compli with the know your customer rule that would requir disclos the ident of their client .Whether such disclosur would actual threaten the relationship between a lawyer and client is an open question . The power of the profess to point to the need for client secreci ha success thwart most effort to compel lawyer to reveal inform .It is no surpris that lawyer are at the center of the debat about how to deal with the use of shell compani and secret account to hide asset becaus lawyer are frequent involv in structur the entiti . Despit the elev rhetor about the role of lawyer in societi , the legal ethic rule do littl to restrict how lawyer can repres client who flirt with the edg of the law .Limit the tool for help client engag in misconduct would make it harder for lawyer to claim they are onli serv the wish of those client .', 'State and feder offici said on Monday that Goldman Sach would pay $ 5.1 billion to settl accus of wrongdo befor the financi crisi .But that is just on paper . Buri in the fine print are provis that allow Goldman to pay hundr of million of dollar less  perhap as much as $ 1 billion less  than that headlin figur . And that is befor the tax benefit of the deal are includ .The bank will be abl to reduc it bill substanti through a combin of govern incent and tax credit . For exampl , the settlement call for Goldman to spend $ 240 million on afford hous . But a chart attach to the settlement explain that the bank will have to pay at most onli 30 percent of that money to fulfil the deal . That is becaus it will receiv a particularli larg credit for each dollar it spend on afford hous .Goldman is the last of the major American bank to settl with the govern . Past deal with other bank also contain some of these concess , but Goldman appear to have negoti an even sweeter deal on certain point . For all the bank , the credit suggest that the amount that the bank will have to actual spend on consum relief will be much lower than the number announc in the news releas .They appear to have grossli inflat the settlement amount for P.R . purpos to mislead the public , while in the fine print , enabl Goldman Sach to pay 50 to 75 percent less ,  said Denni Kelleh , the founder of the advocaci organ Better Market , refer to the govern announc . The problem all along , with all of these settlement  and thi one highlight it even more  is that they are care craft more to conceal than reveal to the American public what realli happen here  and what the so-cal penalti is.A Justic Depart offici with direct knowledg of the negoti , who spoke on the condit that hi name not be disclos , said that the bank were given extra credit for activ that the govern want to encourag , like fund develop of low-incom hous or provid relief to area hit by natur disast . But he also said that the final term were a result of a back and forth between the bank and govern offici .Goldman is the last of the big American bank to reach a settlement with the nation work group that wa set up in 2012 to investig how Wall Street exacerb the mortgag bubbl and ensu financi crisi . The group includ sever feder regul and state attorney gener .The final bill for Goldman is less than the settlement of mortgag giant like JPMorgan , which the govern said wa pay $ 13.3 billion , but more than the $ 3.2 billion settlement the govern secur with Goldman closest competitor , Morgan Stanley .The special credit negoti by the bank are laid out in annex connect to each settlement .JPMorgan Chase , for instanc , earn a $ 1.15 credit toward it settlement requir for each dollar of loan forgiv it offer within the first year , accord to the settlement it complet in 2013 . Goldman , in contrast , is get $ 1.50 of credit for each dollar of loan forgiv within the first six month after the settlement  an addit incent that JPMorgan did not receiv . JPMorgan also did not get the 70 percent discount on money go to afford hous .When ask about these differ , the Justic Depart offici said that the wrongdo that the bank were accus of wa differ and , as a result , the negoti took differ cours .Like other bank , Goldman bought loan issu by subprim mortgag specialist like Countrywid Financi . Goldman then packag these loan into bond that were abl to get the highest rate from credit rate agenc . The loan were sold to investor , who sustain loss when the loan went sour .Over the cours of 2006 , Goldman employe took note of the decreas qualiti of loan that it wa buy , accord to a statement of fact releas along with the settlement . When an outsid analyst wrote a posit report about Countrywide stock in April 2006 , the head of due dilig at Goldman wrote in an email : If they onli knew.Despit the worri sign , Goldman did not alert investor who were buy the bond it wa packag , offici said on Monday .Thi resolut hold Goldman Sach account for it seriou misconduct in fals assur investor that secur it sold were back by sound mortgag , when it knew that they were full of mortgag that were like to fail ,  Stuart F. Deleri , the act associ attorney gener , said in a statement . The bank agre to a statement of fact outlin it wrongdo .Goldman said in a statement on Monday : We are pleas to put these legaci matter behind us . Sinc the financi crisi , we have taken signific step to strengthen our cultur , reinforc our commit to our client and ensur our govern process are robust.Nearli half of Goldman settlement  $ 2.4 billion  will be paid in a civil penalti . Most of the rest will go to provid relief to consum who were hurt by the financi crisi .Goldman will benefit from consider concess when it come to consum relief .On the broadest level , ani money that Goldman spend on consum relief will be deduct from it corpor tax bill . If Goldman spend $ 2.5 billion on consum relief , and pay the maximum Unit State corpor tax rate of 35 percent , it could , in theori , reap $ 875 million in tax save .But Goldman could easili pay less than $ 2.5 billion in consum relief becaus of the section of the settlement that give it extra credit for certain type of activ .For everi $ 1 that the bank spend on afford hous develop , the bank will get a $ 3.25 credit toward the $ 240 million , with the possibl of get 15 percent more credit if it pay earli .Eric T. Schneiderman , the New York attorney gener , announc that Goldman would pay $ 280 million for commun reinvest and neighborhood stabil in New York . But an annex to the agreement with New York explain that Goldman will get $ 2 of credit for everi dollar it spend in thi area , mean that it will ultim have to pay onli $ 140 million to meet the term of the deal .In sum , the detail in the variou annex suggest that Goldman could end up pay over $ 1 billion less than the $ 5 billion than wa announc on Monday .In Januari , Goldman said that it put asid $ 3.4 billion in 2015 to cover the cost of what would becom it $ 5 billion settlement .', 'After five month of pressur , three merger offer and one reject from regul , Canadian Pacif Railway said on Monday that it had abandon effort to combin with it American railroad counterpart Norfolk Southern .Canadian Pacif withdrew a resolut for Norfolk Southern sharehold to vote on negoti between the two compani , accord to a statement by Canadian Pacif .We have long recogn that consolid is necessari for the North American rail industri to meet the demand of a grow economi ,  Canadian Pacific chief execut , E.

So might the eventu impact of big oil companies postpon hundr of billion of dollars worth of project in respons to low price .The main goal of the Doha meet seem to be assur market that countri whose economi depend on sell oil can still find way to collabor .At least one propos meet ha been scrub sinc Russia , Saudi Arabia and other produc agre , at a Doha meet in Februari , to consid the idea of a freez  on the condit that other major export came aboard . Non-OPEC countri includ Mexico , Brazil and Oman may attend thi week meet , and Norway may follow it tradit of send observers to such gather .We dont yet know what the freez realli mean in term of detail  how it is measur , and the durat ,  said Bhushan Bahre , an analyst at the research firm IH in Washington .One loom question is whether some accommod can be found to bring Iran into the fold . Iran is a member of OPEC , but it is also a sworn geopolit enemi of Saudi Arabia .The Iranian , whose product and export were slash by intern sanction over their nuclear program , are determin to regain their former share of the market now that most of those sanction have been lift .Iran oil minist , Bijan Zanganeh , is a season offici who will be unlik to agre publicli to a freez , analyst say , but will also be wari of caus price to collaps .A relat question is whether Saudi Arabia , hostil to grow Iranian influenc in the Middl East and lock in a fierc competit with Iran and other Persian Gulf produc for custom like China and India , will accept a compromis that make an except for Iran .In a recent interview with Bloomberg News , Moham bin Salman , the deputi crown princ and a crucial power broker in Saudi Arabia , suggest that the Saudi would not go along with a freez without Iran particip .And yet , there are limit to how much Iran could rais product even if it reject a freez .Sinc the relax of intern sanction last autumn , Iran ha increas product to slightli more than 3.2 million barrel a day from about 2.9 million . But becaus much of it product infrastructur is old and ricketi , Iran may be unabl to increas output significantli without spend time and money upgrad it oil field .They have alreadi ad 300-and-some-thousand barrel , and that tell me that they have pretti much top out for a while befor they can go higher ,  said Sadad al-Husseini , a former execut vice presid of the Saudi nation oil compani , Saudi Aramco , who now run Husseini Energi , a consult firm base in Dhahran .But other note that some other OPEC member with their own polit and econom problem , like Libya and Iraq , might feel compel to keep pump at current level or even step up product .If everyon produc at maximum capac , the price is at risk of revisit the low seen earlier thi year ,  said Harri Tchilinguirian , the head of commod strategi at BNP Pariba in London .He and other see littl chanc of a strong recoveri in oil price anytim soon without signific curtail by major oil-produc countri . And they say those reduct will not happen unless the Saudi lead the way on an agreement to cut back .I am not veri optimist about the propos Doha deal nor on the producers abil to manag a gradual improv in price ,  said Nordin Ait-Laoussin , a former energi minist of Algeria who now run Nalcosa , a consult firm base in Geneva .With the Saudi no-cut diktat ,  Mr. Ait-Laoussin said , I dont see product go down in the short term .

In truth , hi plan to reach 1,237 wa alreadi veri vulner ; Ted Cruz had built enough support by March 15 that even ad a modest share of Marco Rubio voter wa like to start him on the road to deni Mr. Trump a major .But after Mr. Trump loss Tuesday , the convent wisdom ha gone too far in the other direct . Hi path to 1,237 is still clear . It is certainli narrow , but it may requir him to do onli two challeng thing : win two tossup state , Indiana and California . There an argument he current favor in both .Ye , Mr. Trump lost badli in Wisconsin and , perhap more import , Mr. Cruz fare realli well . It could prove to be a turn point in the race for the Republican nomin , the moment when Mr. Trump opposit final coalesc behind a singl conserv candid .But the word could isnt a cop-out . It realli onli could be a turn point . It wont be if Mr. Cruz cant maintain such a larg share of the non-Trump vote .Mr. Cruz strength might have depend on a converg of factor that cant necessarili be repeat , like the strong support of the state G.O.P . establish ; one of the nation most engag elector ; strateg vote to deni Mr. Trump ; and a deep pool of religi and well-educ conserv .All of the factor that made it so easi for Mr. Cruz to consolid the anti-Trump vote will mostli fade in the Northeast , where the race turn next . Neither poll nor the polit establish will send a clear signal that Mr. Cruz  and onli Mr. Cruz  can beat Mr. Trump .John Kasich ha just as good a case . He ran ahead of Mr. Cruz in Massachusett , Vermont , New Hampshir and in the D.C. suburb . He also ran ahead of Mr. Cruz around Detroit and in the core of the Chicago metropolitan area .That didnt happen in Wisconsin  Mr. Cruz won Dane Counti , which includ Madison  but even there Mr. Kasich wa in strike distanc . He won 29 percent of the vote , far better than hi 14 percent statewid result .The poll in the Northeast suggest that Mr. Cruz would be lucki to end with the split of anti-Trump voter ( 38 percent for him and 29 percent for Mr. Kasich ) that he got in Madison . Mr. Kasich ha gener run ahead of Mr. Cruz in the Northeast .Not onli will Mr. Cruz struggl to maintain the same level of support among non-Trump voter , but the Northeastern state are also far more favor to Mr. Trump than Wisconsin . Wisconsin wa alway pois to be one of hi worst state ; the same measur suggest that Mr. Trump should approach or exceed 50 percent in some Northeastern state .The combin of better territori for Mr. Trump and a more divid field could allow Mr. Trump to win in the Northeastern corridor by huge deleg margin , perhap win more than 80 percent of them on April 19 ( New York ) and April 26 ( Connecticut , Delawar , Maryland , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island ) . Mr. Trump could win even more than that if he end up fare well in deepli Democrat district with few Republican and mani minor .Hi path is narrow enough that everi deleg count . He might need as much as 90 percent of the deleg from the Northeastern state and West Virginia to keep hi deleg target in California manag . But it not veri difficult to imagin Mr. Trump do so well . It basic what the poll say hed get , at least right now .The most import state that no one is talk about is Indiana . The contest there come one week after the Northeastern primari , and it arguabl the most balanc state left in the race . It ha a mix of both Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump strength , somewhat like the two state where theyv fought two of their closest race so far , North Carolina and Missouri .Indiana award it deleg on a winner-take-al basi by congression district , which could easili allow Mr. Trump or Mr. Cruz to claim most of the state 57 deleg with a modest victori .There isnt much poll data in Indiana , but Mr. Cruz would be a favorit if he could get the level of support among non-Trump voter that he did in Wisconsin . It would be a closer race than Wisconsin ; it the type of state where Mr. Trump ought to approach or exceed 40 percent of the vote , not the 35 percent he won in Wisconsin .The catch , though , is that there no guarante that Mr. Kasich will be that weak again . If anyth , after what is expect to be a wave of big win for Mr. Trump in the Northeastern state and potenti a seri of second-plac finish by Mr. Kasich , it might be more difficult for Mr. Cruz .Provid he domin in the Northeast as expect , Mr. Trump will have a good chanc to win the nomin if he can carri Indiana . Without it , it veri difficult for him to reach 1,237 . He would either have to win nearli all of California deleg or win a state where he an underdog  most like Montana  and post a clear win in California . It possibl , but it hard to see how he would be pois to do either of those thing if he lose in Indiana .If Mr. Trump win big in the Northeast , carri Indiana and pick up a few proport deleg in New Mexico , Oregon and Washington ( as he is all but assur to do ) , the race will come down to California on June 7 .It too far away to be veri confid about whether Mr. Trump would have a realist chanc to win the 70 percent or so of California deleg that he would need to win an outright major .But , at least right now , it look realist .Three top-tier pollster have shown that Mr. Trump could pull it off : the vaunt Field Poll , a Lo Angel Times/U.S.C . poll conduct by the promin Democrat firm GQR and a poll by the Public Polici Institut of California . The three poll found Mr. Trump ahead by 7 , 1 and 11 point among like Republican voter , with Mr. Trump win between 36 and 38 percent of the vote .There good reason to believ that Mr. Trump weakest poll  The Lo Angel Times/U.S.C . poll that show him ahead by one point among like voter  underestim hi strength . It show Mr. Trump ahead by seven point among all regist Republican , like the methodolog similar Field Poll . The detail result offer reason to think that Mr. Trump support might more close resembl that seven-point margin than the report one-point edg among like voter .The poll , which use the state voter registr file and therefor had inform on the past vote histori of respond , found that Mr. Trump wa ahead by five point among voter who particip in either the 2012 or 2014 Republican primari ( neither of which were especi high profil ) .It found he wa up by eight point among voter who particip in either the 2014 or 2012 gener elect . It found he wa up by two point among peopl who vote in both the low-turnout 2014 and 2012 primari . All consid , it is hard to imagin that Mr. Trump would be ahead by onli one point in a high-turnout primari  especi given the state penchant for earli vote .Mr. Trump would have a veri good shot to win 70 percent of the deleg with a seven-point victori , sinc the state award it deleg on a winner-take-al basi by congression district . He would still have at least a chanc to earn 70 percent of the deleg with a far smaller margin of victori .It also a state where Mr. Kasich could fare quit well , if he still relev . There are a lot of district in fairli liber stretch of coastal California where he could break 25 percent of the vote  which again might help Mr. Trump win with a lower share of the vote .Obvious a lot could chang between now and June , but thi is not a crazi scenario . It consist with the current state poll and it consist with how demograph similar state have vote so far thi cycl . If Mr. Cruz cant unifi Republican voter , it might just happen .', 'Mike Perli ha been presid and chief execut of Forb Media sinc 2010 .Q . Do you rememb the first time you becam a manag ?A . Right out of colleg , I co-found a small publish compani , in Camden , Main . Becaus I love the outdoor , we publish region magazin on travel and outdoor sport , like cano and hike . Iv alway felt that media is one of the great place where one can combin avoc and vocat . I rememb be much younger than everyon els , and though I want to be a leader , I had to take into account that the peopl I wa manag often had much more experi and were older than I wa .It wa an extraordinari opportun for me to hone my skill as a generalist . I learn to be a conductor rather than be the musician with a particular skill . And as time ha gone by , Iv come to realiz that be that generalist is actual a specialti . It a real privileg to be in the role where you can orchestr what other are do , but it doe becom a specialti , and it veri satisfi , to continu the metaphor , to listen to the music you can creat with the group .Q . What are the skill requir to play that conductor role well ?A . You have to be abl to listen care , you have to be patient , and you have to abl to articul to your group what the goal are , what will constitut success and then lay out , with some precis , what the overarch strateg goal are that will allow the group to get there . Perspect and be abl to see the whole pictur is realli vital , and more than anyth , listen , understand where you have talent , where you need talent , where the market opportun are , and then translat all of thi into strateg plan .Q. What the differ between a good leader and a great leader ?A . Great leader walk the talk . They lead by exampl . There isnt anyth they ask peopl to do theyr not will to do themselv . Theyr will to do the big thing and the littl thing that project real support and the wer in it together kind of feel . And by the way , for me that when it the most fun . If you live in an ivori tower  and , as Donald Trump said the other night , leadership is about tell peopl what to do and then have them do it  that doesnt sound fun to me .Q. Youv work as publish of Playboy , GQ and Men Health , as chief execut of Ziff Davi and now of Forb  public that are all veri differ in content and cultur . How do you adapt as a leader everi time ?A . The formula is alway the same . You have to creat a great product , first and foremost , and if that product find an audienc , youv realli creat the fundament of the busi becaus it is the connect between the content or product and the audienc that allow you to monet the busi . Fundament it true wherev you are . Iv alway had a lot of fun and enthusiasm for go into new place , appli that formula and crispli and clearli defin what you want to tri to accomplish . I had a great five year at Playboy and it a long time ago , and although it wa a veri differ world and subject matter than Forb , in a way there are some similar . Playboy wa also run by a famili and I wa the first person to have the titl of publish after Hugh Hefner , and I wa also the first non-famili member to becom a chief execut at Forb . So I guess by accid , it becom someth of a specialti of mine .Q . How did you manag that relationship with the found famili ?A . Actual , and I say thi with all appropri humil , when the board member [ at Forb ] hire me , they realli turn over the rein of the busi to me . They were unequivoc : They had made the decis to have someon from outsid , and though they were alway there to advis and help , they let me do the job .Q . You have made a lot of chang at Forb sinc youv arriv , shift the group toward the Internet . What were the difficulti of bring a 98-year-old institut into the 21st centuri ?A. Forb ha been an amaz compani , but most of it cultur and busi had been built around a print busi . When I came on board , it wa time to shift toward the Internet , while honor the old , becaus Forb still publish profit in the Unit State and we publish in 37 differ countri , so the print element of our busi is still veri strong . But we chang the cultur from thi old line of tradit print publish busi , and all that goe with that , to a digit , technology-bas busi , and that wa a veri big shift . Mani peopl welcom it becaus they could see where the busi and the industri wa go ; some peopl had to learn there were way to balanc the old cultur with the new one . Inevit , there is that kind of your in or your out moment with a new cultur , and there are some peopl who arent go to adapt to that .So you find the right way to let them move on . You cant pleas everyon as a chief .Q . But ideal , you want to get as mani employe to buy into your new vision . How do you do that ?A . Listen at first is critic import . Long-term employe have a lot of answer for a new C.E.O . They realli know what need to be done to creat success . Find the right time to transit from listen to creat a strateg plan , work close with your team , and move toward veri direct and sometim veri differ action , I think , is the most interest and excit part of the process . But it alway start with listen . Over the last five year , we went from 15 million uniqu visitor a month to almost 50 million a month , and wev had a lot of success through innov and a new approach of build the content platform and monet it . And one of the most gratifi thing for us is what I call boomerang staffer , peopl who had left sometim along the timelin and came back : Wev had at least two dozen of those .Q . What do you see a key challeng for a leader ?A . What Iv learn over the year is that everyon need to have their replac somewher in the organ . We should all be think about if wer not here , who is go to do our job ? Iv tri to solv thi by have a program in place where peopl are alway train their successor .Q . That could also creat a feel of uneas .A . Ye . But if you are more threaten by it than empow by it , then youv got to work on that .And it not just about train your replac : If you think your realli good at your job and you feel your perform at 110 percent , but you want to be a great manag and you need to mobil action from peopl , you have to be will to manag peopl who are onli go to be abl to do it at 80 to 90 percent of the effect that you have , and let go of respons that you know you can do better than anyon , to someon who is not as experienc and skill , but might do it at a veri effici rate . It a hard thing to do and learn , but it so import in organ .Q . How much have you chang as a leader over the year ?A. Im more patient , Im more will to wait a littl longer to pull the trigger on whatev decis one need to make in order to realli inform that decis with all the inform that is necessari .Again , it a fine balanc . You dont want to be slow , but I wa a young man in a hurri , and sometim Iv move more quickli than I wish I had . I still have that youth sens of urgenc , but now Im abl to temper it with the right kind of patienc .Q . What would you tell your younger self ?A. I wish Id learn to speak Spanish or Chines  not just to be more commun and fluent , becaus I can alway manag to get by , but to be more of a global citizen . Cultur , it say someth about you if you can speak more than your mother tongu .', 'SALLI MAE thi week becam the latest lender to make privat loan avail to parent who want to help pay for their child higher educ .Salli Mae , the largest privat student lender by loan origin , said it new parent loan wa more flexibl , and potenti less expens , than the feder government educ loan for parent and graduat student , known as Direct Plu loan .More privat lender are market parent loan , includ Citizen Bank and onlin lender like SoFi , as colleg cost continu to increas and the student debt burden grow . The averag debt for graduat senior at four-year colleg in 2014 wa nearli $ 29,000 , accord to the Institut for Colleg Access and Success .

But becaus the govern limit the amount that student can borrow , parent of student who fall short may turn to the feder Plu program or to privat lender . The proport of student graduat with the help of parent loan ha steadili increas over the last decad , accord to an analysi by Mark Kantrowitz , publish of the colleg select websit Cappex.com .Given the financi burden of colleg , parent are look for option . Most famili see pay for colleg as a share respons ,  said Charl Rocha , execut vice presid and chief market offic at Salli Mae , ad that the company research found that mani parent want a competit alternative to the Plu loan .The rate for feder Plu loan is current 6.84 percent .

But she said , there are potenti drawback borrow should weigh care . Privat loan , for instanc , will not guarante some of the same protect and option as feder Plu loan , she said , like the abil to discharg the debt becaus of a school close , loan defer for econom hardship , and potenti access to a repay option that can tie payment to the borrower incom .Also , Ms. Abernathi note , if a parent of an undergradu student appli for a Plu loan and wa deni , the student could borrow more money beyond the usual feder loan limit . So , she said , there are real reason to appli for parent Plu loan befor consid a privat parent loan.Borrow should also keep in mind their overal debt load , regardless of how favor term seem , Mr. Kantrowitz said . Turn to privat loan to financ your colleg educ may be a sign of overborrow ,  he ha written , sinc student who graduat with privat loan  or with feder Plu loan  are more like to have more debt than they can afford to repay .Here are some question and answer about parent loan : Who is elig to borrow Salli Mae new parent loan ?Parent of undergradu or graduat student , as well as other creditworthy adult , like grandpar , aunt and uncl , and guardian who want to help financ the student educ , can appli for the loan , Mr. Rocha said . Will interest rate on feder Direct Plu loan chang soon ?Rate are determin each spring under a formula set by Congress in 2013 , and take effect Juli 1 for the follow 12 month . ( While rate for new loan may chang annual , onc a loan is issu , it rate remain the same for the life of the loan . ) Where can I complain about problem with student loan ?The Consum Financi Protect Bureau take complaint about privat loan as well as about student loan servic , the compani that collect payment and otherwis overse your loan .If you have a problem with a feder loan that you can not resolv through your servic , you can contact the Depart of Education loan ombudsman .', 'Intuit is still one of the tech industry best-known name .

Bi partner up with a compani that empow entrepreneur ,  he said , Founder would not have the fear that a new ventur would realli put us in the street.The deal for Governor Ball follow a pattern for Live Nation , which in recent year ha taken control stake in a seri of independ promot around the countri . In 2013 , it bought half of Insomniac , the compani behind Electr Daisi Carniv . In 2014 , Live Nation made a deal with C3 Present , which ha Lollapalooza and Austin Citi Limit ; last year , it acquir Bonnaroo .Michael Rapino , the chief execut of Live Nation , said that the high risk of establish new festiv made it attract to acquir proven entiti .In New York , variou compani  includ Live Nation and A.E.G .  have tri and fail to establish festiv over the year , but among multiday pop festiv draw a broad audienc , onli Governor Ball ha had stay power , with 150,000 in attend last year over three day .( Danc festiv , like Electr Daisi Carniv and Electr Zoo , which is own by SFX Entertain , have also been success in New York . )In the U.S. , we were slow to evolv and build a festiv capabl ,  Mr. Rapino said .But even if these cannib an arena or amphitheat show , they are a veri import , viabl channel for artist to play ,  he ad .

They still die sooner than their richer neighbor , but the city life-expect gap wa smaller in 2014 than nearli everywher els , and it ha shrunk sinc 2001 even as gap grew nationwid .That trend may appear surpris . New York is one of the country most unequ and expens citi , where the poor struggl to find afford hous and the money and time to take care of themselv .But the research found that New York wa , in mani way , a model citi for factor that seem to predict where poor peopl live longer . It is a wealthi , highli educ citi with a high tax base . The local govern spend a lot on social servic for low-incom resid . It ha low rate of smoke and ha mani immigr , who tend to be healthier than native-born American .The research seem to suggest that live in proxim to the prefer  and tax base  of wealthi neighbor may help improv well-b . New York is not just a citi of rich and poor , but also one of walkabl sidewalk , a trans-fat ban and one of the most aggress anti-tobacco agenda of ani place in the Unit State .Even with incom inequ as big as it is , there are thing that govern can do to help the poor be healthier and live longer live ,  said Dr. Thoma Farley , who wa New York health commission dure the Bloomberg administr and now run Philadelphia health depart . It about combat the thing that are kill people.The find underscor public health research show that healthi habit matter . The JAMA paper found that sever measur of access to medic care had no clear relationship with longev among the poor . But there were correl with smoke , exercis and obes .There remain thi misconcept in our societi that health is determin by health care ,  said Dr. Steven Woolf , a professor and director of the Center on Societi and Health at Virginia Commonwealth Univers , who wrote an editori commend the research but offer some methodolog critic . Behavior have a huge influenc on health outcomes.In New York , public health offici have taken that notion to heart . Dure the period of the studi , New York made health a centerpiec of public polici . Though the Bloomberg administr often face critic for nanni state program , it pursu polici to reduc smoke and obes  crucial risk factor for diseas .State and citi law combin to give the citi the second-highest tobacco tax in the countri , after Chicago ; a singl pack of cigarett often cost more than $ 12 . And New York becam one of the first major citi to ban smoke in offic and bar . That chang affect the daili live of the city rich profession , but also of their pinch support staff . The city smoke rate plummet dure the 2000 , as it residents life expect rose .The citi also impos novel regul on restaur and food , ban tran fat that are associ with heart diseas , and requir chain restaur to post calori count on menu .

But the two-year-old agenc Funwork ha found a way to inject some humor into the busi , join it client and copywrit with a team of sketch and improv perform for collabor workshop that attempt to kick-start the creativ process .Paul Charney , the founder and chief execut of Funwork , said the method get at what he think is a fundament problem in the industri : how long it take to produc a campaign and get the client to sign off on it .The process hasnt chang , but people expect have ,  said Mr. Charney , who previous wa a creativ director at Goodbi Silverstein & Partner , describ an acceler busi environ where there are more platform than ever for advertis . Peopl are frustrat becaus it take so long.As a longtim sketch comedian  he is a found member and former artist director of the San Francisco troup Kill My Lobster  he knew there wa anoth way . But Mr. Charney did not think to combin the world of comedi and advertis until hi friend Craig Mangan , who at the time wa execut creativ director at BBDO San Francisco and ha sinc join Funwork , suggest that he tap some of hi comedian friend .It just made so much sens ,  Mr. Charney , 42 , said .

But the agenc wa a start-up , and he discov that invit them into the session to find out what might reson save time and money .What happen wa it made it better becaus they had idea , too , and it got everyon on the same page ,  he said .Funwork ha continu to refin it approach .

Stanley Reed', 'MOUNTAIN VIEW , Calif.  Three decad ago , at the dawn of the person comput age , Intuit shook up the financi softwar world with it first product , Quicken . The program , which wa center on the simpl notion of a virtual checkbook , suddenli made the PC a veri use tool for peopl to manag the chore of pay bill and track person financ .Last month , Intuit said goodby to that heritag and sold Quicken , which still ha loyal fan but weak growth prospect , to a privat equiti firm .Intuit , a Silicon Valley compani , is now focus on it TurboTax softwar , which ten of million of American use to file their tax return , and on QuickBook Onlin , an Internet-bas version of the company flagship bookkeep softwar for small busi and their account firm .Give up Quicken wa difficult , said Brad D. Smith , Intuit chief execut , dure an interview at the company lush green campu here . The kitchen tabl where the founder design the product in 1983 still sit in the cafeteria to inspir employe .But Intuit decid to shed it PC root and becom a cloud softwar compani . We tri to live up to be a 33-year-old start-up ,  Mr. Smith said . So the compani face a hard choic : Do we have thi beauti child that wev had for 33 year that we know wer not go to feed , or do we find it a new home ? Intuit is a classic case of a onetim disrupt be challeng by an upstart with a new approach and a simpler product . In thi case , the newcom is Xero , a New Zealand compani that ha woo small busi and account worldwid with a flexibl , onlin account system that can be use from a smartphon and can cost as littl as $ 9 a month .I find that for peopl whov never use ani kind of account softwar , the one Iv put on Xero are so happi with it ,  said Stacey L. Byrn , a certifi public account in San Diego who work with both companies product . They sing it prais becaus it so easi to use.In Intuit earli day , that what peopl said about Quicken and QuickBook , which made concept like cash flow , incom and expens , and balanc sheet access to nonaccount . But over time , the desktop PC version of the softwar becam more complic , and Intuit treat the onlin version as an afterthought .Xero , which start 10 year ago , saw an open . Intuit essenti own the market for small-busi account softwar in the Unit State and Canada , but it had ignor the rest of the world . At the same time , the migrat of data to the cloud and the rapid rise of smartphon were chang how small busi owner , mani of whom do not oper from offic , want to use technolog .Thi wa a once-in-a-lifetim land grab to get thi data off PC and into the cloud ,  Rod Druri , Xero chief execut and one of it founder , said via Skype from the company headquart in Wellington , New Zealand .Rather than build everyth itself , Xero open up it platform so that bank and financi app maker could plug their servic into it , offer user the abil to custom Xero and offer partner compani the abil to strengthen tie with their custom . After establish a strong foothold in New Zealand and Australia , Xero publicli sold share in Australia in 2012 , and it took it softwar to Britain and the Unit State .Intuit  and the account who reli on it softwar for so mani year  took notic .For so long it wa QuickBook , and that wa pretti much it ,  Ms. Byrn said . Rod Druri poke the bear . He woke up thi sleep giant.Intuit embark on a crash overhaul of it neglect , decade-old QuickBook Onlin product . The effort , code-nam Harmoni , result in a new version that , like Xero , wa easi to use and open to differ app  even one like PayPal and Squar that compet with some of Intuit own servic . Intuit also began to push hard into some oversea market , includ Australia , the heart of Xero territori .Mr. Smith said the decis to rebuild QuickBook Onlin as an open platform wa hotli debat within the compani . But the compani found that the averag small-busi owner use 16 to 20 app , and it conclud that it softwar need to accommod those outsid servic .If you have a competitor that your afraid to let work with your product becaus it better than your version of payrol or payment , then it not if youll get disrupt in the market , it when ,  Mr. Smith said . Wev got to win in the open market.QuickBook Onlin now connect with about 2,000 app , and the compani said that the open structur ha increas custom retent and help feed custom into the TurboTax side of the busi .TurboTax and Intuit tradit QuickBook desktop softwar have provid a financi cushion for the company strateg shift , and the divestitur of Quicken and some other busi brought in about $ 500 million thi year . But the pivot ha not been easi .They havent actual been veri success in convert exist QuickBook custom over to the onlin product ,  said Ross MacMillan , a softwar industri analyst with RBC Capit Market . While he laud the company intern effort , it cost money to go into these new market and you get less revenu per customer.Xero , which last year sold $ 111 million in addit share to the American ventur capit firm Accel Partner and Matrix Capit , ha establish itself as a clear altern to QuickBook , especi in foreign market . It now ha more than 600,000 pay custom worldwid .Intuit reinvent strategi is bear fruit . In the quarter that end on Jan. 31 , the compani finish with 1,257,000 subscrib to QuickBook Onlin , up 49 percent from the previou year . At the same time , sale of the desktop softwar remain robust , and TurboTax gain market share . The company overal revenu grew 23 percent .Intuit is also diversifi in relat busi , such as a loan marketplac that connect small busi with lender , with QuickBook data supplement tradit credit rate . ( Quicken Loan , a home mortgag lender that Intuit sold in 2002 , is no longer affili with the compani . )Analyst said Intuit willing to chang cours is one of it biggest strength .Whenev Intuit make a wrong turn , they quickli get off the gravel and back onto the blacktop ,  said Brent Thill , an analyst with UB . That whi the compani ha done so well for such a long time.He note that over a 10-year period , the return on Intuit stock have been larger and more consist than for some other leader in the industri , such as Microsoft or Oracl .Both Intuit and Xero are court account to help them sell their ware , as they have great influenc over the softwar use by their small-busi client . Although mani account still prefer tradit desktop softwar , the compani argu that by move onlin , account will save hour on bookkeep and can spend more time provid busi advic  or just get out of the offic .Ms. Byrn , a solo practition , said go to the cloud ha definit help her live the lifestyl she want .

( The suit wa thrown out . )It someth we live in constant fear of ,  said Steve Rankin , an execut produc , refer to prospect lawsuit . He ad : The Discoveri Channel is not an R-rate network . It seen by famili . We dont want to upset people.Enter the Blur Man Group .Just a few year ago , these design were have a difficult time find regular work . They were all graphic artist , and most of them were move through differ job in televis .Then the product compani Renegad 83 conceiv of Nake and Afraid and Discoveri gave it the green light and a Sunday night time slot . But the onli way to do a kind of nude Survivor wa to find peopl who could make it suitabl for broadcast .And what a job it is .Peopl talk about the whole aspect of nuditi ,  Mr. OSteen said . That goe away realli quick. He ad , There a job you have to do.For Mr. OSteen , the task is slightli complic by one more fact : Hi desk is opposit that of a 27-year-old who is the onli woman and , by far , the youngest member of the blur group . She is also hi wife .That the No . 1 question I get ,  he said . Dont you feel weird about your wife look at nake men all day ?  Well , I look at nake women all day.That doe not mean they do not have their disagr . Later in the day , Mr. OSteen and hi wife , Ilgin Esemenli , got into a debat over whether fake breast or real one were easier to blur .The real one are easier to work with ,  she said .While her colleagu insist there is a numb to all the nuditi that settl in after be expos to it all day , Ms. Esemenli confess that sometim she can not help but winc .Iv seen thing that Iv never seen befor ,  she said , look a littl pale .She ha learn to set limit , such as spend her lunchtim surf the web . Lunch and the unvarnish human bodi do not mix , she said .The job is not for everyon . Mr. OSteen estim that about 15 peopl have cycl through over the year , mani find it all a littl overwhelm .One person didnt last veri long , mayb two week top ,  Mr. OSteen said . He said , I just cant.And like ani job , it can be tediou . They labor at their comput use a stylu and a tablet to creat an amoeba-lik blur . It requir examin each episod , frame by frame , find and blur and care replac anyth  like a leaf  that got cover while blur . It take at least 50 hour to blur an entir episod .The point of the edit process is to make the blur as eleg as possibl , so that it doe not disrupt the view experi . Compar with some other show , the blur on Nake and Afraid is smaller and smoother .A blur is not necessarili appeal ,  Mr. OSteen said . Think of Cops.It took a season for the team to perfect the art of the blur , and they can be sensit to slight about the work they do .Theyll discount it : Oh , it just a blur job ,  said Johnni Hestich , a 49-year-old design , refer to other in hi industri . But it can get realli hard . Iv been do thi for three year , and Im think , Man , thi is kick my butt.Even so , it is hard to escap the fact that the show is about nake peopl .We were walk by the other day ,  said Mathild Bittner , an execut produc of the show , describ a scene at the Blur Man Group workstat . There are these crazi note . And it said , More vagina ,  extend the crotch shot ,  or bug bite vagina.Contest have been known to occasion make request . ( Some of the guy have ask for bigger blur and have been like , Help a brother out ,  Mr. Rankin said . ) But the blur is not meant to titil . Better-look peopl do not get smaller blur , the produc said , though peopl whose bodi are in less than top shape may get bigger one .To date , they said , no untoward bodi part had slip through the vet system and onto televis screen .The last line of defens is Adam Burn , 34 , a supervisor whose specialti is spot what other have miss . I can recogn a nippl from 600 yard in the background behind a leaf at thi point ,  he said .Reflect on the work , he began to laugh .Thank we stay pretti hectic around here ,  he said , so I dont have a lot of time to sit back and think about the path my life ha taken.', 'IT not rocket scienc . What shoot up quickli usual come back to earth .But a lot of peopl who hold leas to drill for oil on their land forgot that . Clark and Salli Keeshan , whose incom from leas on their Texa ranch fell by 60 percent in the last two year , are an except .So is John Baen , a colleg professor who moonlight as a negoti of drill leas . When oil price were at their peak , he said , the 150 well that were on hi land or land where he had negoti the price were bring in about $ 100,000 a month . Now , he said , the amount ha fallen by 80 to 90 percent .But both the Keeshan and Mr. Baen said they had learn lesson from previou oil and ga cycl . They treat the money they were receiv from leas on well on their land almost like found money .After 33 year in the oil and ga industri , Im somewhat familiar with the up and down cycl ,  Mr. Keeshan said . Wev alway had other mean of incom . Those leas have been secondari . We alway plan for the day when thi wa coming.But the low price of oil  around $ 45 a barrel , up from the $ 30 rang a few month ago but far from it $ 100-plu price two year ago  and what it ha done financi to peopl associ with the oil and ga industri serv as a remind to the rest of us : Some plan and a bit of pessim can go a long way in ani career with inher uncertainti , which is most of them .Befor the advent of frack , the drill right on mani piec of land  includ the Permian Basin in West Texa , Marcellu Shale in Pennsylvania and the Bakken Shale in North Dakota  were worthless .But the same technolog that led to boom in these area , and larg leas payment for the peopl who own the miner right on the land , contribut to the glut of oil worldwid and today low price . That , in turn , mean less drill .Oil is too easi to get out of the ground and too easi to find ,  said Paul Midkiff , nation director of the oil , ga and miner manag group at Well Fargo Privat Bank . I truli believ it wont go back up to $ 100 a barrel.Mr. Midkiff said there wa too much oversuppli , which would be use up onli if the global economi kick it into high gear.Yet a great reduct in cash flow for leasehold ha given them an opportun for estat plan , even if the opportun is not as great as in past bust .Mr. Keeshan said hi famili had set up a famili partnership to own it land and miner hold . These partnership allow the peopl set them up to get discount on the asset they are put in , in the belief that famili member would struggl to sell share in the partnership at full valu to outsid .Yet , he said , he recent had some of the family 10,000 acr of ranch land valu and it did not reflect the drop in oil price .The valu is up on the land even though wer not remov ani oil ,  he said . At some point , the commod will come back to the point where it will be econom to remov it again.And that ha been a challeng for estat planner . The exist of frack ha reduc the abil of apprais to justifi a greatli discount price for the land and the miner right .The drill success for wildcat drill wa one in 10 well ,  Mr. Midkiff said . When your talk about shale drill , your not go to find dri hole ani more . Your go to find it and frack it out and have success nine out of 10 time . That chang how we valu these things.The lower cash flow , though , ha scare off some peopl from estat plan , for fear that if they put the leas into irrevoc trust , which requir them to give up the cash flow , they will not have enough money to live on . That could be shortsight .Allison Elliott , senior wealth plan strategist for Well Fargo Privat Bank , said she work with a coupl in their 50 who were set to do extens estat plan at the peak of the oil boom . But as oil price fell , and their leas incom with it , they went from want to use both estat tax exempt , which were worth over $ 10 million , to use one , to not return her call .Bi the end of 2015 , their net worth wa about a third ,  she said . Their cash flow wa also cut back by two-third . But theyr still well abov the estat tax limits.Now , she said , they are look to put $ 3.5 million worth of leas into trust for their heir . They got to that point by realiz that even if price stay low , they would have enough to live on .A the money kept roll in , they start buy thing , but they had a safeti net first ,  she said . That wa where we show them that their safeti net wa go to work even if they didnt get more cash flow.Dane E. Crunk , manag director of Syntal Capit Partner , said that the peopl in the product and oil servic industri best pois to make it through thi downturn were the one with the lowest debt . And low debt is usual sensibl advic for anyon . But that wa more difficult to do in thi boom , where product compani ask servic firm to quickli add employe and equip , he said .Even some of our more savvi servic busi owner were forc to take on more debt and grow more quickli than they would have done ,  he said . It a realli sore subject right now , thi idea of partnership.For oil and ga execut , the drop ha been a mix bag . Jonathan A. Blumenth , manag director at Unit Capit in Dalla , said he had client who retir after work 35 year at compani like Exxon Mobil and their retir packag were good . He said that becaus interest rate were so low , the size of lump sum pension payout were as high as they had ever been .But execut at other oil compani like Chevron and BP , which have not been do as well and are lay off peopl befor they have fulli fund their pension , may find themselv struggl .Those defined-benefit plan look like a hockey stick ,  he said . You miss those last five year and it impactful.For peopl who thought , seemingli ration , that they could retir earli and the leas incom would replac their salari , the shock ha been mighti . In some case , given their career in the oil industri , these retire had other money invest in oil produc and pipelin compani that have lost valu .Mr. Blumenth said the client who manag the declin in oil price best were the one who could imagin other sector , like rental real estat , where the cash flow dri up when those properti were no longer rent .You have to show them what it look like if they dont have that incom ,  he said . Our process is to show you how the decis in your life impact the process . You have to make decis base on the thing you can control.Yet the best attitud with fluctuat wealth in a cyclic busi is to look at it as money to be save first and spent slowli .We never expect to receiv thi ,  Mrs. Keeshan said . Even when thing are bad , wer bless . Wev alway had good job . We were lucki we had a famili member who left thi to my mother and my aunt .

You charg veri littl per grain , but if they lie on enough of them , it add up .That is one way to think about what is go on at the world biggest cloud-comput compani . Instead of grain of sand , think about comput cycl , the activ that goe on in a comput server that is run softwar . For a price , think about one line of softwar code for two one-millionth of a penni .When toll that tini are paid often enough , they can make a billion-dollar busi . At Amazon Web Servic , which pioneer thi method late last year , there is no charg for the first million time a custom run code . Thereaft , A.W. . charg by the million time , or for the hundr of millisecond the comput is use .The scale at which we oper allow us to do innov thing ,  said Matt Wood , gener manag of product strategi at A.W. . When we get better economi of scale , well use that to our advantage.Thi econom of tini thing demonstr the global power of the few compani , includ Microsoft and Googl , that can make fortun count thi small and often . In other word , you have to be realli big to worri about make money off thing that are realli tini .Googl charg penni for search ad and spend $ 9.9 billion annual build out a global comput busi . Given enough softwar , in the realm of millionth of penni , it could do even better . Good luck to ani new entrant without the scale of these tech giant , howev , as custom come to expect that sort of cheap meter .Cloud-comput compani are not the onli one focus on the small . Bank , of cours , have for year been content take a sliver of big transact , so long as there are mani of them . Uber , which enabl privat car to temporarili becom taxi , can monitor driver and rider to adjust price and rout , chang the valu of thing throughout the day . An auto insur compani call Metromil charg custom base on how mani mile they drive a year .As tech compani get better at measur thing , other busi can pick up on the techniqu , and the fine count at the big cloud augur for more precis measur and price everywher . Mitch Hedberg joke about rice be a good meal when you are hungri for 2,000 of someth may turn out to be a propheci .A.W. . wa an earli leader in public cloud comput , or rent access to comput equip or softwar over an Internet connect . It start in 2006 as a bare note fluke by Amazon . It now ha over two million comput server and a million custom , includ Netflix , Shell and Brook Brother .Last week , Jeff Bezo , Amazon chief execut , gave A.W. . a long acknowledg in hi annual sharehold letter , declar that eventu most of the world will run on cloud like hi .The per-millionth price began last Novemb , in the A.W. . product Lambda . Lambda run a customer line of code in respons to a request , like look up a ZIP code when given an address . Custom never rent server , but pay for the moment of comput .Microsoft last month announc that it would have it own serverless product . Googl ha someth similar in earli releas , which is like to be a product by the third quarter of thi year .Microsoft is even tri to do A.W. . one better by microsl the cost to rent some of it softwar licens into the minut of actual use . Wer rent the sand and charg for the sun UV ray that hit you ,  said Scott Guthri , who run Microsoft cloud .For the big cloud , microsl is also a way of cope with a tough task : Custom have to feel like they can rent all the comput they want , and the provid must alway run at near full capac . If someon is use cycl , and not whole machin , more peopl can be pack in .The secret to cloud econom is util  everi minut unsold is money you dont get back ,  said Greg DeMichilli , the head of product for Google cloud . There are veri few of us who can work at thi scale.Like ani import new tech trend , the microsl , serverless model is alreadi attract investor and start-up eager to work in the new world  and in thi case , wari of what the giant will do next .An Oakland , Calif. , compani call Serverless make softwar that other engin can use to develop product for comput in Lambda and it ilk . We think thi could be the focal point of A.W.S. , even though I have no idea how they make money charg thi littl ,  said Austen Collin , the founder of Serverless .One way they make money is by ad on other product and server . So doe Mr. Collin think A.W. . could thwart hi busi ? It a mistak to think Amazon wont be in everyth ,  he said . We dont say , What if Amazon doe it ?

It is an articl of faith among poster that anti-racist are the real bigot , feminist are the actual sexist , and progress polit are , in effect , regress .Support for Mr. Trump on 4chan and similar site start off as a manic elat and disbelief at the spectacl of it all  he behav like us ! On Reddit at least , that elat ha turn into real support . In between meme photo and lengthi thread of mockeri , user also post call to action that offer tangibl benefit to Mr. Trump .

First-round bid are due soon , though some of those toss their hat in the ring may just be play along and learn more about how much the embattl compani is , well , embattl .Verizon  which own AOL , anoth Web 1.0 pioneer  is consid an earli front-runn . So mayb you can expect to have a bunch of purple-them icon preload on your next smartphon .Mike : That sound like an aw expect of what a giant compani think custom want , and is complet unground in realiti . In other word , it sound like a telco !But I want to get to a bigger thing Im preoccupi with . And that thing is Twitter , of cours , the medium of choic for self-cent journalist like myself .Twitter made a huge deal thi week about a new deal with the N.F.L. , in which Twitter will broadcast 10 Thursday night footbal game on Twitter itself . We still dont know exactli what it will look like , except that it will be live video of footbal .Thi is a big deal , particularli for a few reason : Facebook wa tri to make thi deal and did not . Amazon and Verizon were , too , but Twitter end up win the bid . Right now , mani of the major tech compani want to be known for their abil to present live content  see Facebook Live press onslaught as of late  so that automat a nice win for Twitter , branding-wis .Michael : It seem like everyon is pursu live video , right ? You had mention Facebook befor . And of cours Snapchat ha been push it own version of live , in the form of Snapchat stori . There a real belief that mobil is the new televis experi , and right now there are few bigger get for ani compani than the N.F.L. , which for mani is basic the modern-day equival of go to church .Mike : Right , exactli . The other thing that the big TV peopl are worri about is the wacki cord-cutt type  millenni , natch  and the web medium theyr take to instead of , say , sign up for a tradit cabl bundl like their parent befor them . That at least part of whi the N.F.L . and other media type are will to cut broadcast deal like these .The bigger win here , I think , is Twitter chanc to convinc peopl to come watch TV on Twitter and stick around long after . With these game , Twitter ha 10 chanc to show old and new user that it a worthwhil servic to come back to again and again . That someth theyv miss the opportun to do in the past . And that mean Twitter need to nail the experi of watch the game on the servic thi time around .Michael : That a big , open question . Yahoo  back to them again !  infam paid about $ 20 million to stream a Thursday-night game between the Jacksonvil Jaguar and the Buffalo Bill thi past season and drew just over 15 million viewer . Yahoo claim that it wa happi with the result , while other comment were decidedli less impress .Mayb Twitter will have more success thi time around .

Theyr in a place of tremend larg question mark right now.The deal may not happen without recent decis by two men .The first is Glenn W.

TiVo technolog ha gain traction with cabl oper around the world becaus it can also stream video from site like Netflix in their own box .

Instead , student get fund to cover current educ expens , and , in return , they agre to pay a percentag of their futur incom over an agreed-upon period of time . When that repay term end , so doe the student oblig , even if their total payment are less than the amount they receiv .Though an emerg corner of the educ financ industri , such program help eas the often crush debt mani American colleg student face after graduat , propon say . A small number of lender have test the model in recent year , but Purdu is the first American univers to offici embrac the concept .It look to us like it wa interest enough that somebodi ought to tri it ,  said Mitch Daniel , the univers presid and a former governor of Indiana . For some student , thi may be a veri prefer option to some of the privat loan that are out there.Purdu , in West Lafayett , Ind. , ha 30,000 undergradu student . Indiana resid pay annual tuition fee of $ 10,000 , while student from other state pay nearli $ 30,000 . It averag graduat with debt emerg owe $ 28,000 .The income-shar program will offer term base on students major and the project salari in those field . A comparison tool on Purdue websit let student estim how their own offer might look .A senior studi mechan engin , one of Purdue most popular major , could get $ 15,000 in return for a commit to pay 4.23 percent of hi or her incom for a bit less than eight year . Purdu estim that the engin would have a start salari of about $ 56,000 , and will be make monthli payment of $ 200 . In that hypothet situat , the student would eventu repay a total of $ 20,647 .But an English major can anticip a start salari of $ 34,000 , by Purdue calcul . For that student , the school would offer a differ packag , which might requir a higher percentag of incom over a longer period .Advoc of income-shar agreement , sometim call human capit contract , see them as a way to spread risk and prevent student from be lock into danger high debt payment . Afford is built in ,  said Robert M. Whelan Jr. , the chief execut of 13th Avenu Fund , a nonprofit compani that ran a small pilot test of the income-shar model with 11 student in California in 2012 and 2013 . Student debt is a crisi , and thi is an opportun to approach it in a differ way.The idea also intrigu some politician . Senat Marco Rubio of Florida , who introduc legisl two year ago to clarifi the legal framework around the agreement , and Gov . Chri Christi of New Jersey both spoke in favor of them on the Republican campaign trail . Lawmak in Oregon have been work for three year to develop a test program call Pay It Forward .Income-shar agreement oper in a legal gray zone , howev . No major regul have draft rule specif to address them , and Senat Rubio propos guidelin never made it out of committe . Financ firm are left larg on their own to tailor their product , fee and disclosur to consumer-protect law that are design for tradit loan .The Consum Financ Protect Bureau , the feder overs that mani view as the industry like regul , said it wa keep an eye on the offer .It is import that consum know up front the cost and risk of financi product ,  said Seth Frotman , the agency student loan ombudsman . Thi gener isnt the case for income-shar agreement , which can creat challeng for borrow tri to navig their repay options.Advoc say they think the concept will gain popular , and they point to success in place like Australia , where univers student have long repaid their educ cost through income-tax surcharg .The Obama administr ha been more wari . Presid Obama ha focus on make feder student loan more afford by expand their income-bas repay option . In Decemb , new rule took effect allow all feder borrow to choos a plan that cap their loan payment at no more than 10 percent of their monthli incom after graduat . After 20 year of payment  or 10 year for those who work for govern organ or most nonprofit  ani remain balanc for undergradu loan will be forgiven .The economist Milton Friedman is gener credit with origin the concept of an income-shar model to fund educ cost . In a 1955 essay , he propos that the govern or privat lender could buy a share in an individual earn prospects.The success of real-world attempt to carri out Mr. Friedman vision ha been mix , at least in the Unit State . Two financ firm , Upstart and Pave , caus a brief stir in 2012 when they began offer privat income-shar loan for individu link to their futur earn . Both end their program two year later and switch to make more convent loan instead .Paul Gu , one of Upstart founder , said the income-shar deal were a product that wa almost equal unpopular among borrow and investors. Lender were reluct to put money into contract with such unpredict return , and borrow struggl to figur out a fair price for their futur labor . In the end , most prefer to stick with the borrow option they better understood : tradit , interest-bear loan .In the two year it offer income-shar agreement , Upstart did 141 deal , total $ 2.7 million . Sinc chang model , it ha origin loan of nearli $ 370 million for 27,000 borrow .Onli a few hundr student in the Unit State have receiv money through income-shar arrang , and there is no long-term data yet on the result , but some particip say they are happi with how their deal ha work out for them .Alex Jasiulek , 24 , a 2013 graduat of Columbia Colleg in New York , got $ 25,000 for hi studi from Lumni , an organ that ha fund 8,000 income-shar loan in five countri , mainli in Latin America . He use the money to supplement hi grant and govern loan , which did not stretch far enough to cover all of hi cost for tuition , room and board .He now work in Lo Angel on program develop for an educ nonprofit and pay Lumni $ 160 a month , about 4.5 percent of hi incom . Hi repay term is 10 year .To me , it total worth it , even if I end up pay tripl or quadrupl what they actual gave me ,  he said . I wouldnt have been abl to go to Columbia if I didnt get that sourc of fund , and that experi wa priceless to me.Purdu is hold inform session for student thi month to explain it Back a Boiler program , which wa establish by the Purdu Research Foundat . About 200 student have request inform and applic form , which the school will begin accept in May , Mr. Daniel said .Mayb Purdu will be the Pie Piper ,  said Mr. Whelan of 13th Avenu Fund , who is tri to recruit partner and investor to expand hi organization financ . Mr. Daniel said he view hi school program as an experi  and he sanguin about the possibl that it will fail .It may prove to be too novel , or other option may emerg that obviat the need , but that for the student and their famili to decid ,  he said . It may or may not ever becom a real phenomenon , but it certainli catch people interest.Mr. Jasiulek said he hope more student would have the opportun he did to take advantag of the unusu fund model  but even more than that , he wish it were not necessari .Let be real ; it sad that a thing like thi ha to exist ,  he said .

Cellphon pump $ 148 million into the economi last year . The industri wa also the largest privat employ , suppli 140,000 job , a feat in a countri with 25 percent unemploy .But even that success is now look shaki .The Afghan govern ha again increas tax on the industri to replenish it coffer , cut into the industry shrink profit .

The nation telecommun infrastructur fell into disrepair under the Taliban from lack of invest . With few phone , most peopl had to walk into Tajikistan or Pakistan or use satellit phone to call their rel in the Afghan diaspora .After the Sept. 11 terrorist attack and the start of the war , Afghan Wireless , a joint ventur with the govern , open , and Roshan began a year later . Inspir by Roshan growth , three other player jump into the market .Over the last decad , the compani have invest over $ 2 billion in the countri , much of it in infrastructur like cellular tower . In thi countri of 32 million peopl , around 75 percent are now cellular servic subscrib . And the cost of a call ha plung sharpli .The telecom industri is one of the rare success stori in Afghanistan ,  said Walter Koenig , a former telecommun execut and senior commerci offic at the American embassi in Kabul who left the post last fall .While the industri remain vital to the Afghan economi , it growth ha also made it vulner . Aid money , which account for more than three-quart of the feder budget , is dri up , and Afghan govern offici are struggl to find new sourc of revenu to plug the shortfal .Telecom , which alreadi provid 10 percent of the feder budget , are again in their sight .

You can not sell below your cost forever.Even the Taliban are look at cellphon to supplement their budget . In Januari , the insurg announc that mobil phone compani must pay them a 10 percent tax or risk kidnap and more attack on their tower .The group blow up or burn cellphon tower as a show of strength against the govern or as retribut when compani will not turn off servic .

The commun ministri is meet with local elder to appli pressur on the Taliban to cut their attack , and it is ask the feder govern to increas secur measur .As they look to shore up revenu , mobil phone compani are tri to expand their data servic and bring more Afghan onlin . Increas the number of regular user will be difficult becaus the countri ha a high rate of illiteraci and littl onlin content in local languag . Most Afghan can not afford Internet access .The challeng are also compound by the govern monopoli of the country fiber optic network . Telecom compani must reli on their own satellit link and buy capac on the network to provid data to custom . But it is expens and not a reliabl sourc becaus of frequent cut in servic .Cellular compani are work with the president offic to wrest control of the fiber optic network from the state-run oper , which ha been critic for it poor manag , caprici rate-set and poor qualiti , accord to oper .The compani reach an agreement with the telecom ministri that would allow them to share the network and lay down their own cabl .

But as those deal add up , they are creat group that in some case domin local or region market . And they are rais question about whether the gaze of antitrust offici is direct in the right place .There a lot of consolid go on at a lot of level ,  said Leemor S. Dafni , a former feder offici who is a health economist at Northwestern Univers .She ad , I dont think the antitrust law are set up to stop it.Doctor and hospit are make the calcul that bigger is definit better . Consolid , they say , help them better coordin care and manag patient , make care more effect and less expens .Skeptic , howev , say that the small combin can eventu translat into higher cost . By gain market share , they say , hospit are abl to charg more for their care and gain more influenc about where patient are sent for lucr servic .Regul , meanwhil , are left with limit inform about the smaller deal , includ answer about whether they diminish competit , lead to higher price and lower-qu care .Dr. Farzad Mostashari , a former health offici in the Obama administr , describ what is take place as creep consolidation  be done at a pace that keep it away from pri eye .If you move slowli enough , mayb nobodi will notic ,  he said .Mani of the smaller deal go unreport , leav ani talli of them incomplet .

Thi mix of deal , which involv group like physician practic , hospit and nurs home , total some $ 175 billion .Becaus of the consolid , patient are more like to be get care from provid with formal tie to one anoth . The doctor who is employ by a hospit , for exampl , may send a patient for a CT scan at a facil own by the same hospit . Patient may be discourag from go to a provid outsid a given network , either by their insur or their doctor .The combin take place includ smaller hospit merger , like one in Arizona in March , when two hospit merg .

But Joseph DeMarco , a former prosecutor who is not involv in the case , said that alon would not be enough to overturn Judg Orenstein order .Appl can still argu that it doesnt have to compli with thi order ,  he said . The fact that it ha done so befor is relev but not , as a technic matter , legal binding.The method use by the F.B.I . to get into the San Bernardino phone ha been a topic of furiou specul at Appl and among encrypt expert .The Appl lawyer said on Friday that the compani had decid not to sue the F.B.I . to find out how it got into the phone , in part becaus Apple regular product updat would probabl give the method a short shelf life .The compani work constantli to find and fix vulner , and it lawyer said they were confid that it would render useless the tool use by the F.B.I . in the San Bernardino case , even if it never knew for sure the method involv .The company lawyer plan to argu that the San Bernardino phone use a new oper system and wa much harder to break into than the phone in the Brooklyn case would be . With a higher bar set , the compani will question whi the govern can not turn to the same marketplac of technician that help it crack the San Bernardino phone .Appl execut , includ Timothi D.

The autom servic , which includ start-up like Better and Wealthfront , along with offshoot from establish player like Schwab , have quickli amass $ 53 billion under manag in just a hand of year , accord to estim by Ait Group .But in recent month , critic have rais question about their limit .The flow of fund into robo-advis account is expect to acceler becaus of new feder regul , which requir all financi profession to put their customers interest first , at least when provid advic on their tax-advantag retir account . The rule , issu by the Labor Depart , are expect to push more custom into lower-cost invest .Ait predict that robo-advis will collect nearli $ 285 billion by 2017 , still a small portion of the $ 20 trillion in retail investors asset held at brokerag firm and regist invest advisori firm .Robo-advis were alreadi requir to follow the highest standard of consum protect  on everi dollar they manag , not just retir money  becaus most of them are regist invest advis . That mean they are requir to act as fiduciari , the legal term mean they must put custom ahead of all els . And it a banner the robo-advis wave proudli .Given their statu , the Labor Depart , which overse retir account , ha essenti given the robo-advis it bless , sinc mani firm avoid the conflict of interest embed in the way the brokerag industri and it armi of repres conduct their busi .But at the same time , other regul have rais concern about whether robo-advis are thorough enough when gather inform about investor . A robo-advis doe not ask about money held outsid of it servic , for exampl , which can provid a distort pictur of a customer financi stand . Other argu the robo-advis tri to wiggl out of too much respons in their custom agreement .The Massachusett Secur Divis recent put investor and the state-regist invest advis it overse  or those with less than $ 100 million in asset  on notic . In a paper issu thi month , it bluntli state that it did not believ an algorithm alon wa capabl of serv as a fiduciari , at least not the way robo-advis are structur now .I am not sure that mani investor , in mani case , can be adequ taken care of by answer question ,  said William F. Galvin , Massachusett secretari of the commonwealth , who liken the servic to driverless car . You need a human that is respond to them.Arthur Labi , a professor at Rutger Law School , said invest advis , as fiduciari , can limit the breadth of their relationship with client . Still , he doe not view robo-advis as fiduciari in the tradit sens becaus of their inabl to address subtleti that may aris in convers .They are not abl to provid the kind of person advic that a custom can get from a human on the phone or sit across the desk , where the custom can say : Oh , I have a new wrinkl . I might be inherit asset in the next 12 month ,  he said . Or : I may need to care for a sick parent . How will that impact the cash I need ? Mani robo-advis say that they make their limit clear , note that they are not in the busi of provid full-scal financi plan . But often that kind of inform is buri in the fine print .Be a fiduciari is not about the type of servic you offer , it about the qualiti of servic ,  said Adam Nash , chief execut of Wealthfront , a robo-advis manag more than $ 3 billion . There are financi planner help you figur out what type of hous you should buy . It not requir that everyon do that.The Massachusett regul and other industri critic argu that robo-advis should go further , evalu asset held elsewher befor invest customers money . ( Wealthfront and Better alreadi have technolog in place that let custom connect as mani account to their servic as they would like , give the firm a birds-ey view of a client asset . But for now they do not factor that into their invest analysi . )So exactli how deep are robo-advis requir to go ? The law and legal preced that govern invest advis , and that shape fiduciari duti , do not specif spell that out . But sever legal expert seem to agre that advis on a portion of an investor financi life is perfectli fine .It is not unusu for client to expressli or secretli withhold inform from their advis about other asset ,  said Mercer E. Bullard , a professor at the Univers of Mississippi School of Law . For exampl , if a 35-year-old say , Im not go to tell you what other asset I own and I want you to invest $ 100,000 for my retir ,  you can do that with disclosur that the alloc might be differ if you knew all of their assets.Kara M.

He had enter an agreement to buy a build for a breweri in Beacon , N.Y. , and found experienc brewmast to run it . He secur a $ 500,000 develop grant from New York State . But the project stall as he tri to get a loan to close on the build , renov it and buy the brew equip .What save both men wa a rel new twist on peer-to-p lend  borrow from affluent individu who are put up their own money .But that money came at high interest rate . Mr. Blosser borrow $ 250,000 at nearli 20 percent , while Mr. Gargiulo paid almost 15 percent on $ 2.9 million .In an era when money is cheap  the rate on a Small Busi Administr loan is under 4 percent  these entrepreneur said they had littl choic . They could receiv no money from a bank or accept high-interest money from individu .When you believ in your project , you do what you can ,  Mr. Gargiulo said . If we had deep pocket , we wouldnt have to do thi . I wouldnt have chosen to go down thi path . But in the end we got what we wanted.But one man tough choic is another remark return . In thi rarefi nich of peer-to-p lend , those with money to lend have a chanc to earn a high return in a fixed-income-lik invest and often have a say in how the money is use and the busi is run .The basic premis is bank cant realli servic ani of these guy , but we can ,  said Billi Procida , a former gener contractor and later a real estat develop in the New York area who presid over a $ 32 million fund made up mostli of hi money . You walk into my offic and under five minut you get a straight answer . We do due dilig , but it me and my 35 year of experience.For the last decad , peer-to-p lender like Prosper and Lend Club have offer a platform for individu to make loan to other peopl for an array of use , from pay off medic bill to build their busi . And those compani continu to grow , benefit from a combin of the share economi with return reminisc of the old Roman Empir . The top rate on a loan made through Prosper is 36 percent .Those compani allow small-tim lender to creat a portfolio of loan to individu and pool their risk . Affluent individu , on the other hand , are make loan one at a time . Thi would seem to increas the risk , but the lender say it allow them to know the individu , monitor the busi more close and help the compani get to a point where they can borrow from a tradit bank .With rate that can top 20 percent , even for 12 month , the affluent lender are fill a specif nich . They say one of their big attract is the speed with which individu or fund made up of individu can approv loan .Georg Haviland Jr. , director of the New Jersey Junior Titan , a hockey club , said he wa tri to keep up with the demand for the ice hockey program he run in Middletown , N.J . The club had bought a sport complex from the town in 2012 and built a 1,200-seat hockey arena with sky box .Last year , he said , he start the process to build an addit skate center to keep up with demand but spent over six month tri to get bank financ for it .In Januari , he said , he wa abl to borrow $ 300,000 for eight month from a group of individu lender to start construct on a rink he hope to have readi by Labor Day . It took him about three week .The process for the convent fund wa much longer ,  he said . It allow me to start my process without tap into my own money.As build get underway , he ha continu the process with a bank to replac the short-term financ . Until then , the group of lender , Assur Fund , allow Mr. Haviland to make weekli payment .For these lender , get paid back quickli is part of the game and an attract to the borrow .Wev had some peopl who use our financ for capit outlay , then they turn around and found S.B.A . financ and bought out the loan ,  said Michael Sinenski , who own sever restaur in New York and is the founder of Assur Fund . They need to do a deal , and later on they got a much lower rate and we provid the capit to get the deal done.These lender also look at project that bank might struggl with . That wa the case with the breweri in Beacon . Mr. Gargiulo said bank that look at the project thought it wa simpli too much money to invest . They couldnt understand the differ between a factori and a restaur ,  he said . We said , Wer a factori . Wer a wholesaler. That wa the challenge.Mr. Procida said he mostli lend to peopl he think have the right skill and instinct . And he said he like that Mr. Gargiulo wa well known and well like in the area .You onli came to us becaus a bank wouldnt lend to you  you had a credit problem or a challeng a bank couldnt lend to ,  he said . We cost more than a bank . But wer a lot cheaper than a partner . Our borrow use our money for a short period of time , six month to two years.If Mr. Procida hunch is wrong , though , hi money is secur by the real estat . He said he ha onli taken properti a coupl of time when someon default . He attribut that to be abl to offer advic from the career that made him wealthi .( Mr. Sinenski of Assur put the default rate with thi kind of lend at around 7 to 8 percent . )On a project in Philadelphia , the renov of the Divin Lorrain Hotel , Mr. Procida arrang a $ 34 million loan for the develop , Eric Blumenfeld , but he also work with him to secur $ 7 million in citi and state subsidi .On that deal , Mr. Procida said , he sold $ 24 million of the loan to a bank , which he expect will provid long-term financ when the hotel is finish .Despit have been a develop in Philadelphia for year , Mr. Blumenfeld said he could not get a bank to financ the renov .

Onc we get done , he get taken out , and Iv probabl creat $ 10 million of valu just by build it.Most of the loan made by wealthi individu are to small busi , particularli to compani younger than two year . There are so mani healthi busi that cant get loan but are a year old ,  said Mr. Sinenski of Assur Fund .When these lender  big or small  step in , they stand to make a substanti return .

Here some of what they found : Among broker employ from 2005 to 2015 , 7.28 percent had at least one disclosur in their industri record for a settl consum complaint or wors . Mani household-nam firm have doubl the percentag of broker with such mark . Oppenheim top the list at 19.6 percent . Five of the 10 counti with the highest percentag of broker with disclosur are in Florida .To spot-check these figur , I look up all 50 Oppenheim broker within 25 mile or so of Palm Beach . Seventeen of them  or 34 percent  had spotti record , and some had nine or 10 thing to disclos . Then I call them all and tri to ask them how they would advis reader to evalu their record . The compani acknowledg that it ha some work to do .Befor we get there , howev , let stop and talk about thi data , where it come from and some of the assumpt the research made .The brokerag industri is uniqu , or nearli so , in that there is an easi way for consum to look up and read about mani of the problem that it employe have had in the past . That happen through a websit call BrokerCheck maintain by the Financi Industri Regulatori Author , the nongovern industri regul known as Finra .When custom get into disput with their broker , the result of ani formal proceed ( often arbitr in thi industri , as in so mani other ) gener end up in BrokerCheck . So do ani penalti from regul or other . If the broker ha been fire for caus , thi , too , will gener show up , as will ani person tax lien on broker or bankruptci that theyv file .Ani of these item result in what the databas refer to as a disclosur . A disclosur is not evid of wrongdo in and of itself , becaus there are disclosur even when a custom bring a complaint and arbitr dismiss it . Still , ani disclosur ought to give a custom or potenti custom paus .So now come our academ , Mark Egan of the Carlson School of Manag at the Univers of Minnesota and Gregor Matvo and Amit Seru of the Booth School of Busi at the Univers of Chicago . Professor Matvo said that the three had not pursu the research with ani particular thesi or agenda , just curios when they realiz that they could run industrywid number . If you told us wed have 1 percent , that would have been reason to me ,  he said . They end up with 7.28 percent . He said he wa surpris by the number of repeat offend .The analysi reli on a particular definit of misconduct. To them , it is fair to describ settl consum complaint as misconduct . After all , the median settlement amount that aggriev consum receiv is $ 40,000 , which would pay for a lot of a lawyer time to defend an innoc broker . A quarter of the settlement exceed $ 120,000 , though settlement gener includ boilerpl languag about not have admit or deni wrongdo .Industri repres find thi definit of misconduct absurd . Both parti have their own incent to settl ,  wrote Kevin Carrol , manag director and associ gener counsel at the Secur Industri and Financi Market Associ , in a blog post about the paper . Case frequent settl in order to save time and money , to reduc risk and exposur , and to ensur final . Mani if not most case settl for reason have noth to do with alleg misconduct. Plu , plenti of investor with buyer remors blame their broker , even when they sign off on riski invest themselv , especi after the stock market collaps in 2008 and earli 2009 .Professor Matvo said he still believ that their definit of misconduct wa conserv . He ad that even when broker had a complaint that wa dismiss or drop , that wa still predict of futur problem . And broker who do have disclosur for misconduct , by the professors definit , are five time as like , on averag , to end up with similar mark on their record in the futur as all other broker . ( The other broker disclosur that meet the professors definit of misconduct are regulatori action , a job chang after an alleg , custom disput with actual award and complet civil action . )It also possibl that the research are undercount misconduct . Mani custom have no idea that their broker are work them over , and other never report it if they do figur it out . Some broker manag to strip their BrokerCheck file clean through a process call expung . And the research acknowledg that their number for some firm may includ mani peopl regist with Finra who dont have ani custom access , thu skew the data , sinc no custom would ever complain about them . They hope to address thi in futur updat to the paper . ( Anoth confus part of the paper is that differ branch of the same parent , includ UB and Well Fargo , show up at both the top and bottom of the misconduct list . )But whatev the correct definit of misconduct , down in Florida , Oppenheimer roster of broker would rais most reason people eyebrow . Most of the profession there with disclosur have more than one . One person who recent left the firm had a no-contest plea for feloni assault on hi record .Michael Sandberg , a 26-year industri veteran , ha 10 disclosur , includ seven settlement and a $ 10,000 fine from 2005 for frequent buy and sell of mutual fund share in client account . Charl Shalmi , who ha been in the busi for 31 year , ha nine disclosur , includ a decade-old two-year revoc of hi abil to sell secur in Illinoi . Neither man respond to messag seek comment and none of their colleagu with pockmark record would talk to me on the record either .Doe Oppenheim have specif standard for whom it is will to hire and retain ? Ye , accord to the compani , but they are proprietari . In a statement , the compani said that it had replac the branch manag in Boca Raton , Fla . It ad that it wa also make sweeping chang to it team of broker there and had alreadi ask a number of them to leav .Oppenheim also ha a new chief complianc offic , Doug Siegel . In an interview , he said that he knew the firm reput when he began the job and that the professors studi had becom part of hi assess . What would he have consum make of the 19 percent misconduct figur for the firm over all or the 34 percent figur in Florida ? Come to a conclus base on big statist analys is difficult ,  he said .He right about that . After all , 80 percent of Oppenheimer brokerag forc ha a clean record , and mani of them would no doubt do right by consum . The new fiduciari rule  and ever-increas complianc effort at Oppenheim and elsewher in the industri  will probabl help some .Still , you can not be too wari when turn your money over to a financi profession . If you or your rel are in Florida or your broker is , it sure seem that you need to be especi care . The research note that in gener , brokerag custom who are older , less educ and wealthier tend to end up in troubl most often .If your broker doe have disclosur ( and you should check everi year or so for new one that may have pop up ) , ask some question . If the respons is defens , that ought to tell you someth . If broker dont like answer your inquiri , perhap they ought to work in an industri where there isnt as much disclosur .If the respons is unintellig , keep press . If the broker have gotten in troubl for push complex product that you ( or they ) dont understand , then that is a signific sign as well . The money manag industri is much too complic , and it not your job to translat the gibberish that some of it sale agent spew .For ani of these convers to happen , howev , you have to dive into BrokerCheck in the first place . It take 60 second . Do it right now ; youll find link to the record of mani financi planner in there as well .Too mani peopl do not do thi , which is a sourc of endless frustrat and sad to peopl like Professor Matvo .

Mr. Zhang said hi father had known as a boy what it meant to go hungri , but hi parents frugal kept him from ever have to go without . Still , he work as a babysitt and a busboy , while still achiev enough in the classroom to earn accept to Yale .After colleg , Mr. Zhang spent two year at Morgan Stanley on a team that analyz the firm own strategi and transact . He follow that up with two year in privat equiti , where firm use money from high-net-worth individu and other to invest in compani . Eventu , it would tri to sell those compani at a profit and put money back in the pocket of the now higher-net-worth individu .In earli 2015 , he got a LinkedIn messag from a recruit at NerdWallet , the first time hed heard of the compani . But when he learn more about it , the move made perfect sens to him . I spent two year help the bank make more money and two year help high-net-worth peopl make more ,  he said . For the forese futur , I could help everyday consum think smarter about their money.He wa hire to help think through the company approach to student and person loan . The site alreadi had some inform about the peril of payday loan . A repres from the N.A.A.C.P . in Alabama had note NerdWallet interest in the topic and invit Mr. Zhang to speak at a confer .Speak there and meet peopl who were up to their ear in such loan radic him . It also got him think . Somebodi had to be invest money in these lender , given how larg they had becom . But who were they ? I had live in that world and wa familiar with how deal get done ,  he said . Some insecur overachiev tri to find a deal , write a memo , build a model , and then a vice presid or partner goe and pitch it.Hi instinct were right : A privat equiti firm call JLL Partner had put money into ACE Cash Express , a payday lender that had just paid $ 10 million in refund and penalti in the wake of a Consum Financi Protect Bureau enforc action . And who wa invest in JLL ? Univers endow and state pension fund , includ the one in New Jersey , where payday lend is illeg .While the invest themselv didnt violat ani rule , Mr. Zhang said he didnt think the financi aid recipi who benefit from endow earn and retir state worker would feel good about it . So he and hi colleagu pass their find on to variou media organ .Beverli Brown Ruggia , an organ with New Jersey Citizen Action , first read about it in Fortun . I wa incredul ,  she said . Her organ and sever other polici , advocaci and faith-bas group band togeth and help persuad the state to get out of the invest .Next , Mr. Zhang turn to figur out how to keep more consum away from the ACE of the world . He and hi colleagu knew from a Pew Charit Trust report on payday lend that about one-third of borrow got their loan onlin and tend to pay more when they did . So NerdWallet set about tri to attract them to it site first .A small , earli experi intend to draw borrow to the site drew hundr of click from Googl each day from peopl look for cheap payday loan . Lender approach NerdWallet with an offer to pay it $ 60 in commiss on a $ 200 loan , know that mani borrow end up repeatedli roll their loan over into new loan and pay effect annual interest rate well into the three figur .I ask them whether they would take the $ 60 and give that discount to the borrow , but they wouldnt ,  Mr. Zhang said . Their busi model is base on repeat custom , so if someon repay their loan , they dont make money.Eventu , NerdWallet settl on a pro bono effort wherebi it would earn no commiss and send consum onli to nonprofit lender with lower interest rate or to government organ that offer short-term assist . It began on Friday , with link to 44 entiti in California and Texa . The compani plan to add more over time .While NerdWallet will make no money in the short term from it payday lend redirect , it is well awar that peopl in financi troubl now could be custom next year . If we do thi well , we can rehabilit peopl in a tough spot ,  Mr. Zhang said . In six month , when she need a credit card or want to start invest , shell come back . That the best type of bet that we can make.About those credit card : There someth pretti rich about a compani like NerdWallet , which earn commiss from credit card issuer that charg double-digit interest rate , channel those commiss toward keep other custom away from the triple-digit effect interest rate that the payday lender charg . But hey , at least NerdWallet isnt use that money to push more credit card .Mr. Zhang understand how thi look . We wrestl with it everi day ,  he said . To him , the benefit of credit card outweigh the problem they caus for the mani million of peopl who use them without get into year of debt .That not someth , howev , that he can say about lend oper that target peopl who are down on their luck . There is no instanc ,  he said , where Id ever encourag peopl to get a payday loan.', 'The veteran televis execut Ben Silverman announc on Thursday that he had land at the entertain studio Propag Content as it new chairman and co-chief execut .Mr. Silverman is join forc with hi longtim collabor Howard T.

You actual feel it restart ,  he said . In terribl stop-and-go traffic thi thing come on and off constantli . In 20 minut you can have 50 stop-and-start cycl . It can drive you total insane.Merced defend it technolog , known as ECO Start/Stop , call it one of the most seamless system ,  accord to Christian Bokich , a compani spokesman . Custom with ani concern alway have the option of defeat the system each time they enter and start the vehicle.While start-stop technolog may make some peopl crazi , the technolog is here to stay .That becaus manufactur are under intens pressur to meet strict fuel economi standard by 2025 and they are use ever more creativ way to wring out everi last bit of fuel effici from convent gasolin and diesel engin .Other approach includ increas transmiss from six speed to nine or 10 ; use electr rather than mechan power steer system ; decreas tire roll resist ; and directli inject fuel at high pressur into the cylind .The fuel save with start-stop can add up . Under averag drive condit , save are 3 percent to 5 percent . But with a lot of stop and traffic light that stay red for extend period , that can rise to 10 percent , said Robert Fascetti , vice presid for powertrain at Ford .Start-stop clearli help use less ga ,  Mr. Fascetti said . There no debat . You save fuel when the engin is off.Dr. Tao said he had not experienc that level of save ; he estim the cut in fuel use to be about one mile per gallon .Regardless , start-stop is destin to be on the major of car in the next few year . Ford now ha it as a standard featur on it Escap and Focu vehicl , and on some engin in it top-sel F-150 pickup truck . Eventu , 70 percent of Ford model will offer it , Mr. Fascetti said .By the 2018 model year , all Buick will come equip with the technolog . Current Buick Encor and Envis offer it . In addit , it is avail on sever model from Cadillac and Chevrolet , includ the AT , Cruze , Impala and Malibu .At Fiat Chrysler , the Pacifica offer the technolog , and the major of our vehicl will have it over time ,  said Mike Duhaim , a Fiat Chrysler powertrain director .Still , not mani American have yet experienc the technolog . And despit it environment and fuel-sav benefit , mani who do have it , like Dr. Tao , dont like it .Our primari research say almost to a person , peopl say they turn off their stop-start system ,  said Tim Barn , a director of product plan for Mazda in the Unit State .That one of the reason that Mazda ha no plan to introduc the technolog in the Unit State , even though Mazda ha been offer it in Japan sinc 2010 .For the technolog to work for consum , the experi need to be seamless , manufactur say .Restart must be fast , smooth , with no nois and littl vibrat ,  said Ulrich Muehleisen , head of market and product develop for Robert Bosch , a compani that ha sold 15 million start-stop unit in Europ sinc 2007 .Most manufactur use similar technolog to creat and manag their own system . Heavy-duti batteri provid the juic necessari for 10 time the number of start of standard vehicl . Rug starter motor last longer . Engin mount are design to be place to minim vibrat .Regardless of techniqu , vehicl with the technolog are meant to start instantan .Take your foot off the brake and the car will start by the time you hit the acceler ,  Mr. Muehleisen said . It just a coupl of a hundr millisecond ,  compar to the sever second it typic take to start a vehicl use a key .Engin in the vehicl with the system will not alway stop when the vehicl doe . A sophist set of sensor monitor the engin and cabin temperatur . If the air-condit need to run continu to cool the interior , the engin will restart or stay on . In stop-and-go freeway traffic , the engin will most like remain run to avoid repetiti , annoy restart . And if the batteri is get close to the end of it life , the vehicle engin will not shut off , no matter how perfect the other road condit are .In addit to custom resist , the technolog face other obstacl to consum accept .A vehicle offici mileag estim as seen in a new car window sticker reflect the exist of a start-stop system . But in calcul those number , the Environment Protect Agenc assum that half the peopl who have the technolog disabl it , reduc the sticker appeal to fuel-economy-mind car buyer .And typic fuel save also wont save a consum that much money . With today ga price , a 5 percent save in fuel may amount to around $ 40 a year , or about 80 cent a week .But minor cost save and consum disinterest are not dissuad manufactur from introduc the technolog .At some point , virtual everi vehicl will have stop-start ,  Mr. Muehleisen of Bosch said . Onc you get use to it , youll wonder whi the engin is run when your stop . It like brush your teeth with the water on.', 'Corpor America fought the law and the law won .Thi is the clear conclus look at thi week deal-kil action . So far , the govern ha destroy the $ 152 billion deal between Allergan and Pfizer by institut stricter tax rule , su to block the $ 35 billion Halliburton-Bak Hugh merger on antitrust ground , and su the $ 16 billion activist fund ValueAct Capit for fail to file an antitrust notif regard it invest in Baker Hugh and Halliburton . The press describ the ValueAct lawsuit in apocalypt term as a lawsuit to defin activism.And it onli Thursday .With the flurri of event there are alway gener lesson , and here are four .In today world , govern action is go to come from the agenc , not from Congress . The agenc are increasingli aggress in exercis power . Thi is the Treasuri Department third set of rule aim at curb so-cal invers , where an American compani merg with a foreign compani and move abroad to cut it tax bill . As the law professor Victor Fleischer note , the Treasury rule may go too far , subject them to a possibl legal challeng . But it doesnt matter , sinc no one would delay a deal for the year necessari to challeng these regul . Allergan and Pfizer wait less than 24 hour to end their care drawn deal after the announc of Treasury action .Action goe beyond invers . The government suit against Baker Hugh and Halliburton , which come while oil product is depress , is yet anoth time when compani miscalcul the government willing to interven . And in the realm of nation secur , the interag Committe on Foreign Invest in the Unit State ha been activ challeng deal , put a chill on the ardor of Chines acquir .In the futur , whether it is tax , antitrust or nation secur , deal maker today will have to worri about the regul act alon , which may be enough to kill most deal whether or not the govern win . Merger and acquisit lawyer are about to be eclips by their regulatori colleagu , and those firm with the best antitrust and other regulatori practic will have an edg .Back in Novemb I call the Pfizer-Allergan tie-up silly. The fact that the chief execut of Pfizer , Ian C. Read , actual believ the govern would let thi deal go through show how divorc from realiti execut can be . Mr. Read get a raspberri for wast everyone time and money . There is a silver line , though . With the hundr of million of dollar save on advis fee , Pfizer can now use it cash to lobbi Congress to reform our broken tax system .The govern ha shown it willing to push back on both antitrust and nation secur ground in almost everi borderlin case . Everi deal maker ha been on notic sinc the govern kill the AT & T ; and T-Mobil deal in 2011 despit AT & T ; have to pay a $ 4 billion breakup fee . Despit allow some airlin merger to go through , the govern ha cast a wari eye on larg merger that shrink market to a few player . Deal maker need to take thi regulatori risk more serious , particularli in today polit environ  it not a time to say that we can announc a deal and bulli the govern to accept our posit .The invest banker and lawyer invent invers and stoke the craze , kill it in their zeal to sell thi lucr concept . Banker were a big loser thi week .Are the advis to blame for all of thi ? On one hand , they are mere advis and recommend a cours of action . It is the client who ultim make the decis . On the other hand , there is no doubt that while peddl thi type of transact the advis knew of the seriou risk of govern backlash but did not back down as invers caught on in corpor America .Thi is also true in the case of these antitrust-bend deal  sure the lawyer must have advis their client of the real risk , and yet the client plow ahead . It all mean that perhap it is time for advis to do some deep reflect on when and how to tell client no .The ValueAct lawsuit wa probabl the most surpris of the three announc thi week . In gener , ani acquisit of more than $ 78.2 million is requir to be report befor it occur to the Feder Trade Commiss or Justic Depart under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improv Act . Thi give the govern a 30-day period to review the transact for antitrust purpos . Failur to file thi notif could incur a penalti of up to $ 16,000 a day .There is an except to thi file requir , howev , if the transact is sole for the purpos of investment. The govern ha accus ValueAct of violat thi standard sinc ValueAct intend to obtain access to manag , to learn inform about the merger and the companies strategi in privat convers with senior execut , to influenc those execut to improv the chanc that the merger would be complet , and to influenc other busi decisions.It hard to know what to make of these accus . They look an aw lot like what ani big sharehold doe in the ordinari cours of busi , which is whi there is talk of thi suit chill or even stop some activ .But here the thing . The government complaint fail to mention that ValueAct did actual file a notif in Novemb 2015 after it own evalu led it to be more activ engag and seek a board seat at Baker Hugh . At first glanc , the government stanc on what sole for the purposes mean would prevent activist from present compens propos or discuss busi strategi with manag , which are differ than seek to push the compani to do someth . Ultim , we need ValueAct side of the stori to make ani definit assess . It could all be just a product of the intens scrutini that the Halliburton-Bak Hugh deal ha receiv , and ValueAct is collater damag .The suit wont end sharehold activ , though it may push more activist fund to file notif and pay the file fee , which can be as much as $ 280,000 , a nice revenu boon for the govern . In other word , thi is an import case , but it probabl should not chang what peopl are do until we have a better view of the fact and more sober think .And that goe with the theme of thi week .

It not even discuss inform ,  he said at the confer .Still , the central bank acknowledg it deep concern about the risk that the eurozone econom doldrum , character by a worrisom low rate of inflat , could devolv into outright deflat , a viciou circl of fall price and demand that can undercut corpor profit and caus unemploy to soar .A grow number of economist argu that central bank must use radic measur  even helicopt money , larg a textbook notion  to prevent deflat from becom entrench in Europ .The central bank worri were evid in a summari publish Thursday of deliber by the central bank policy-mak bodi , the Govern Council , at it meet last month . Council member , the summari made clear , were alarm that inflat show a declin even without factor in energi price . Previous , they could attribut low inflat to the fall price of oil .The declin record in Februari wa a new element ,  the summari said . Member of the council agre that euro area growth momentum would be slower and inflat lower for longer than previous anticipated.Those concern had prompt the central bank to undertak a seri of measur , some unpreced , intend to deliv a jolt to the eurozon economi and arrest a declin in consum price . The action , announc on March 10 , includ print money to buy bond issu by corpor , and offer to pay bank to lend money to their custom .We have a deflat risk ,  Ignazio Visco , a council member and the governor of Italy central bank , said at the Frankfurt confer on Thursday .The event wa a gather of economist and other analyst who follow central bank , some of whom express doubt that the E.C.B. action so far would be power enough to counteract the effect on the eurozon economi of a slowdown in global trade .The term helicopt money wa coin in 1969 by the economist and Nobel laureat Milton Friedman , more as a thought experi than as a seriou polici propos . The idea wa that when convent polici tool no longer work , central bank could print bill and toss them from helicopt to eager citizen who would spend the money and stimul the economi .Deflat set in when fall price prompt peopl to delay purchas becaus they expect price to fall even further . Consum spend and invest collaps , compani dismiss worker , and spend fall even further as peopl lose their job and incom . Central banker fear deflat becaus onc it set in , it is notori difficult to revers .Helicopt money ha long been seen as a hypothet last resort . But the idea ha been taken more serious as inflat in the eurozon ha remain stubbornli near zero . Inflat ha been below 0.5 percent sinc Juli 2014 and wa at neg level in both Februari and March .The E.C.B . doe not expect inflat to reach the bank offici target of close to , but below , 2 percent until after 2018 .We face continu disinflationari forc ,  Mario Draghi , the presid of the E.C.B. , said in the bank annual report , publish on Thursday .But hand out free money would not be easi . The E.C.B . ha no procedur for distribut cash fairli to the roughli 335 million peopl in the eurozon . One mechan might be to give everyon a tax cut . But that is probabl illeg under eurozon rule , which bar the bank from get involv in member governments financ .Charl Bean , a professor at the London School of Econom , said at the Frankfurt confer that Britain , arguabl , had alreadi distribut helicopt money . The Bank of England ha print money to purchas govern bond , and the govern in turn ha made tax cut .Peopl mistakenli think thi is some magic polici that ha not yet been tri ,  Mr. Bean said . In realiti , it a mix of polici .Some economist say that the E.C.B . ha alreadi introduc a form of helicopt money by decid last month to offer interest-fre fund to bank , on the condit that they lend the money to busi and consum . If bank meet certain lend benchmark , they will get a bonu from the E.C.B . in addit to the interest-fre fund . In effect , the commerci bank will be paid by the central bank to lend money .But central bank offici clearli do not want to rais expect that they are about to start carpet-bomb the eurozon with freshli mint bill .Vtor Constncio , the vice presid of the central bank , also rule out helicopt money dure an appear at the European Parliament on Thursday .

They and their famili vacat togeth on the maiden voyag of the Disney cruis ship Fantasi , and share sever trip to Walt Disney World .Mr. Stagg had everi reason to believ he wa on track to succeed Mr. Iger . Dure the year sinc Mr. Stagg wa name to the No . 2 posit , Disney had move from one triumph to anoth : an Oscar for the reviv anim unit Big Hero 6 ; lavish prais and box offic success for Pixar Insid Out ;  vindic of the Marvel acquisit with anoth smash Avengers hit ; the record-set open of Star War : The Forc Awakens.And then there is Disney most ambiti project of all : the immin unveil of it $ 5.5 billion Shanghai Disneyland resort , Mr. Staggs major achiev as theme park chairman . In the year that Mr. Stagg wa chief oper offic , first-quart earn jump 36 percent to a record $ 2.9 billion .True , Disney stock price , along with market averag , wa down . After peak at over $ 120 in August , it wa trade thi week at just under $ 100 . But that declin wa set off by Mr. Iger comment to analyst that growth at the Disney-own sport network ESPN wa slow under subscrib loss . Until then , Disney had been the best-perform stock in the Dow Jone industri averag for 2015 .Mr. Iger also appear to be lay the groundwork for hi own next act : to lead the Nation Footbal League return to Lo Angel after a 21-year absenc . Mr. Iger wa grant option to buy minor stake in the Raider and Charger and wa name chairman of a hold compani that would move the team to Lo Angel and overse the build of a new stadium and adjac real estat develop .Mr. Iger met with N.F.L . owner in Houston in Januari to pitch the deal . Accord to a detail account in the Disney-own ESPN the Magazin , Mr. Iger legendari charm fell flat with the leagu owner , who opt for a rival bid on Jan. 12 . Mr. Iger franchis option were termin .Perhap the time wa simpli coincid . A person close to the board said that the collaps of the deal had noth to do with Mr. Iger evalu of Mr. Stagg , and that Mr. Iger becam involv with the N.F.L . out of a sens of civic duti . Had the bid succeed , it would have been at most a part-tim job .In ani event , in the follow week board discuss about Mr. Staggs futur intensifi . Unknown to Mr. Stagg , some on the board had resist name him chief oper offic the year befor , but Mr. Iger had prevail . Those reserv surfac again period , focus on whether Mr. Stagg wa the ideal person to lead Disney over the next 10 year , a period like to take the compani into the unchart water of the continu digit revolut and the post-cabl era .In mid-March , Mr. Iger summon Mr. Stagg to hi offic and drop a bombshel : Mr. Stagg lack the full confid of both Mr. Iger and the Disney board , which had been discuss Mr. Staggs perform at recent board meet . Mr. Iger told him Disney wa go to broaden it search for hi successor .Mr. Iger didnt say explicitli that Mr. Stagg wa out of the run , but the messag wa clear . Mr. Iger made no effort to persuad Mr. Stagg to stay . He offer no specif critic , accord to a person close to Mr. Stagg , who spoke on the condit of anonym becaus he wa not author to disclos compani matter publicli . Instead , Mr. Iger offer onli a vagu refer to Mr. Staggs lack of vision .( Both Mr. Stagg and Mr. Iger declin to comment for thi column . )The next week both men were away , spend spring break with their famili . After they return , they discuss the term and time of Mr. Staggs departur , which they decid would be announc thi past Monday . In make the announc , Mr. Iger prais Mr. Staggs contribut and call him a great friend.Mr. Stagg ha been publicli graciou . He said it had been a privilege to work at Disney , and he and Mr. Iger had lunch on Tuesday in the rotunda of the Disney headquart cafeteria , where they were visibl to mani employe .Within the rank of Disney , where Mr. Stagg continu to be wide admir , there wa widespread shock . Everybodi on Wall Street love Tom ,  said Doug Creutz , senior media and entertain analyst for Cowen & Compani .Mr. Staggs contract provid for a six-month period as a consult . He will not be present on June 16 for the gala open of the Shanghai Disneyland Resort in China , hi signatur achiev dure hi tenur at Disney .No one is perfect , and Mr. Iger may well have develop reserv about Mr. Stagg over the past year . But whatev hi and the board motiv in orchestr Mr. Staggs departur , one thing is clear : Mr. Iger is now indispens at Disney .For longtim Disney employe and observ , the situat is all too familiar . Among Mr. Eisner heir appar wa Jeffrey Katzenberg , who left to found the rival studio DreamWork after Mr. Eisner famous reneg on a promis to make him presid .Michael Ovitz , the superag who wa at the time Mr. Eisner best friend , last less than a year as presid befor Mr. Eisner undermin him and then had him fire . Press by the board to name a successor , Mr. Eisner cite the entertain execut Barri Diller , but then wrote a confidenti letter to the board say that the fact he is a homosexu should have no weight ,  which , at the time , all but guarante Mr. Diller would never succeed him .Mr. Eisner wa in the midst of undermin Mr. Iger , tell board member he lack statur ,  when a sharehold revolt led by Roy E. Disney , Walt nephew , forc Mr. Eisner resign .While more fact may emerg , what is known so far i fulli consist with Mr. Iger want to remain as chief execut ,  Professor Larcker said . There a long histori in busi of pick a successor and then discredit them.Disney insist that the decis had noth to do with Mr. Iger want to extend hi tenur . Given hi superb track record at Disney , he could sure stay as long as he want . Unlik the situat when Mr. Eisner left , Disney is by no mean in crisi . The anim unit , film oper and theme park , in particular , seem to be fire on all cylind .But the person who ha close tie to the board told me that board member have been keenli interest in success and , given Disney histori , veri awar of the peril of a chief execut who stay too long . With Mr. Stagg gone , and no other obviou candid to take hi place , the board may have littl choic but to beg Mr. Iger to stay .If your a Disney board member , your workload ha just gone up a lot and your go to get a lot of scrutini ,  Professor Larcker said . Now they have to get someon better than Stagg .

How do you reconcil the Second Circuit languag about a meaning close person relationship with other languag that suggest just intend to benefit somebodi might count in certain circumst ? Justic Scalia death may affect the outcom becaus he had express skeptic about insid trade sinc it wa larg a product of judge-mad law rather than legisl . Hi approach of appli a narrow read to crimin prohibit will be miss when the court decid what must be shown to prove a tip violat .Look beyond Salman is the question of whether Congress will final step forward to defin what constitut insid trade .

If they do , I think they will screw it up and we will have a wors situat than we do now.With the law of insid trade in flux , both the govern and defens lawyer have to deal with the uncertainti in the hope that the Suprem Court can provid some clariti when it decid the Salman case .Pleas take a moment to listen to thi audio White Collar Watch to hear how two experienc secur litig view the state of the law .', 'Ten year ago last March , Amazon start the era of rent data storag and comput over the Internet , what is now known as cloud comput .

The remodel market tend to follow the hous market ,  she said .Seller spend on renov project to help make their home more attract to potenti buyer , and buyer also spend on upgrad after they purchas a home , Ms. Will said , to make the hous better fit their need .By the end of thi year , the program index of spend on home improv , known as the LIRA , for lead indic of remodel activ , is expect to surpass the previou peak , set in 2006 befor the hous downturn .About 36 million peopl , or more than a quarter of homeown in the Unit State , are expect to make upgrad to their properti in the come year , accord to a survey out thi week from Bankrat . ( The telephon survey of 1,000 adult wa conduct in March by Princeton Survey Research Associ . The margin of sampl error is plu or minu 4 percentag point . )The most popular option , the survey found , are fix to a home exterior or yard renov , includ driveway , deck , patio , landscap or fenc , follow by updat like new floor and window , roof or side .Homeown may find , howev , that get financ for renov still isnt quit as easi as it wa befor the hous downturn , when mani peopl borrow against their home equiti  the differ between their home valu and their mortgag . While mani hous market have recov , some still havent made up for the loss of home equiti that occur in the hous debacl .Typic , bank look for equiti of at least 20 percent when consid home equiti loan or line of credit to fund renov , said Mike Cetera , person loan and credit analyst for Bankrat . Bank are just start to loosen the purs string ,  he said .Brendan Coughlin , head of consum lend at Citizen Bank , said the bank ha seen applic for home equiti line of credit increas by about 30 percent a year over the last two year . In part , the increas is becaus of refinanc of credit line that were taken out 10 year ago and are now reset to higher monthli payment . ( Line of credit typic requir interest-onli payment for 10 year , and then shift to interest plu princip payment for anoth 10 to 20 year . )But roughli half of the demand is from new borrow who are feel more confid about take on debt and are seek to use the equiti in their home for project like signific home remodel , he said . Unlik befor the econom downturn , when homeown use their home equiti to financ vacat and luxuri item , today borrow are not use their home as all-purpos piggi bank , he said . There definit a huge trend toward respons borrow ,  he said .If you qualifi , a home-equ loan or line of credit is gener the most afford financ option . Interest rate will usual be lower sinc the loan is secur with your home as the collater .Borrow gener need strong credit to get the best rate . Fifth Third Bank , for instanc , is promot introductori teaser rate as low as 1.99 percent on home equiti line of credit for borrow with credit score of 750 or higher .If you dont qualifi , there are more option avail now for person loan  unsecur loan made for a varieti of purpos . Rate may be higher , sinc the loan are unsecur . But for borrow with excel credit , onlin lender like LightStream , an arm of SunTrust Bank , are offer person loan for home remodel with rate as low as 3.99 percent . ( Often , such lender offer the lowest rate onli if the borrow agre to have payment automat deduct from their bank account . )With a person loan , if you run into troubl  say , lose your job  and cant pay back the loan , youll hurt your credit rate and you may be hound by debt collector , but you wont lose your home , Mr. Cetera note .He caution , howev , that most person loan are for shorter period of time , typic three year . So borrow need to consid how quickli they can pay back the debt .If you have good credit and the amount need for a renov is rel small , he said , a zero-interest credit card may be an option . Just be sure you can repay the debt befor the introductori zero-perc period expir , which is often within 12 to 18 month , or youll be hit with double-digit interest rate .Or you could just pay for the project out of save . Research last year by Piper Jaffray on home improv found that 70 percent or more of homeown plan to pay for major remodel at least partli with cash .Here are some question and answer about home renov : Will renov increas the valu of my properti ?That depend . Befor decid on a project , it wise to consid how much you can recoup when you sell the hous . Not all project add equal valu at resal time , if you are plan on sell in the near term , accord to an analysi from Remodel magazin . The report suggest that more function improv , like a new roof , can provid a bigger return than an elabor kitchen remodel . Ad fiberglass insul in your attic , for instanc , return about 116 percent on averag , while you may recoup just 65 percent of the cost of a full kitchen remodel . Will there be enough worker to meet the increas demand for renov ?After the hous crash , mani skill construct worker left the residenti construct industri , and the labor pool for remodel work probabl ha been affect , too , Ms. Will said . Homeown , she said , should expect that renov project will take longer to schedul and complet than they did befor the hous downturn . Is the interest on a home improv loan tax-deduct ?The interest paid on loan secur by your main home , like a mortgag or a home-equ loan , is usual tax deduct . Gener , interest on person loan and other type of unsecur debt , like credit card debt , cant be deduct on your incom tax return .', 'Youv heard of the American dream , right ?

New unemploy data on Friday show that the eurozon jobless rate , while edg down slightli , remain abov 10 percent  more than twice the level in the Unit State .It almost a lost decad ,  said Joseph Stiglitz , the Nobel laureat economist and a professor at Columbia Univers . It a remark testimoni to the econom failur of the euro and the eurozone.The strongest economi in the eurozon  major export like Germani and the Netherland  have recov more handili . But in the worst-hit countri  Cypru , Greec , Ireland and Itali  ordinari peopl continu to grappl with the consequ of deep job loss and wage cut , which have slash incom .In Itali , dispos incom for the averag household  essenti , take-hom pay  shrank 4 percent from 2008 to 2014 , accord to European Union data . Over those year , Greek household lost 24 percent of their dispos incom , and Cypru suffer declin of 22 percent . At the same time , German household gain more than 15 percent .So much time ha pass with overal European fortun frozen or even slide backward that doubt pervad about the abil of the Contin to ever again achiev sustain robust growth .

Major bank across the Contin remain reluct to lend , starv even healthi busi of capit need to expand and hire . Concern about the global economi  especi the slowdown in China  threaten to crimp Europe export growth , which ha been at the center of the recoveri .To be sure , Friday preliminari data  a new early-stag snapshot of growth releas by the European Union  show the eurozon advanc dure the first quarter at a stronger pace than the Unit State economi , which manag onli a 0.5 percent annual rate in the same period .But cloud the eurozon growth data wa anoth new figur on Friday , indic that consum price in the currenc union were down 0.2 percent in April .

There , a real estat bubbl in the 1980 gave way to a calamit bust that left bank reel . Decad of half-measur aim at finess the economi to better day kept the ship of state afloat but left it in the doldrum .Europ is just sort of hang on ,  said Kenneth Rogoff , a former chief economist at the Intern Monetari Fund who is a professor at Harvard . It veri much like Japan , where Japan chose not to grab the bull by the horn . It still a veri rich countri . It stabl , but it in decline.Even hang on may amount to an aspir .

If they opt for a so-cal Brexit  and poll have shown the number are close  that will initi a two-year period in which leader in London and Brussel will need to negoti a divorc .No one realli know what will happen then , but a host of research institut have issu report warn of econom cost should a split ensu .

By late 2011 , less than four year after the downturn began , G.D.P . wa back to it precrisi level , reach $ 15 trillion .The eurozon , which gener 2.48 trillion in econom activ dure the first quarter , is onli now on track to surpass it 2008 full-year gross domest product . of just below 10 trillion , or about $ 11.3 trillion .It ha been hobbl by the basic afflict of it peculiar setup : The euro currenc is a share enterpris , yet the 19 nation govern that now use it oper their own budget , while have to abid by limit on borrow .In other countri , econom weak gener push down the valu of the currenc , make good cheaper on world market rel to competitors and lift export . But in the eurozon , all the countri are stuck with the same valu for their currenc , regardless of their individu troubl .The crisi began in the Unit State , yet the rigid associ with the euro meant that it wa the eurozon that wound up the big loser ,  Mr. Stiglitz said . It worth note that , over that period , Japan , the rest of Europ and the Unit State all perform better . Thi is a euro disease.Germani , which play the domin role in set eurozon econom polici , ha been unwil to allow nation govern to run larger deficit to stimul their economi , while demand that they enact polici that make it easier for employ to hire and fire . The result ha been Continentwid auster marin in acrimoni .The French and Italian have been shout at the German , You should expand and then well all be better off ,  Mr. Begg said . The German have been shout back , No , you should sort out your mess and then well all grow together.The eurozon economi ha made progress sinc the crisi hit , even if it size is roughli the same . Eight year ago , financ and construct made up a greater share of the economi than today , a remind of the overbuild that left bank talli disastr lend loss . Now , export are more pronounc , a trend enhanc by the declin of the euro , which ha surrend 28 percent of it valu against the dollar sinc the summer of 2008 . Thi ha made European good cheaper on world market .But the abil of European busi to continu to rack up export growth face challeng . China , the European Union second-largest trade partner behind the Unit State , absorb roughli 10 percent of Europe export ware last year , accord to the bloc data . As China slow , that will most like diminish it appetit for Europe product .There isnt much help for the eurozon in the broader global economi ,  said Jacob Kirkegaard , a senior fellow at the Peterson Institut for Intern Econom in Washington .Beyond the worri of the moment , a rapidli age popul appear veri like to constrain Europe fortun . While Europe high level of product should continu to support a comfort standard of live and a strong social safeti net for much of it popul , fewer peopl work mean fewer good be produc and servic render .The potenti growth rate in Europ is probabl 1 percent ,  Mr. Kirkegaard ad . We shouldnt therefor expect growth to be much greater than it is today .

At the La Vega meet , Volkswagen execut promis to provid dealer with more non-diesel car to sell thi year and to price it vehicl lower to sell in higher volum than in the past .It is vital the dealer network settl thi issu in a unifi manner ,  Mr. Brown said . Most dealer want a strong work relationship with our partner long after thi issu is resolved.The sale drop ha been steep for Volkswagen-brand car , as well as for Bentley and Lamborghini , which are also own by the Volkswagen Group . In the first three month of thi year , Volkswagen-brand sale declin 12.5 percent to 69,314 car and light truck .

The victim famili , which ha own the car for about five year , said it receiv no recal notic , local investig said .The victim , Huma Hanif , 17 , wa drive on a state highway outsid Houston around 4:30 p.m. on March 31 when she ran into the car in front of her , accord to Bob Haenel , an offic at the Fort Bend Counti Sheriff Offic .Ms. Hanif airbag ruptur , send a metal fragment into the side of her neck , said Danni Beckworth , a lead investig in the case . She die at the scene , about a seven-minut drive away from Georg Ranch High School , where she wa a student .She wasnt speed . The car had onli moder damag ,  Mr. Beckworth said . It a crash that we work with everi day that everybodi walk away from.Takata defect airbag have led to a larg and complex safeti recal . Fourteen automak have recal 28 million airbag inflat , the metal case that contain the propel , in about 24 million vehicl . But million more vehicl with Takata-mad airbag inflat have not yet been recal .The propel , call ammonium nitrat , can becom unstabl over time or when it is expos to moistur . The safeti agenc ha bar Takata from use ammonium nitrat for new order , but ha given it until the end of 2018 to prove that the compound is safe in inflat that remain on the road .In a statement , Honda confirm a death in Texa by a ruptur Takata inflat , but gave no detail . It said it thought and deepest sympathies were with the driver famili .Takata said in a statement that it wa deepli sorri for all fatal and injuri that have occur in ani case where a Takata airbag inflat ha fail to deploy as intended.Honda said that Ms. Hanif 2002 Civic wa a use vehicl and had been recal multipl time sinc 2011 . It said notic were sent out to it regist owner , includ to the current owner , a member of Ms. Hanif famili .The 2002 Civic wa first recal by Honda in April 2011 , and at least three time sinc then , to fix both the driver and passenger side airbag , accord to the feder safeti agency databas .Still , the famili ha told investig that it did not receiv ani recal notic , Mr. Beckworth said . He said polic were look into the discrep .It wa unclear whether the car had alreadi been recal when the Hanif famili acquir the car . The Unit State doe not requir the repair of use vehicl that have been recal for safeti issu befor they are sold .That will chang in June , when a feder law take effect prohibit rental car compani from rent recal vehicl that have not been repair . That law doe not appli to used-car dealer , though other statut on unfair and decept practic afford buyer of use car some protect .Honda inspect Ms. Hanif vehicl earlier Wednesday togeth with repres of the Nation Highway Traffic Safeti Administr , the sheriff depart and Takata .It said it had share inform on the vehicle histori with the safeti agenc and would cooper with continu investig into the crash .As the recal of Takata airbag have mushroom and death have mount in recent year , the speed of the repair ha becom an increas sourc of concern among lawmak and regul . Ten of the 11 death have been in the Unit State .Honda on Wednesday continu to urg owner of recal car to take their vehicl for repair .But regul said that a more aggress outreach to owner wa need . The convent approach to recal notif alon is inadequ ,  the feder auto safeti agenc said in a statement . It would renew it call to the automak involv to intensifi and expand their outreach to affect vehicl owners.Mani replac part , though , remain unavail , Honda said . Although a replac wa avail for Ms. Hanif car , Honda said , they are still not avail for the newest round of recal that the automak announc in Februari . Auto safeti offici have urg car owner to check the recal statu of their car .Senat Bill Nelson , Democrat of Florida , said in a statement that the death show that current recal effort were fall short .Takata and the automak have to step up their effort to locat , notifi and fix everi impact car as soon as possibl  befor anyon els die ,  he said .', 'In Silicon Valley , hedg fund with billion-dollar reserv are becom the new ventur capitalist .Tiger Global , a $ 20 billion invest firm start by Chase Coleman as a hedg fund , is one of three investor that ha help Nubank , a digit financ compani in Brazil , rais ten of million of dollar .Lee Ainslie $ 10.5 billion hedg fund , Maverick Capit , is likewis dabbl in privat start-up fund , as one of three investor in Vserv , a digit platform for mobil market and commerc in India and Southeast Asia that ha rais more than $ 10 million .Lend Club , an onlin marketplac that match peopl who want to borrow money with peopl will to lend it to them , count Coatu Manag , a hedg fund and privat equiti fund , as one of it investor befor it initi public offer in late 2014 .All three hedg fund have someth els in common : They are part of a success network of so-cal Tiger cub , manag that got their start from the billionair trader Julian Robertson , who made hi mark pick stock . Hi Tiger cub have also struck gold .

The initi flood of money into Silicon Valley fintech start-up from hedg fund start two year earlier and wa focus on marketplac lend .

Fintech ha been one of the shiniest object around in recent year .

The propos ha been contenti on the island , where the governor and hi top advis are increasingli at odd with investor over how to restructur the debt , most of it in the form of municip bond .Thi legisl provid us with the tool to address the highest prioriti of need  provid essenti servic to our peopl  without fear of retribut ,  the governor said in a statement on Wednesday . He accus Puerto Rico creditor of hamper feder assist by misinform the public and dissuad Congress from do what is right for our 3.5 million American citizens.The Puerto Rican Senat approv the measur at about 3 a.m. Tuesday . The Hous , after becom embroil in a disput over whether certain type of bond should be exclud , approv it around 1 a.m. Wednesday .Stephen Spencer , who repres some investor who have alreadi agre to restructur their bond , said , We intend to care review the legisl , but at thi stage we believ that it may lead to violat of the term of the agreement.He said that the administr last fall had hail that restructur as a model for other to follow , ad that the bondhold he repres should have been exclud from ani come moratorium , rather than be cast into a state of uncertainty.The bill did not specifi a start date for a moratorium , leav that decis to the governor . But a big debt payment , $ 422 million , is due on May 1 , and there have been mani sign that Puerto Rico is not abl or will to pay it .That payment is due on bond issu by the Govern Develop Bank , an institut that play a critic role in the island financi affair , includ hold deposit of municip and other govern entiti . As recent as last week , holder of the bank debt were in talk about an agreement that would give the bank some breath room if it fail to make the payment .But those effort broke off in the face of a flurri of revel that the bank wa insolv , that it might be place in receivership , and that it wa swiftli move deposit to other financi institut , appar to keep them from be frozen or drain away by frighten depositor .The bill say the bank ha just $ 562 million in cash . A moratorium would be intend , among other thing , to help preserv that cash , so the bank can use it to financ the activ of other part of the govern .The law also establish a new framework for put the develop bank into receivership , and creat a bridg bank that would take over some of it deposit and oblig dure the moratorium .', 'Bank ha long been view as one of the last tradit , old-school , stuck-in-the-past industri . When you think of bank , you might still think of wood-panel wall and pinstrip suit .That impress may increasingli be misguid .If you spend more than 15 minut with ani senior execut of a larg bank these day , it is almost imposs not to hear the phrase fintech utter . It is usual spoken with a sens of optim , but sometim with a sens of dread .Fintech ,  of cours , is short for financi technolog , a catchal for a near-revolut of new technolog aim at upend part of the financi world , includ payment , wealth manag , lend , insur and currenc .The fintech phrase itself is actual not new  it date to the late 1980 and earli 1990  though it ha taken on a heighten sens of import and urgenc now that it ha been embrac by Silicon Valley as the new new thing .

Wealthfront want to advis you and manag your money from your phone . And , of cours , Bitcoin and it mani deriv want to be the new gold , or better yet , digit cash .If they succeed , Wall Street as we know it may becom an outpost of Palo Alto .

If all the current manual process can be replac by autom , these job can disappear or evolve.The rippl effect are enorm : Consid not just the employe but the impact on commerci real estat , for exampl , if bank shut their covet branch on the corner in major citi .Other are less convinc . Wall Street denizen like the bank investor J. Christoph Flower have declar that the fintech frenzi is simpli that : hype that defi common sens and will leav a trail of fail compani in it wake .A third view may have the highest likelihood of come true : The big bank , so power and yet so anxiou about the possibl of be disrupt by the upstart , will gobbl them all up in a spate of merger and acquisit that put the disrupt squar insid the institut they were suppos to overtak .Wit JPMorgan Chase recent allianc with OnDeck , an onlin lend platform for small busi .

Silicon Valley ha long shun regul industri , but have conquer so much of the landscap in other industri , it is now turn to financ .The Offic of the Comptrol of the Currenc recent said it thought a new regulatori framework need to be creat to help foster innov among fintech compani while ensur complianc .Given that the 2008 financi crisi is still so fresh , it is hard to see the rule loosen too much .Which perhap may be the most compel reason for whi there is probabl go to be a wave of deal among these compani soon .

Ryan instruct lawmak to find a respons solution to Puerto Rico debt crisi in the first three month of thi year , give the island plenti of time to prepar for a May 1 deadlin on a $ 422 million debt payment .So much for that .That deadlin is immin , but Republican in the Hous and Democrat in the administr are still haggl over the term of a bill to rescu Puerto Rico . Miss the payment risk further destabil it shrunken economi . And there are concern that the passag of ani legisl could be delay until the island near the tip point of it debt woe : a $ 2 billion debt payment due on Juli 1 .The May 1 payment consist mainli of princip and interest due from Puerto Rico Govern Develop Bank , a uniqu power institut that ha play a lead role in the island borrow and financi affair for decad . It activ are so numer and critic that analyst have worri for month that the bank failur would have untold rippl effect across the island . Puerto Rico governor , Alejandro Garca Padilla , who ha warn about default for month , ha express frustrat with Washington inabl to act quickli .On Monday there will be a default ,  he said on Wednesday . The bank ha until the close of busi on Monday , sinc the May 1 due date fall on a Sunday .But the bigger issu may be that second , larger debt bill due in Juli , roughli $ 800 million of which is constitut guarante , give the payment of it legal prioriti even over the fund of essenti public servic , such as polic patrol , ambul or drink water . Investor who hold the guarante debt say they are prepar to fight to enforc their legal right , no matter how much it may shock and anger the island resid .There too much discord ,  said Matt Fabian , a manag director at Municip Market Analyt , refer to the rancor over the rescu bill . Thi wa suppos to be a veri control process , and it just got out of hand.When Mr. Ryan order debt relief for Puerto Rico , he may not have known just how intract the differ were go to be  not onli between Democrat and Republican , but also among certain class of creditor , some of whom are intent on avoid the sort of loss that Detroit bondhold were forc to bear after that citi went bankrupt in 2013 .In addit to lobbi Congress , some of the bondhold are sponsor televis ad that depict the rescu of Puerto Rico as an odiou taxpay bailout . And some other creditor are in quiet talk with repres of the Puerto Rican govern , test the water for a sweep negoti debt reduct that might obviat congression action .Despit the power and import of the Govern Develop Bank , it debt are not back by ani tax power or constitut guarante . If it default on the loom $ 422 million payment , it creditor have littl legal recours . And much of the bank debt , in the form of municip bond , is held by more than 100 credit union on the island  financi institut that tend to serv mom-and-pop saver in Puerto Rico poor and remot commun .The island credit union repres the nest egg of nearli 1,000,000 Puerto Rican famili ( one of everi four Puerto Rican ) that trust their livelihood and save in these financi institut ,  said the credit unions primari regul in a statement releas last year , when the sector held Govern Develop Bank debt with a face valu of slightli more than $ 500 million , accord to regulatori record . The regulator spokesman did not answer messag Thursday .Histor , the credit union were requir to invest onli in veri safe asset . But in 2009 their regul made an except , allow them to buy and hold riskier bond , as long as the bond were issu by some branch of the Puerto Rican govern . The chang gave the Govern Develop Bank a new way to rais money , by sell it bond to the credit union .As a result , those institut wound up with outsiz exposur to the bank , which itself wa found insolv last year by Puerto Rico Commission of Financi Institut . Offici on the island have been seek a way to protect the credit union from the bank expect default , but it is not clear what the mechan would be , or whether it could even be put in place in time .A payment default by the Govern Develop Bank would add to the list of extrem measur that Puerto Rico ha undertaken to stretch it dwindl cash while wait for Congress to enact it rescu packag .

And the biggest money manag in the world , includ BlackRock , now regularli incorpor ESG analysi as they compos their portfolio .The motiv is not entir about ethic . Underpin the strategi is a belief that compani that take better care of the environ and their commun will perform better in the long run .No one want to be patron with a moral argument ,  said Andrea Feiner , head of ESG research at Arabesqu . You tell investor that these compani are go to perform better.And yet even among the most strident capitalist , there is a grow sens that do well by do good is in vogu .We have the opportun to marri make money with a purpos ,  Mr. Feiner said . That is a veri rare thing in finance.What make the Arabesqu posit in Cracker Barrel all the more surpris is that it wasnt a fund manag who made the decis to invest . It wa an algorithm .Arabesqu bill itself as the first firm exclus focus on ESG invest through quantit analysi  that is , with algorithm , rather than human , pick the stock . It ha two fund , with about $ 50 million under manag . It Prime fund is fulli invest in equiti and rebalanc quarterli , while it Systemat fund move money to cash hold dure period of market volatil and is rebalanc daili .To make these decis , Arabesque technolog reli on an expand univers of data concern the ESG perform of thousand of compani . Among the biggest supplier of such inform are Bloomberg , Sustainalyt and MSCI . Bloomberg said that about 15,000 of it custom regularli access the ESG data it provid through it termin .To compil the data , firm like Bloomberg mine regulatori file , compani sustain report and websit to find seemingli obscur inform , such as how much nitrou oxid a manufactur emit each year , how mani employe die on the job , and how mani women are in manag posit .Onc firm like Arabesqu get their hand on the data , they add it to their algorithm and place their faith  and fund  in the wisdom of the machin .Arabesqu ha gone further than most , turn over the entir composit of it fund to algorithm rather than to human .

Take climat chang . It veri clear that that manifest itself in physic risk , in all sort of thing . That wa not someth that we were think about in the 20th century.BNi Mellon scoop up data from Bloomberg and Sustainalyt , as well as RepRisk , which doe broad ESG analysi ; CDP , which focus on carbon emiss ; and Institut Sharehold Servic , a corpor govern specialist .About 15 year ago , the account scandal at Enron and WorldCom began to focu investors attent on the import of corpor govern . After that , investor began to wonder if environment and social factor should be on their radar , too .The door open a crack so you could have a convers about the possibl of these thing ,  said Michael Jantzi , chief execut of Sustainalyt , one of the main provid of ESG data .Now there is littl doubt that ESG issu can have meaning effect on stock .

Investor are go to start to differenti technolog compani that are in financ from financi servic compani that are use technology.Some of that will stem from what is in their public file . Technolog compani are often character by have simpl balanc sheet , fast revenu growth and high oper margin .

You could be pay a fee of over 1 percent in your 401 ( k )  while the person next to you could be pay 10 time less.While Mr. Smith earnest , somewhat preachi demeanor ha not chang much , what and to whom he sell certainli ha . No longer doe he travel the world , promot complex deriv bet to some of the sharpest investor around .Instead , here he wa in thi citi tri to persuad a skeptic audienc of middl manag at a credit union to hand over the key to their 401 ( k ) plan to Blooom , the financi start-up he join a year ago .Over the span of your work life , you could save more than $ 100,000 by pay less in fee , Mr. Smith promis , stride back and forth in the sun-fil confer hall at the corpor headquart of Mazuma Credit Union , which serv five counti in Kansa and Missouri .It a no brainer ,  he said .Mr. Smith is far from the onli person from an entrench Wall Street firm to flee to the Wild West of new financi technolog compani .But few have left with as much theatric flair as Mr. Smith . Have known him befor he made hi big splash , I wa curiou about how he wa manag hi post-Goldman life and went to thi citi to see for myself .In hi spiel to Mazuma , Mr. Smith did not say that mutual fund compani were treat 401 ( k ) saver like muppet , but he might as well have .After all , the essenc of Mr. Smith origin complaint wa that Goldman Sach , in pursuit of quick and easi profit , had come to regard it everyday client as a readi mark . An idiot and fool to be manipul by someon els , wa how Mr. Smith describ the sentiment in the book he subsequ wrote , Whi I Left Goldman Sachs.On Goldman trade floor in London , where Mr. Smith work when he resign in 2012 , these unsuspect client were frequent refer to as muppet , Mr. Smith claim .And with that revel , he turn an obscur bit of trader slang into a global symbol for the mani who believ that Goldman wa put the company financi interest ahead of it partner in busi .Goldman Sach reject the notion . But even among the mani who believ that the compani had becom short-term greedi , there were those who view Mr. Smith critiqu as bitter and self-serv .Inde , when the book came out , review snif , and sale were mediocr at best .Soon , peopl had stop talk about muppet and Greg Smith altogeth .For a while , in 2013 and 2014 , Mr. Smith wa not sure what to do next .Mi parent want me to get a job ,  Mr. Smith said as he drank a beer at a hotel bar here .He spent some time in Washington , advis the Democrat Senat Carl Levin of Michigan and Jeff Merkley of Oregon on regulatori issu connect to Dodd-Frank legisl .And he hit the paid speech circuit , although it becam clear that a career as a public advoc for proper financi and fiduciari practic wa not go to happen .Then Mr. Smith came upon the notion of champion the right of the 90 million American who have around $ 7 trillion save in 401 ( k ) retir plan through their compani .The pool of money wa huge , but with the averag plan size about $ 91,000 , Mr. Smith saw these saver as get short shrift from the mutual fund giant and the compani that sponsor the plan .That these mostli unsophist saver end up in higher-fe or higher-risk fund without know ani better gall him , he said .In 2014 , he met Chri Costello , a former invest advis base here who had just co-found Blooom , a financi technolog start-up that use an algorithm to guid 401 ( k ) saver into the cheapest , most appropri fund avail to them .Mr. Smith wa impress and soon join as presid overse market and busi develop . He also came in as an investor , and just a few month ago , he pull up stake in New York and move here .Mr. Smith , 37 , grew up in Johannesburg , went to Stanford and spent 12 year work for Goldman in New York and London .But there is someth unjad , if not cornf , about him that make him a perfect fit for Kansa .At Blooom offic on the city outskirt , rock tune fill the air , quant  the math wizard wear Royal basebal cap  pound away at their comput keyboard and a beer tap and Ping-Pong tabl stand at the readi .Sit in a confer room , Mr. Smith cite a strike statist while explain whi he is convinc that Blooom , whose asset have grown to $ 225 million from $ 54 million over the last year , can hit it big .Of the 90 million peopl who have 401 ( k ) plan , more than 83 million will simpli guess randomli when it come to select the fund that a Vanguard or a Fidel offer them , he point out .The differ between pick a high- or low-fe fund could add two to three year to your retir ,  Mr. Smith said .When I told him that I count myself in the camp of 401 ( k ) guesser and wa curiou to see what Blooom could do for my sad littl retir plan , he respond enthusiast .Great idea ! Let do it , man ,  he said .So I did what 2,300 client have done befor me : I hand over the password to my Vanguard retir account , paid Blooom a Netflix-styl fee of $ 15 a month and got out of the way .Mr. Smith gave me the news with a sympathet shake of hi head : 28 percent of my portfolio wa earn next to zero in a pricey bond fund , and I had no intern exposur .Moreov , the fund that I blindli select when I sign up for my plan 15 year ago charg me 0.51 percent in fee .Within minut , the algorithm had done it work , put 98 percent of my portfolio into a mix of global diversifi stock fund , with the rest go to bond .But what realli got Mr. Smith go were the save come my way .Look , man ,  he said , point hi finger excitedli at the flower in full bloom on my comput screen . Your fee are now 0.20  that is an annual save of $ 775 a year.It too soon to tell whether these kind of robo-invest oper will serv investor well over the long term , or whether Blooom will surviv in the harshli competit world of financ .But thi much is also true : When I left Blooom that day , no one could say I wa a muppet .', 'Sammi Yuen , a graphic design who live on the Upper West Side of Manhattan , wa stand in line at Whole Food Market one morn wait to pay . He use the Starbuck app on hi phone to order coffe in advanc and then bought hi Whole Food item with Appl Pay by hold the phone in front of the regist .Use hi phone in these way ha becom a routin for Mr. Yuen . Wherev I can use it , I do use it ,  he said .But Mr. Yuen is veri much the except .Bank , technolog compani and retail are spend larg sum to build system and app so that peopl can pay for item with their phone in store , where most retail spend still take place . The hope is that phone will make payment more effici and give bank and retail new data on their customers shop habit . Phone and softwar maker , includ Appl , Googl and Samsung , are get involv in mobil payment to make their product more use and attract to their owner .Behind all thi is the belief that consum will discov the benefit of pay with their phone  and then use them more often as a payment method .Yet thi is happen slowli .A tini percentag of in-stor sale are made with phone . In the Unit State , an estim $ 8.7 billion in purchas were made with phone in 2015 , accord to a survey by eMarket , a research firm . That is a mere 0.2 percent of the estim $ 4.35 trillion of in-stor sale last year . Exclud purchas made with a wildli popular app by Starbuck , the amount of mobil payment would most like be well below that $ 8.7 billion , payment industri expert say .Other custom come out of Whole Food that morn gave sever reason for not pay with their phone . Most were concern about the secur of the transact  or of lose their phone and have other peopl get access to their financi data .They also doubt phone were much faster than credit or debit card . Even Mr. Yuen said , I still think that swipe is faster.And peopl who activ a payment method like Appl Pay may not use it much . Onli 15 percent of peopl who had tri it said they use the servic more than onc a month , accord to a survey in Januari by First Annapoli , an electron payment consult and research firm .Appl said the usag of Appl Pay acceler significantli in the second half of 2015 , compar with the first half of that year . The compani did not defin how it wa measur usag .Larg number of consum dont appear to be make frequent use of the other payment app , either . Part of the problem may be that mani app are simultan vy for consumers attent , keep one from becom domin , at least for now .Confront by the low enthusiasm for mobil payment , compani are look for way to gener some excit .Samsung ha taken a technolog step that substanti increas the number of place where it servic , Samsung Pay , can be use . Mani phone payment method requir the technolog near-field commun . But it doe not exist on older payment termin that read a card magnet strip . Samsung Pay , howev , can be use on both type of termin . Rival mobil payment servic from Appl and Android do not work on the older technolog .As a result , Samsung Pay can be use in more place , accord to Thoma Ko , Samsung Pay global co-gener manag . Truli , you dont have to carri your wallet anymor ,  he said .But that advantag may not last , as the number of near-field commun termin grow .Compani might also tri to increas adopt by underscor the way in which pay by phone can be more secur than use a card . Thumbprint authent and passcod can make it almost imposs for a thief to use a stolen phone to pay for someth .By contrast , a stolen credit card , or inform from the card , can be easili misus until the theft is suspect or report .Servic like Android Pay , Appl Pay and Samsung Pay use technolog that allow the phone to make a credit card payment without transmit the card detail into the store payment system . Thi make such servic safer than , say , a card swipe , in which the card number enter the store system and can be vulner to hacker .But becaus card user gener do not have to pay fraudul charg , the more secur natur of phone may not ultim be the big draw that lead consum to use them more for payment .Anoth way to increas use might be to make pay with a phone far quicker than use a card . Servic like Appl Pay are design to be fast . But at some store , the custom still ha to sign when use such servic . And even when that isnt the case , take out a phone and make a payment is probabl not that much faster than use a card .Mani payment specialist say they believ that for mobil payment system to take off , they have to reduc cost for retail . See the save , retail may then offer their custom benefit for use their phone to pay , like reward program . Such a program ha been one reason for the runaway popular of the Starbuck payment app . And onc consum see real benefit from pay with their phone , they may final turn to their phone a lot more at the checkout .That is whi mani payment expert are wait to see what happen with JPMorgan Chase digit wallet , call Chase Pay , which the bank aim to offer thi year . JPMorgan ha payment relationship with a wide rang of merchant , which , the bank hope , will give Chase Pay critic mass with both retail and custom .Still , shoppers infrequ use of mobil payment doe not bode well . Credit and debit card have drawback , but are easi to carri and gener quick to use . What more , they dont have batteri that run out dure a shop trip . What happen if my phone die ?  said Tyriek Good , a resid of Harlem , as he came out of Whole Food last month . I dont want to get use to this.', 'Financ is where they built their career .

In the 12 month sinc , the smartwatch ha receiv mix review , and mani peopl are still uncertain about what the devic can do .The Appl Watch use , of cours , partli depend on the app avail for it . On that front , the news is good  the list of app for the watch is ever-grow . Here are some of the best one to tri .My favorit Appl Watch app is one of the simplest . It call Facer , and it doe one thing : It put a differ background imag on the screen of your watch everi time you rais it to see the time . Thi is weirdli reward . I love glanc down to see a new or interest imag when check the watch , and it remind me that thi devic realli is a piec of 21st-centuri technolog .There are a few limit to Facer . The biggest is that you are stuck with onli one watch face design  the simplest , which show onli an imag and the time . That mean you will not see featur like alert or weather inform that you can see on other watch face . You also have to pay for some of the imag , which can cost $ 1 and up .The most use watch app I have instal is Groceri Shop List Free  Buy Me a Pie ! , which work on both the watch and iPhon .The idea is that when you survey your shelv and refriger , you use the iPhon app to pull togeth a shop list . The app make thi easi , offer prearrang option for item you may regularli buy , like bread , milk , bagel and so on . You can color-cod each item to make identifi differ categori of product easi , and item the app doe not alreadi have can be type in . You can also set up multipl list , and share them with other .When shop , you can view your shop list on your watch , without have to fish out your phone . Thi is a fabul memori aid . Swipe the item on the watch screen to mark them as bought is satisfi . And you can use dictat on the watch to add item to a list , which is great when you suddenli rememb someth you need to buy .The app is easi to read and use . It is also free ( though with limit featur , and ad ) . A similar free app call Bring ! ha much the same util , but with more iconlik graphic and a slightli more modern user interfac . It good , but I prefer the simplic of Buy Me a Pie .Promot health and fit is a great use for the watch , and the $ 3 HeartWatch is particularli help . The app show your most recent heart rate read , as well as an indic of your averag heart rate and the maximum and minimum for that day .At a glanc thi can tell you if your heart ha been speed , which is use after a jog , for exampl . By use Forc Touch  press hard on the watch  you can add a note to that day read , or add a measur to your Appl Health app , includ weight , bodi temperatur and mani more .The accompani iPhon app is well design and can display lot of heart health statist , most of which are easili readabl thank to clever graphic . You can also use it to track your sleep habit .A better sleep track option , though , is the free Sleep++ . Thi work by measur your movement dure the night via your Appl Watch , give an indic of how restless you were .The app ha one button to turn the sleep-detect mode on , dure which it display your bedtim and how long you have been sleep . There is also a singl button to turn the sleep mode off , after which the app show some sleep statist . The accompani iPhon app display detail inform about sleep pattern .The one downsid of thi app is that the watch must be worn dure the night , which may be uncomfort for some .Cycl is anoth use free health app , deliv at-a-gl inform about a menstrual cycl . It accompani iPhon app let peopl log mani more detail and set up alert .Final mention go to the eye-pleas weather app Weather Underground , which I prefer to Apple own weather option ; Meetup , a great location-bas watch app that is good for meet like-mind peopl for work or for share pastim ; and Glyphica , a text-bas adventur like so mani classic adventur game that you can actual play on your watch . These are all free .Soni ha a new Android app , PlayStat Video , which let PlayStat owner stream to a phone or tablet film and show they have purchas or rent from the PlayStat store . It the first time thi sort of servic ha been avail on Android proper . PlayStat Video is free .', 'Pfizer abandon deal leav all side taint .The Unit State Treasuri look bad for chang the rule on Monday to kill the $ 152 billion merger with Allergan .

Offici still see more reason to worri about rais rate too quickli than reason to worri about wait , accord to an offici account of the March polici meet , which the Fed publish on Wednesday .Inde , sever offici at the March meet said they were alreadi lean against a rate increas in April becaus that would signal a sens of urgenc they did not think appropriate.A week ago , Janet L. Yellen , the Fed chairwoman , emphas the need for patienc , and offici at the come meet are like to cement expect that the Fed policy-mak committe , the Feder Open Market Committe , will not serious consid rais interest rate until June .Yet the account also describ signific divis among the 17 offici on the committe regard basic issu , like the strength of inflat and the risk weak global growth pose to the domest economi .Some offici continu to push for a faster pace of rate increas . Esther L.

You want to see that the economi is on as stabl a foot as it can be . But histor those wait can be costly.The Fed rais it benchmark rate in Decemb for the first time sinc the financi crisi . It held short-term rate near zero for seven year to encourag borrow and risk-tak . By rais rate as the economi gain strength , the Fed now plan to gradual reduc those incent .But in March , the Fed decid against rais rate for a second time , and it indic plan to rais rate thi year by half a percentag point , not a full point .Ms. Yellen and other Fed offici have emphas sinc the meet that they do not see evid of econom weaken . The meet account describ domest growth as resilient.But a tighten of financi condit ha done some of the Fed work , rais borrow cost without an increas in the Fed benchmark rate . And the account said offici saw an increas risk that problem elsewher could disrupt the rel strength of domest growth .Sever particip express the view that the underli factor abroad that led to a sharp , though temporari , deterior in global financi condit earlier thi year had not been fulli resolv and thu pose ongo downsid risk ,  the account said . While the Fed econom forecast held steadi , the number of offici who saw underperform as the most like altern outcom jump to eight , from just three in the last survey , in Decemb .There also a strateg argument for caution . The Fed still ha littl room to respond to ani sign of weak by cut rate , it tradit and most power tool . At the same time , Ms. Yellen and her alli argu the Fed could respond to faster growth by rais rate more quickli .Thi asymmetri ,  the March meet account said , made it prudent to wait for addit inform regard the underli strength of econom activ and prospect for inflat befor take anoth step to reduc polici accommodation.Ms. Georg said thi underst the risk of move quickli . When I hear peopl say , We can rais rate quickli ,  mechan , that true ,  she said . I that desir ? I dont think so.Ms. Georg and one other offici , who did not have a vote at thi meet , agre that rate should be rais in March . A broader group , howev , wasnt readi to write off April . Sever offici , the account said , thought a rate increas then still might well be warranted.The account made clear that the Fed primari focu is on the strength of the economi , with littl concern about faster inflat .

The Fed prefer gaug estim that price increas by 1.7 percent over the 12 month that end in Februari , the highest read in some time and close to the 2 percent annual pace the Fed regard as optim .Ms. Yellen and other Fed offici , howev , have said they are not yet convinc that a strengthen trend ha taken hold .

I laid out sever reason I would not be give up my Palm Treo 700p for Apple gadget , includ the poor voic and data servic of Apple lone wireless partner , AT & T ; , and the lack of third-parti app .The iPhon ha obvious come a long way sinc then . It can now be use on ani carrier . It voic and data qualiti are stellar . Some of it built-in app , such as Appl Pay , are best in class . There are 1.5 million app creat by outsid develop .I have final cave in : My phone is now an iPhon .And I got there the way that mani other have : by switch from an Android-bas smartphon . About six week ago , I swap my two-year-old Samsung Galaxi S5 for a new iPhon 6S to better understand Apple flagship product as I began a new assign about the compani .Face with slow sale growth , Appl is count on million of peopl like me to give up their Android phone , which can be bought new for as littl as $ 30 in some countri , to purchas iPhon , which cost $ 400 or more .We were blown away by the level of Android switcher that we had last quarter ,  Apple chief execut , Timothi D. Cook , told Wall Street in Januari . We see that as a huge opportunity.As someon who ha sinc 2010 use high-end phone base on Google Android oper system , I have experienc a rocki transit , like move to a faraway citi . The landmark are unfamiliar , the custom are differ , and I miss my old haunt even as I explor new one .Switch phone oper system should in theori be simpl . First you transfer your data from the old phone to the new one . Then you reinstal your favorit app . Final you custom the set for featur like ring tone and notif and learn the quirk of your new devic .Appl ha a detail guid and a special app to help those switch from an Android . Appl also offer assist at it retail store as well as 90 day of free telephon support . Googl , which doe not itself sell most of the phone that run on Android , ha a web page of tip for those switch from an Appl .But as I learn , mani thing can go wrong , and my experi is not unusu .Your go to have to go through the thing that are most valuabl to you and make sure it all there ,  said Jonathan S. Geller , editor in chief of BGR , a tech news site that review phone and write frequent about switch . For a normal consum , it reason frustrating.Here what happen when I switch :The problem began at the outset . I download Apple switch app , Move to iO , to my Samsung and pair the two phone . The app got stuck in the middl of the data transfer and eventu froze .Verizon , my mobil carrier , offer it own method of transfer data call Verizon Cloud . I tri it but could not get the two phone to sync directli . I had to back up the Samsung to the cloud , then download the data to the iPhon .A lot of contact and photo never made it through . It wa as if a move compani had lost half my stuff dure a cross-countri haul .Appl later told me that I could have call a toll-fre number for help , gone to an Appl store or eras everyth and start over . The compani lent me anoth iPhon 6S to tri the Move to iO app again  and thi time it did transfer my data . But it fail to do the other half of the job : download the Appl version of my Android app to the new iPhon .As mani phone switcher do , I had to manual reinstal my app . Popular app like Facebook , Uber and Amazon were easi to find . But some of my standbi  includ a simpl public transit app , BART Runner  were not avail for the iPhon , and I have yet to find a perfect replac .On the flip side , I can now commun with my rel on FaceTim , Apple video chat servic , and read miss issu of The New Yorker dure long commut , someth that is much harder to do on Android .I am also now more like to get earli access to cutting-edg app , sinc American app maker tend to build for the iPhon first . Last year , for exampl , when I want to tri Twitter new Periscop live-stream app , I had to borrow my wife iPhon becaus Periscop wa not yet avail for Android .The most fundament differ between iPhon and Android is the level of conform dictat by each compani . Thi is where person prefer play a big role in custom satisfact .Appl exercis great control over the look , feel and featur of iPhon to deliv it ideal version of what it think peopl want . Android is free-form and adapt  so much so that the look and feel can vari wide from one phone maker to the next , especi in Asia .One consequ of Apple approach is that the iPhon is more stabl . Everi Android phone I have ever use ha suffer mysteri hardwar and softwar problem like random reboot and crash app . These happen much more rare in iO .But Apple control ha it downsid . The compani make it app the perman default option for common servic like map , web brows and email .Googl also requir most phone maker to make it servic the initi default on Android phone , but Android user can chang those default . For exampl , if you dont want to use Googl Map for navig , you can set your phone to automat access Here Map or Waze everi time you encount an address .In my case , I have a Window laptop ; my employ , The New York Time , use Google enterpris app ; and I depend on Google search technolog to find airlin ticket , email address and old photo store in my variou digit pocket . My life is deepli enmesh in the Googl ecosystem .To make my iPhon more familiar and my data easier to find , I put my favorit Googl app on my home screen and mostli use them instead of Apple app . Googl ha knit it iPhon app togeth so that Gmail use Google browser , Chrome , when you click on a link in an email , and Google calendar use Googl Map when you click on an address .Given the headach of switch , most peopl avoid it .Michael R. Levin , partner and co-found of Consum Intellig Research Partner , which survey smartphon user in the Unit State , said onli about one out of five peopl activ a new iPhon or Android wa switch from the other platform . In the past two year , the loyalti and switch rate have gotten veri , veri set ,  he said .Over all , I am get more comfort with my iPhon . I like Apple fingerprint reader and have final figur out how to align my fingertip precis enough to unlock the phone ( at least most of the time ) .Will the iPhon ever feel like home ? Check back in two year , when I am due for my next upgrad .', '1865 The pantelegraph , invent by Giovanni Caselli , start oper between Pari and Lyon , Franc .

An oversea transfer leav the ledger of one busi , then goe on anoth ledger at a domest bank . It then might hit the ledger of a bank in the intern transfer system . It travel to anoth bank in the foreign countri , befor end up on the ledger of the compani be paid .Each time it move to a differ ledger , the money ha a differ ident , take up time and potenti caus confus . For some compani , it is a nightmar that cant end soon enough .Whi should it take me 48 hour to make a foreign currenc payment ?  said David Morton , chief financi offic of Seagat Technolog , a major manufactur of comput data storag devic . I have 10,000 supplier and handl 100,000 invoic a month . If I could pay peopl immedi , what kind of a discount would I get ? In other word , what if one ledger could be share among all the peopl in a transact , who would agre on a common databas of valu that would do away with the need for currenc exchang ? The action would be record secur , with each particip abl to see onli the part he need to see . None of the middlemen would be need , and payment could happen much faster .That is the idea behind a distribut ledger . Seagat ha invest in Rippl and is test the technolog .The distribut ledger is best known as the underli system that make possibl Bitcoin , the stateless cryptocurr . Bitcoin got a bad name as a wildli fluctuat currenc for drug dealer and tax cheat , in part becaus it particip remain anonym . But mani bank and busi say the underli ledger technolog , if it is secur and transpar , can be more effici than our current method .Bank are struggl with differ regul , fragment system and silo practic ,  said Owen Jelf , global manag director for capit market at Accentur , which ha also work with Rippl . Wer excit about thi as a technolog to make thing more efficient.Accentur ha made sever bet on the technolog . Asid from Rippl , it ha invest in the distribut ledger compani Digit Asset Hold , and it is work with client in financi trade on use the technolog .Anoth distribut ledger platform , call Ethereum , work off the same technolog that Bitcoin doe , but it is run as an open-sourc softwar project , mean the softwar code is freeli avail for anyon to work on .Still anoth , the Hyperledg Project , recent receiv 44,000 line of code from IBM , which is share some of it softwar with develop who are tri to creat distribut ledger . IBM also plan to deploy distribut ledger intern in what would be a signific test , consid that the compani doe $ 45 billion in global financ each year .There is even the ledger system Bigchain DB that is posit as a way to prevent blood diamond  those sold to financ arm conflict  from enter the intern gem trade . ( A distribut ledger can be set up to identifi everi actor and what they do . )Ripple technolog is similar to the Bitcoin system , but with some differ that make it easi to manag a far larger number of transact at the same time . Follow Bitcoin lead , Mr. Larsen also work on develop hi own currenc , call XRP . But he later decid to incorpor XRP into hi ledger technolog as a way to improv the exist intern system , instead of overwhelm it with a new cryptocurr .He appear to have decid he will have more success by work with author on the exist problem of global transact than on a new currenc like Bitcoin , whose fan favor major disrupt . A lot of financi technolog is foolhardi ,  Mr. Larsen said . Say , Wer go to kill bank . Wer go to disrupt everyth ,  ignor some realities.A San Francisco nativ , Mr. Larsen began hi career conduct intern audit for Chevron . He graduat from Stanford Graduat School of Busi in 1991 .Five year later , he start E-Loan , one of the first onlin mortgag compani . He took it public , but left in 2005 to start Prosper Marketplac , a peer-to-p lend oper that , after initi regulatori clash over lend law , ha facilit sever billion dollars worth of loan .He left Prosper in 2012 to work on XRP and a global ledger system open to everyon trade anyth that two peopl agre wa worth someth  goat , money , labor , you name it .He start Rippl , origin Rippl Lab , in 2013 . In 2015 , it paid a $ 700,000 civil fine for sell XRP without regist with the Unit State Financi Crime Enforc Network . Then Mr. Larsen abandon hi Internet currenc plan and turn toward the bigger transact system .Perhap in a sign that regul agre it wa time to figur out how to move money in the network world , Rippl wa invit to the World Econom Forum in Davo , Switzerland , in Januari , where Mr. Larsen gave a present to central banker from 40 countri .Even die-hard Bitcoin fan seem readi to accept the idea that the most promis approach to reform financi transact  at least for now  is to focu on the system , rather than on a currenc .What Chri and hi team have done is to work within exist constraint ,  said Barri Silbert , founder of the Digit Currenc Group , which ha made 67 invest in financi technolog busi . Longer term , well see if that can compet with an entir new system.', 'Last summer Jimmi Chen walk the street of San Francisco tri to do simpl financi transact without a bank account , a task million of American face .It cost him $ 4 to cash a $ 20 person check and $ 5 to send $ 30 to a rel  activ that would have been free with a bank account . When he need to retriev a money transfer , the process of verifi hi ident took so long he almost gave up .These are the sort of problem that might seem ripe for new financi technolog to address  provid cheaper , faster way to do basic financi servic for some of the nine million or so American household without a bank account .But most hot start-up in fintech , as it is known , are more focus on wealthi custom . Mr. Chen wa in San Francisco as part of a new program tri to chang that imbal . The Financi Solut Lab pick Mr. Chen compani , Propel , and eight other start-up for it first class last year , all of them aim at build solut for financi health.In Mr. Chen case , Propel is work on an app to make it easier to get access to the feder food stamp system . The rel lack of new entrant tri to address problem face by the less wealthi is caus , in no small part , by the lack of familiar with these problem among young , larg affluent entrepreneur like Mr. Chen , a 28-year-old former engin at Facebook .It hard to solv a problem you dont understand ,  he said .The compani in the Financi Solut Lab first gather last Juli . Mr. Chen and the other start-up in the lab went out into San Francisco on a sort of scaveng hunt to experi the expens financi servic that are the onli option for mani low-incom American . In the month after , the compani gather sever more time to get guidanc on how to build afford financi servic while still adher to the manifold regul that fall on the financi industri .The nine start-up also got $ 250,000 to financ their effort . The lab wa start by a financi nonprofit group in Chicago , the Center for Financi Servic Innov , in partnership with JPMorgan Chase philanthrop foundat , which provid $ 30 million and lot of connect for the compani that enter the lab .The lab ha had to strike a difficult balanc of find start-up that want to serv low-incom peopl without overcharg them and make their problem wors . Mani payday lender and prepaid card supplier say they exist to help their client , but end up prey on their financi vulner .Ryan Falvey , the director of the lab , said that among the 300 applic to the program last year , mani did not meet the Center for Financi Servic Innovation guid principl of encourag inclus , upward mobil and posit consum behavior . There are a lot of product out there that are at odd with the consum ,  he said . They can make a lot of money , and the consum can find themselv in wors and wors shape.But Mr. Falvey said it wa not hard to find start-up that genuin seem to want to help their custom improv their financi health . He point to one of the lab most success start-up , Ascend , which wa found in part by a member of the Consum Financi Protect Bureau consum advisori board , Steve Carlson .Ascend provid loan of a few thousand dollar to borrow who fall between the prime and subprim categori . The loan start with an annual interest rate around 30 percent , but it can drop to 14 percent if borrow take step like save money or limit credit card spend .The busi model ha been promis enough that ventur capitalist have put $ 1.5 million into Ascend . Anoth particip in the lab wa a nonprofit from Manhattan that is tri to build a mobil phone app , PayGoal , to help client make better financi decis .Justin Zinkin , the chief execut of the nonprofit that creat PayGoal , Neighborhood Trust Financi Partner , said she went into the program somewhat skeptic of JPMorgan involv and the cynic possibl of a larg bank claim to care about the littl consumer. But she said the bank execut involv in the program went abov and beyond to provid her and the other lab particip with resourc and connect to help them improv their product .Mr. Chen said Chase execut spent hour help him and hi two co-found understand the entir rout a payment travel after a custom swipe a card at a store . But for Propel the biggest lesson have come from go to poor neighborhood where peopl use food stamp .These lesson led hi team to chang the focu of Propel from help peopl sign up for food stamp to make it easier to check the balanc in a food stamp account , someth that had been virtual imposs from a smartphon .The lesson learn on the street are just the sort of thing that Mr. Falvey , who is now choos the second class of lab particip , is hope he can push more young entrepreneur to pursu .I think that there is a huge dispar between how most consum live their financi live  quickli , on the edg and with a signific degre of stress , and a lot of distrust of financi servic provid  and the world that mani of our financi product were design for ,  he said .', 'SAN FRANCISCO  The world is a danger , unpredict place  not a bad thing , perhap , if your in the busi of sell insur , make loan or figur out way to prevent mishap .But these day , technolog is chang some of the calcul around risk , whether for car insur , life insur , flood insur or even vacation-rel accid insur , and slowli but sure disrupt the financi core of the insur busi .Take the old saw that younger driver are alway the riskiest to insur , for exampl . Is it alway true ?A 22-year-old driver who parti a lot and drive 10,000 mile a year , or a 40-year-old teetot mom who drive 40,000 mile ? I might think the mom is riskier ,  said Dan Preston , the chief execut of Metromil . Speed a lot or brake hard , unless your go 100 mile an hour , it doesnt make much difference.Instead , all those extra mile the mother is safe and soberli drive mean she is more often where the accid are happen . Or , as Mr. Preston put it , Seventi percent of the variant around expect loss can be deriv from mileage.Financi technolog is not just chang by faster comput with more power softwar . Technolog also chang thing like mobil comput , data collect and what peopl can measur . Put those togeth creativ and you chang ani busi involv in calcul risk  in other word , most of the financi world .On a planet cover by location-sens satellit and cell tower , it is not difficult to put a devic in a car and insur peopl base larg on mileag . That is the basic idea behind Metromil , which began in Oregon in 2012 , and now sell insur in seven state .Custom fill out the usual inform , like age and locat  the thing tradit use to guess the likelihood a car will be wreck or stolen . That data determin a Metromil base rate for insur , and premium rise base on mile driven . Peopl who stay below the nation averag of about 12,000 mile annual can save substanti , compar with tradit insur .Peopl are , in effect , agre to be observ in exchang for the save , which enabl Metromil to add servic . It ha becom a way for Uber driver to stay insur while they are drive for money , someth their tradit polici may not cover .Metromile location-bas knowledg let it warn driver to remov their car from a street that will be swept soon , help them avoid a ticket . The track devic can hook into a car comput , warn the driver when the car might need mainten .While peopl may be uncertain about govern monitor , they seem to be will to have compani look over their shoulder  at least if it save them money .It is someth insur want badli , said Jame Whittl , chief claim counsel for the American Insur Associ . Lot of insur are drill down to the precis granular of risk ,  he said .Expect more . Cellphon , sensor and cheap comput make it possibl to valu all sort of object , includ car , hous , camera and ski , while gain insight into how they are like to be use next . That chang the bet for the risk industri .Metromil is the start of a broader shift ,  said Mark McLaughlin , global insur director for IBM . Insur compani want to shift from pay when someth bad happen to help you prevent someth bad happen to you ,  he said .He predict a time when a car insur might learn drivers commut rout and warn them if there is a chanc of a hailstorm ahead , even text them a Starbuck coupon to encourag them to wait out the risk . Last Octob , IBM bought the digit asset of the Weather Channel , perhap in anticip of such a servic . IBM declin to discuss futur product .Mani tradit insur are alreadi adopt thi observ approach and use discount to sway behavior . Some exampl includ Progress Auto Insur , which ha a servic similar to Metromil , call Snapshot .The compani Vital ha unit with sever insur to offer peopl lower rate in exchang for log their health data . It give peopl thing like Fitbit and Appl Watch to automat track their activ . State Farm Insur , in conjunct with the home secur compani ADT , offer discount for peopl who get home monitor system .Insur , which is after all a busi where peopl take money with a promis to mayb pay for someth someday , is a highli regul enterpris that histor favor slow-mov compani with lot of capit . In thi case , howev , Mr. Preston say he ha an edg on establish competit .The challeng for the incumb is that the low-mileag custom are most of their profit ,  he said at Metromile headquart here in a convert park garag . They are subsid the high-mileag driver ,  he said . Those are the peopl we attract.Metromile co-found and board chairman is David Friedberg , an earli employe at Googl , who also found what becam the Climat Corpor . Climat , which use data on thing like rainfal and soil qualiti to insur sever type of crop , wa bought by Monsanto for more than $ 900 million in 2013 .The new method of measur are affect lend , too . ZestFin look at thousand of nonstandard variabl , includ technolog use and how peopl complet form , to assess a lender risk of thing like fraud and loan default . Upstart is a lend servic that target younger borrow , set rate base on colleg major and job histori , among other factor . Not surprisingli , ZestFin and Upstart were also found by former data specialist .In March , Palantir , a privat held compani that ha use large-scal data analysi for a varieti of task , includ catch terrorist and determin how bank can effici sell subprim bankruptci , form a joint ventur with Credit Suiss that will use large-scal data analysi to detect insid trade .The next move may be not just microsl hous and drivers behavior , but also individu object in a hous . Trov , a start-up in Danvil , Calif. , use a smartphon app to photograph and valu object like ski and camera . Custom can then buy insur for a weekend of ski . It might even sens when a policyhold is near the slope and ask if the policyhold want to activ the insur .The next gener understand the atom of everyth ,  said Scott Walchek , the founder and chief execut of Trov . Atom mean slice thing to their smallest compon , in thi case not insur a whole hous of good but individu object . Insur have to get readi for custom who expect to have their ownership of everyth , how they use thing , understood . On-demand everyth is the zeitgeist.', 'SAN FRANCISCO  Sinc 2005 , Reddit ha been a verit wonderland for the most extrem form of free speech on the Internet .On thi gener interest messag board , all it take to make  or break  someon else day on Reddit is a fleet thought , a made-up screen name and a few quick keystrok .But with the site pseudonym have come other byproduct . Some of Reddit biggest detractor claim the web discuss forum is a breed ground for troll , a hub that help them organ and spread like a viru across the rest of the Internet .Reddit ha in recent month start to address onlin abus , and on Wednesday it took one of it bigger step toward help individu gain some control over tormentor : The compani said it would give peopl a block featur to shield themselv against harass on the site , move to prohibit abus user from send messag to other .The block featur will build on the concept that the less expos to neg speech user are on Reddit , the more they will want to engag with the commun . That is import for the compani , base in San Francisco , which aim to spread far beyond the 243 million uniqu monthli visitor it current serv and break into the mainstream conscious , much like a Facebook or a Twitter  with a similar abil to command onlin advertis .The block tool could also serv to curtail the spread of onlin abus beyond Reddit wall . Vitriol on the site can sometim erupt into larger meme , spill over into social media and other avenu and creat further repercuss . That behavior is also stoke by other digit haunt that are the favorit of troll , includ site like 4chan and 8chan .Reddit influenc goe far , said Anil Dash , a web entrepreneur who ha work on blog platform like Livejourn . A post on Reddit is similar to one tweet , embed anywher , and how it can travel veri long distanc ,  he said .Other have less faith in Reddit abil to clamp down on the Internet noxiou element , especi given the amount of time it took the compani to take on abus in the first place . Reddit ha long been home to racist , misogynist subcultur in area call subreddit  small , topic-bas forum where user can discuss whatev they wish . In autumn 2014 , Reddit user trade stolen nude photo of celebr like basebal card , all organ in a subreddit .When your just now address the easiest solut , it doesnt speak well for what Reddit prioriti are ,  said Brianna Wu , head of develop at Giant Spacekat , a game studio . Ms. Wu , who describ herself a frequent target of the kind of abus they are tri to stop ,  wa the recipi of mani threat in 2014 becaus of comment she made about women in the video game industri .Reddit creation of the block tool , which is avail to all regist user , ha not gone over well with all of it user base . When the site wa found in 2005 by Steve Huffman and Alexi Ohanian , colleg dorm mate from the Univers of Virginia , it took a laissez-fair approach to Internet commentari . The philosophi wa to let forum member post almost anyth they want and let the rest sort itself out .As a result , ani restrict are consid an affront to the open aspect of commun dialogu . On Wednesday , five hour after announc the block tool , there were more than 2,300 comment in respons to the featur . Some prais the move while other critic it .The outcom then will be mani subreddit where groupthink will domin , and discuss will be suppress ,  wrote Donnadr , a Reddit user , in a post on the site discuss the new featur .In an interview , Mr. Ohanian acknowledg that shift the site away from some of it root is hard . Peopl , gener , do not like chang ,  he said . We have to do what is best for Reddit over all.The compani ha maintain that the number of nastier subreddit is minuscul among the ten of thousand of other subforum devot to thing like makeup , televis show or food .The idea for the block tool is similar to a muting function use by Twitter , the 320 million-us social network that also face critic for the way it handl onlin abus . When you block a user on Reddit , you will no longer see that person respons to your post . That person will not know about the block , a strategi aim at keep them from simpli creat anoth user account .Some Reddit employe attribut the creation of the new tool to an infus of resourc , includ dozen of new employe and more than $ 50 million in ventur capit rais in Octob 2014 . Last May , the compani institut a polici that forbad harass on the site . Then in Juli , Mr. Huffman becam chief execut of the compani in a manag shake-up .Shortli after hi return , Mr. Huffman told The New York Time that Reddit  can not turn a blind eye toward vulgar onlin behavior . He quickli enforc a set of new content rule that explicitli ban post content that violat a common sens of decenc ,  and encourag peopl to report harass to commun moder .For a veri long time it wa all we could do to just keep the site up ,  said Chri Slow , one of Reddit first hire and the engin who work on the block tool . Mr. Slow said he would like to see Reddit get closer to build autom system that detect abus across the site , though he did not give a timelin for such technolog .Now wer final at a point where wev been grow the team and can deal with thing like fundament product problem such as thi ,  Mr. Slow said .', 'The Labor Depart introduc new rule on Wednesday that will help protect American save for retir . While investor often assum those handl their save are provid advic in their best interest , that is not alway the case . Here is how thing will chang .What do the new rule mean for me ?Onc the rule go into effect next year , all financi profession who provid advic relat to your retir money must provid recommend that are in your best interest . Act in your best interest may seem obviou , but it hasnt been requir in most case .The new standard appli to all financi product that can potenti land insid a tax-advantag retir account  includ I.R.A. and 401 ( k ) -type plan  from mutual fund to variabl annuiti .How might my invest option chang ?The new rule do not tri to singl out ani one invest as a poor option . But the chang are like to encourag more firm to steer custom toward lower-cost invest , notabl index fund , a trend that is alreadi well underway . The regul are also expect to acceler the movement away from commission-bas invest and toward fee-bas account .More complex invest like variabl annuiti may fall off in sale . In respons , insur compani may adopt lower price , accord to an industri report by the research firm Cerulli Associ , while emphas product that gener predict incom , includ immedi and deferred-incom annuiti .Doe thi rule mean that all financi advis are now equal ?Absolut not . Even though some may call themselv financi advis , there are still variou type of profession with differ legal requir , expertis and credenti . It is still import that you work with an advis who is equip to address your entir financi pictur .What will chang soon , howev , is that all financi profession who provid advic relat to your retir money must act as fiduciari  the legal way of say they are requir to put their customers interest ahead of their own financi gain .But the qualiti of the advic you receiv can still vari base on the provid you are work with .How do financi advis differ ?Thi get confus , so brace yourself . Broker are technic known as regist repres . They are requir onli to recommend suitable invest base on an investor person situat  age , invest goal and appetit for risk , among other thing . But under the new rule , a broker who handl your retir asset must act exclus in your best interest , even if that will cost the broker some potenti incom .As for the rest of your money , includ regular brokerag account , that may still be subject to the lesser suitabl standard .To make matter more befuddl , there are some specif situat when broker must act as fiduciari for nonretir account  for exampl , when they collect a percentag of total asset to manag an invest account , or when they are given full control of an investor account .So doe anyon have to look out for my best interest , 100 percent of the time ?Ye , inde . Invest advis , who gener must regist with the Secur and Exchang Commiss or a state secur regul , must put their customers interest first , regardless of what account they work with .You are still like to get the purest advic from a financi planner who is paid a flat fee in which compens is not tie to the sale of ani one invest . Such advis should be free to choos from a wide array of financi product .Will financi firm have to mention competitors product ?No . If a salesperson sell onli annuiti that it own firm manufactur , he or she is not oblig to tell you about compet product on the market that they do not offer . As Labor Secretari Thoma E. Perez said on Tuesday , when you walk into a Ford dealership , you arent go to be told about Chevi down the block .In an ideal world , all financi advis would be abl to choos the best invest for investor from a wide univers of product . But the rule do not aim to destroy the way exist firm do busi  and some offer a limit menu .Regul will requir firm that onli sell proprietari product to fulli disclos that they are onli offer a restrict menu of product , and they must offer a best-interest contract to custom .What happen when investor believ they have been misl ?If advis do not adher to the standard , retir investor should have greater recours to recov their money . They have the right to take legal action . Still , most disput would be resolv in arbitr , not the court , sinc most invest firm requir that disput be settl that way . Investor can also take part in class-act lawsuit .Who exactli must adher to the new rule ?Onc the rule are enact , anyon who provid invest advic for a fee must act as a fiduciari .Not everi word an advis mutter will be subject to the fiduciari rule . But onc he or she make a recommend  or suggest a particular cours of action  the advis is requir to act sole in the customer best interest .When do the rule take effect ?Financi profession must act as fiduciari begin in April 2017 . But they wont have to adopt all of the requir procedur until Jan. 1 , 2018 .What about advic that Iv alreadi receiv ?Ani recommend provid befor April 2017 are subject to the old , less stringent rule .But all new money be invest must be in the best interest of the client ; the same goe for ani new recommend on money alreadi invest . If you have concern , tell your advis you want him or her to act as a fiduciari .Whi do I need to sign a contract with my advis ?There are conflict of interest embed in the way mani brokerag and insur firm do busi . The new rule allow them to continu to receiv the type of compens that pose conflict , like be paid commiss .But those firm will need to provid an enforc contract that promis to put your interest first . The firm must also disclos those conflict , charg onli reason compens , tell investor how they are paid on it websit and adopt appropri polici to compli with the new rule .Regul said the contract  which wont be requir until 2018  can be sign at the same time you complet other paperwork to open an account . ( Ani advic provid befor sign must still be imparti and in the customer best interest . )Exist custom might receiv an email from the firm they alreadi do busi with , acknowledg the customer new right . No action is necessari , unless you object to the notice term .Could the rule still be block ?It possibl . The financi servic and insur industri have aggress lobbi against the rule , and they could take legal action . For now , variou industri associ said they were still pars all the detail .Congress could also tri to kill the rule , but Presid Obama ha said he would veto ani legisl . If a Republican were to win the presid and take over in earli 2017 , when the rule is still be implement , the new administr could tri to dismantl the regul .', 'Ad fuel to an increasingli contenti deal , the William Compani on Wednesday said it wa su Energi Transfer Equiti and it chief execut , Kelci Warren , for breach their merger agreement .It is a bizarr turn of event for the $ 38 billion deal between William and Energi Transfer , which wa sign in Septemb but ha sinc been drag into the gutter with the sharp declin in commod price .

It wa the first contest after the departur of Marco Rubio that wa truli competit , and it look as if Mr. Cruz benefit a lot . In fact , with a final result of 48 percent , he won a larger share of the vote than in ani primari thi year .There no guarante that thi pattern hold for the rest of the race . But Mr. Trump will not come veri close to amass a major of Republican deleg if it doe .It not surpris that Mr. Trump lost Wisconsin . For month , it look to be one of hi worst state , whether in the big pre-primari survey by Civi Analyt , poll from Marquett Law or in The Upshot statist model base on the result after Super Tuesday or March 15 .Inde , we expect Mr. Trump to win around 35 percent of the vote , base on a model of the result . That exactli what he won . Perhap he could have hope to be a bit higher with Mr. Rubio out of the race , but it not necessarili a sign that hi abort comment cost him much ground .Mr. Trump challeng in Wisconsin wasnt momentum , it wa demograph . But what turn Tuesday night into a 13-point victori wa the growth in support for Mr. Cruz .Mr. Cruz wa well ahead of the 41 percent project by the same model . It wa also abov hi typic result in pre-elect poll .It wa forese that Mr. Cruz could outperform the model thi way , at least to some extent . The model didnt includ ani potenti gain from Mr. Rubio departur from the race , and Mr. Rubio wa still on track to win about 8 percent of the vote in Wisconsin when he left . Split those vote evenli with John Kasich might have gotten Mr. Cruz up into the mid-40 .But Mr. Kasich didnt exactli split those vote with Mr. Cruz ; he actual fell back to 14 percent of the vote . Mr. Kasich total wa less than the model estim ( 18 percent ) , less than the pre-elect poll point toward ( all at least 17 percent ) , and less than he receiv in nearbi Michigan ( 24 percent ) and Illinoi ( 20 percent ) .It appear that mani moder voter , who have long been the biggest obstacl to Mr. Cruz , final broke hi way . Accord to exit poll , Mr. Cruz won 29 percent of them  far higher than the 12 percent he won in Michigan and 15 percent in Illinoi . Mr. Kasich share of the vote among both self-describ moderate and somewhat conservative voter drop .Perhap noth exemplifi Mr. Cruz newfound competit in moder area better than Madison Dane Counti , where he won by a comfort eight-point margin and 38 percent of the vote . Just a coupl of week ago , he finish third in place like Ann Arbor , Mich. , and Chicago .Mr. Cruz strength did have limit . It wa heavili concentr in the more popul eastern part of the state . In the older , more rural , less religi and less educ western and northern area of the state , Mr. Trump still ran far ahead of Mr. Cruz .The distinctli region element of Mr. Cruz strength at least rais the possibl that it wont be replic elsewher . The region is one of the few place in the northern Unit State where Republican domin in well-educ suburb . ( Orang Counti , Calif. , and Indianapoli are similar and still to come . )But perhap the best reason to think it still might be part of a broader phenomenon for Mr. Cruz is that he ha outperform expect at everi point sinc Super Tuesday . He nearli doubl hi support in the contest immedi after Super Tuesday , as Mr. Rubio falter . He post strong show on March 15  like clear 40 percent of the vote in Missouri and 30 percent in Illinoi  that were larg overlook becaus it wa not enough for him to win .Those gain put Mr. Cruz veri near the point where he could prevent Mr. Trump from earn a major of deleg  close enough where mere split the remaind of Mr. Rubio vote would be enough .If Mr. Cruz step forward is repres of the rest of hi race , Mr. Trump will no longer be on track to amass a major of deleg . Here one way to think about it : If Mr. Cruz outperform our model by the same amount that he did Tuesday , Mr. Trump will go from a favorit to an underdog in California , Indiana , Maryland and Montana . Pennsylvania would be competit . Mr. Trump would not even be near the 1,237 deleg need to win the nomin .It still too earli to know whether Mr. Cruz gain will prove durabl . It arguabl a littl troubl for Mr. Cruz that Mr. Kasich underperform hi final poll number , sinc it may mean that Mr. Kasich support were act strateg to stop Mr. Trump in a state where Mr. Cruz had a clear lead and vocal support from the state trust Republican establish  someth he might not benefit from elsewher . The same factor might have help Mr. Cruz claim a disproportion share of Mr. Rubio former support .We wont learn whether Mr. Cruz ha made a big new round of gain for a while . The next competit contest is in two week , and it in New York , where mere hold Mr. Trump beneath 50 percent of the vote could be consid a win .But thi wa probabl the first contest sinc Iowa where the result were consist with a path toward deni Mr. Trump a major of deleg . That didnt keep happen after Iowa  which is a nice remind to be cautiou about a singl data point , especi becaus Wisconsin and Iowa are neighbor and demograph similar state . But it might realli repres a turn point in the race .', 'Pfizer need a Plan C .Two year ago , the pharmaceut giant tri  and fail  to take over the British rival AstraZeneca in a bid to becom the world largest drug compani and lower it tax bill in the process .

The company stock ha been grow steadili , but investor are certain to start agit again to complet a bold move to push growth higher .The compani ha basic two choic : get bigger , or break apart .If it goe hunt for a new acquisit , it option are far more limit now than they were just last week . On Tuesday , the Obama administr introduc an aggress and expans seri of rule chang aim at limit so-cal invers , which allow an American compani to shed it Unit State corpor citizenship to move incom beyond the reach of American tax author .A big part of Allergan appeal wa that the company tax domicil is in Ireland . But with the chang to the rule , those tax benefit went away  as they most like would in similar deal between Pfizer and a compani in a low-tax countri .Still , share of sever foreign pharmaceut compani were trade higher on Wednesday , includ AstraZeneca , GlaxoSmithKlin and Shire , perhap on specul that Pfizer would still pursu an oversea acquisit .Pfizer approach thi transact from a posit of strength and view the potenti combin as an acceler of exist strategi ,  Ian C.

But some analyst saw signific in a statement by Mr. Read that indic the compani plan to decid whether to break itself up by the end of thi year . Some analyst lobbi for such a move becaus they argu that two smaller and more focus compani would be worth more than one bigger one .The fact that the compani is talk about the origin split-up decis timelin of late 2016 almost seem to suggest they have given up on invers ,  said Tim Anderson , a senior analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Compani , in a note to investor . Mr. Anderson said Pfizer could have seen the Allergan deal as an opportun , but onc it did not happen , perhap it is back to usual busi onc again.Mr. Anderson , who had previous support a breakup , note that the company statement did not mean Pfizer had settl on split . But by rais the issu , he wrote , thi essenti put the carrot back in front of the stock again.Pfizer plan to make itself smaller date to 2011 , when Mr. Read , who had recent taken over as chief execut , announc plan to becom a more focus compani follow a seri of multibillion-dollar acquisit . Under Mr. Read direct , the compani slash it research and develop budget and , in 2012 , sold it infant nutrit busi to Nestl . In 2013 , it spun off it anim health busi into what is now Zoeti .In 2014 , the compani divid it busi into two segment  one devot to new brand-nam medicin and the other to older medic that had lost patent protect . That wa seen as a preliminari step toward break the compani in two .Those plan reced , howev , when Pfizer decid to follow in the footstep of mani of it competitor by perform an invers , in which an American compani acquir an oversea rival and reincorpor oversea .In 2014 , Pfizer tri to acquir AstraZeneca , but it ultim abandon the pursuit after AstraZeneca repeatedli snub Pfizer approach . The propos takeov also face stiff polit opposit over potenti job loss in Britain .Invers have gain popular in recent year , particularli in the pharmaceut industri , as Unit State compani look to lower their corpor tax rate and more easili use incom that ha been held in foreign subsidiari . About 40 compani have struck invers over the last five year , accord to data from Dealog .A move by the Obama administr to begin to tighten rule on invers in 2014 kill some deal , includ AbbVie plan $ 54 billion takeov of it Irish counterpart Shire . But those rule chang ultim fail to stem the tide of American compani seek foreign partner to reduc their tax rate .Presid Obama said on Tuesday that the new rule would help prevent compani from take advantag of one of the most insidi tax loophol out there , flee the countri just to get out of pay their taxes.The latest rule chang seem to specif target the Pfizer-Allergan merger , elimin mani of the deal tax benefit .Now that such a deal is less attract , Pfizer would be smart to return to it earlier plan , said Erik Gordon , a busi professor at the Univers of Michigan who follow the pharmaceut industri .What do you have now ?  he said . Now you have the same Pfizer that wa go to split , that what.Regardless of what path it choos , major player like Pfizer can not afford to stand still , said Dimitri Drone , who lead the pharmaceut merger and acquisit practic at PricewaterhouseCoop .The larger a compani get , the harder it is to demonstr growth  it just the law of number ,  he said .

Perez , the secretari of labor , said in an interview . Thi is no longer a market slogan . It the law.The new regul , which may be challeng in court , were propos a year ago by the depart  which overse pension and retir account  and were modifi after hear and industri critic . They are not expect to take effect until next spring at the earliest .Mani consum assum the individu and firm invest their money are oper under the same sort of ethic and legal standard as a famili doctor  someon who is oblig to provid the veri best advic .But broker are gener requir onli to recommend suitable invest , which mean , for exampl , that they can push a more expens mutual fund that pay a higher commiss when an otherwis ident , cheaper fund would have been an equal or better altern .The Obama administr , reli on extens academ research , estim that conflict of interest embed in the way mani invest profession do busi cost American about $ 17 billion a year , lead to annual return that are about 1 percentag point lower .It ha the potenti to realli chang the way advic is deliv to retail investor ,  said Barbara Roper , director of investor protect at the Consum Feder of America . It is a realli big deal . Revolutionari , even.The so-cal conflict-of-interest rule cover onli tax-advantag retir account and doe not appli to most other invest . But it could lead to more sweep chang across the financi servic industri , make it harder for some smaller firm to do busi and perhap encourag a further consolid into larger compani better abl to handl the detail rule of complianc .It is also expect to promot a shift away from commiss for individu transact toward a greater relianc on flat annual fee for manag account , a move that would not benefit all investor equal .Critic of the rule in it earlier propos form said they were still review the specif detail of the new regul to determin it effect on investor .Jule Gaudreau , presid of the Nation Associ of Insur and Financi Advisor , whose member includ insur agent and broker , said the organ wa pleas that the Labor Depart had incorpor some of the chang it suggest .But he said hi member still had reserv . We remain concern ,  Mr. Gaudreau said , that the cost to implement such a complex rule will result in higher cost and reduc access to advic , servic and product for retir savers.For the last year , the industri ha lobbi Congress to delay or kill the rule , so far without success . Befor go ahead with the final rule , the Labor Depart held four day of public hear at which nearli 80 parti testifi ; it also receiv more than 3,000 comment on the propos from consum advoc , industri stakehold and other .We heard the concern . We listen . We act ,  Secretari Perez said . And I think we improv the rule as a result.Gener speak , the new rule  six year in the make  requir a broader group of profession to act as fiduciari ,  the legal term for put customers interest first . They can not accept compens or payment that would creat a conflict unless they qualifi for an exempt that ensur the custom is protect .If broker want to receiv certain type of compens that can pose a conflict , they will be requir to offer an enforc contract that promis to put the customer interest first .The firm must also disclos ani conflict and direct consum to a websit that describ how they make money . Firm can charg onli reason compens ,  and they can not offer advis financi incent to act in a way that would hurt investor .In use the contract , broker will still be permit to charg commiss and engag in a practic known as revenu share , which allow a mutual fund compani , for exampl , to share a slice of it revenu with the brokerag firm sell the fund . Compani that pay more , for exampl , may secur a spot on the firm list of recommend fund .The rule also aim to protect investor when they roll over money from a 401 ( k ) retir plan to an I.R.A . Right now , becaus the recommend provid is consid one-time advic , broker do not necessarili have to act in the investor best interest .There are pile of money at stake : Individu retir account held $ 7.3 trillion at the end of 2015 , accord to the Invest Compani Institut , while 401 ( k ) -type plan had $ 6.7 trillion  money that may eventu be roll over into I.R.A. .Mr. Perez said that govern rule maker had made sever chang to their last propos in an effort to respond to critic and avoid creat a bia toward certain invest product . He said advis would not be oblig to sell lowest-cost product if a more expens product like a variabl annuiti made sens for a particular individual situat .The industri wa also concern that simpli provid educ inform could set off the rule ; regul said that educ would not be consid advic until a broker made a specif recommend .Wall Street wa worri that broker would need to provid a contract even befor they began talk with a potenti client . Regul said the contract can be sign at the same time as other account-open document , though ani advic given befor the sign must still be in the customer best interest .The new rule also simplifi disclosur . For exampl , firm will no longer be requir to disclos perform project for one , five- and 10-year period .There are also allow for small 401 ( k ) plan . Under the final rule , advis who provid advic to small busi that sponsor 401 ( k ) plan , or plan with less than $ 50 million , as well as advic to particip , can qualifi for an exempt from the strictest rule .Consum advoc and lawyer say that a robust fiduciari rule will help thwart more unscrupul broker , like the one encount by Russel Kazda , a retir mechan , and hi wife , Christin , a fourth-grad teacher in Illinoi .Their advis took $ 172,000 of the Kazdas I.R.A . save and put it in illiquid real estat invest trust and later invest money in an option strategi . They end up lose about $ 125,000 , which prompt the Kazda to sue the advis .I could have had my fourth grader do it and they wouldv done a better job ,  Mrs. Kazda said .Andrew Stoltmann , a secur lawyer in Chicago who repres the Kazda , applaud the chang .Bi impos a fiduciari duti standard , thi will caus the brokerag firm to self-polic ,  he said , protect most peopl from often unsuit invest like nontrad REIT , variabl annuiti in I.R.A. and activ trade of stock and options.', 'PARI  Alexandr de Juniac , the chief execut of Air France-KLM , is step down to run the airlin industry main trade group , the Intern Air Transport Associ .No successor ha yet been appoint , inject a note of uncertainti into a compani emerg from four year of restructur amid tough competit from low-cost carrier and Persian Gulf rival .Air France-KLM said on Tuesday in a statement that it would appoint headhunt to find a replac , ad that Mr. de Juniac would take up hi new post in Geneva by Aug. 1 .Mr. de Juniac departur to replac the director gener of the Intern Air Transport Associ , Toni Tyler , who retir in June , wa not wide expect .He wa given a new four-year mandat by the airline sharehold last May .Choos a successor will be a polit delic task for France Socialist govern after recent unrest over job cut .

The more coal and oil countri burn  and the more planet-warm carbon dioxid they emit  the higher the econom growth .And so it seem logic that ani polici to reduc emiss would also push countri into econom declin .Now there are sign that G.D.P . growth and carbon emiss need not rise in tandem , and that the era of decoupl could be start . Last year , for the first time in the 40 year sinc both metric have been record , a studi by the Intern Energi Agenc found that in 2014 , as global G.D.P . grew , global carbon emiss level off . Economist got excit , but they also acknowledg that it could have been an anomal blip .But a studi releas by the Intern Energi Agenc last month found that the trend continu in 2015 . In anoth studi publish on Tuesday , Nathaniel Aden , a research fellow at the World Resourc Institut , a Washington think tank , found that sinc the start of the 21st centuri , 21 countri , includ the Unit State , have alreadi fulli decoupl their econom growth from carbon emiss . In those countri , while G.D.P . went up over the past 15 year , carbon pollut went down .It realli excit , and it suggest that countri can sever the histor link between econom growth and greenhous ga emiss ,  Mr. Aden said .Of cours , even if 21 countri have achiev decoupl , more than 170 countri have not . They continu to follow the tradit econom path of growth directli tie to carbon pollut . Among those are some of the world biggest pollut : China , India , Brazil and Indonesia .And decoupl by just 21 countri is not enough to save the planet as we know it . Over the 15 year that Mr. Aden studi , the decoupl countri lower emiss about 1 billion ton  but overal global emiss grew about 10 billion ton .The question is whether what happen in the 21 countri can be a model for the rest of the world . Almost all of them are European , but not all are advanc Group of 20 economi . Bulgaria , Romania and Uzbekistan are among them .The Pari Agreement , the landmark climat chang accord reach in Decemb , commit nearli everi countri to action to tackl climat chang  and to continu increas the intens of those action in the come decad . But absent major breakthrough in decoupl , govern are like to be hesit to take aggress step to curb emiss if they mean econom loss .In the Unit State , the decoupl of emiss and econom growth wa driven chiefli by the boom in domest natur ga , which when burn produc about half the carbon pollut of coal . The glut of cheap natur ga drove electr util away from coal , while still light and power ever more home and factori . The decoupl wa also driven by improv in energy-effici technolog .The decoupl trend held even in the Unit State industri sector . Between 2000 and 2014 , Mr. Aden found that energy-rel carbon dioxid emiss drop 16 percent in the American industri sector , while econom activ increas 9 percent .But decoupl can hurt . Even as the industri sector grew over all in those year , a push by American factori to use more energy-effici technolog contribut to a 21 percent loss of industri job , Mr. Aden say .In smaller economi , decoupl hurt less . Sweden experienc econom growth of 31 percent as it emiss fell 8 percent , continu a longstand trend driven by it tax on carbon emiss , institut in 1991 . Today , Sweden get nearli half of it electr from nuclear power , which produc no emiss , and 35 percent from renew sourc , particularli hydroelectr .But in larg , industri economi that are tri to decoupl , the chang rais thorni question . For exampl , will the pollut just move elsewher ? In Britain , emiss fell 20 percent between 2000 and 2014 , while G.D.P . grew 27 percent . That wa larg the result of a push to de-industri in the countri that gave birth to the Industri Revolut . As Britain financi and servic sector grew and it coal mine , mill and steel factori close , some of those industri went to China , which becam the world largest pollut .Accord to Mr. Aden studi , China G.D.P . ha increas 270 percent sinc 2000 and it carbon emiss 178 percent . But there are veri tent sign that even China may be decoupl .In a paper publish last month by the journal Climat Polici , two British research made the case that China emiss may have peak in 2014 and have now begun a modest declin . It hard to know for sure becaus China self-report emiss data can be faulti . But if it is true , and China economi continu on even a modest growth path , it could have profound implic for the futur of climat chang . The question with China is if they realli have turn the corner and if it can stick ,  Mr. Aden said .Decoupl present anoth problem . The countri that have achiev decoupl have de-industri  and that ha increas incom inequ ,  Bill Cassidi , a Unit State senat from Louisiana , said in an interview . One of the thing that ha not been analyz is the job prospect for those famili . There go to be unintend consequ of their livelihood be curtailed.Meanwhil , some left-w economist still say that the dream of decoupl is just that  and that the onli way to truli lower emiss will be to bite the bullet and accept a hit to the economi .Im not say it imposs to decoupl , but we have to be skeptic ,  said Giorgo Kalli , an editor of the book Degrowth and an economist at the Univers of Barcelona . I dont believ that an economi power by solar and renew can sustain the same level of econom growth . If we are seriou about reduc emiss , we can not do the wish think that the economi will doubl everi 35 year . We have to ask , can we manag without growth ? But Mr. Aden remain optimist , say , We may be on the verg of a transit where thi relationship is final unhinging.', 'JUST a week after Facebook releas the Oculu Rift , the first high-pow virtual realiti devic for consum , a less public contend ha arriv : the HTC Vive .Similar to the Rift , the Vive  a joint develop by the Taiwanes manufactur HTC and the video game distribut compani Valv  is a virtual realiti headset that connect to a power comput .The Vive is even more expens than the Rift  it cost $ 799 for the headset and $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 for a compat comput . Facebook Oculu sell the Rift headset for $ 599 , or $ 1,500 when the system is bundl with a comput .There are plenti of other differ , too . Here how the Vive compar with the Rift .The Vive system includ a pair of motion control for interact with object in virtual realiti and a camera embed in the front of the headset that let you peek into the real world . It also includ earbud for sound and two base station for detect motion . The comput must be bought separ .In contrast , the Rift includ a Microsoft Xbox game control and a remot control ; the compani delay the releas of it motion control until later thi year . For sound , the Rift headset ha headphon built into the side . An extern camera is use to detect your bodi . A comput can be bought as part of a bundl or separ .HTC recommend a comput with a power graphic card , like Nvidia GTX 970 or AMD R9 290 . It also recommend a power processor , such as Intel i5-4590 or AMD FX 8350 . You will also need four gigabyt of RAM and two display port .For the Rift , Oculu recommend a similar setup : a comput with the same Nvidia or AMD graphic card and Intel processor . It requir eight gigabyt of RAM and four USB port .If all those number were overwhelm , Valv and Oculu offer tool for check whether your comput is readi for the Vive or the Rift .The Rift wa releas with about 30 game and a few app . HTC said the Vive wa releas with about 50 game . The compani will regularli updat their librari with new app and game .The main advantag of the HTC Vive headset is that it come with motion control , which let you effect reach out and grab object in virtual realiti . Thi kind of interact feel much more natur for virtual realiti than the game control includ with the Rift .Also , the Vive motion-sens base station captur richer movement , enabl peopl to walk around in a larger space or crouch and grab someth while use virtual realiti ; the Rift camera can detect movement , too , but the Rift wa primarili design to be use while stand or sit .Anoth benefit of the Vive is that the headset fit better . With the Rift , I could alway see a small gap in the space beneath the nose . The Vive headset complet block the outsid world . HTC also includ a piec of foam that can be insert into the Vive for a better fit for a narrow face .But a major downsid of the Vive is the setup , which is more demand than the Rift . HTC recommend that you drill mount into the ceil to instal the motion-sens base station to ensur that the sensor have a clear line of sight with the headset and your bodi . In other word , to take full advantag of the Vive , you probabl need to dedic a room to virtual realiti ; to use the Rift , you can get away with clear out a bit of stand space .The other obviou downsid of the Vive is the higher cost . With a comput and accessori includ in the total price , the Vive will cost roughli $ 300 more than the Rift . Then again , if you are will to spend more than $ 1,000 for virtual realiti , that extra $ 300 might not matter much .Thi is Year 1 of power and capabl virtual realiti system come to the mainstream . Over time , the content that will becom avail for these devic will defin their worth . There isnt much to do with either system yet , and consum would be wise to wait to see if ani killer virtual realiti app or game emerg for the system .Gamer should keep an eye on anoth import virtual realiti headset : Sony PlayStat VR , which is schedul for releas in Octob . The headset will cost $ 399 ; when combin with the price of a PlayStat 4 and other accessori , the total cost of a PlayStat VR system will be roughli $ 800 .

And the polit climat is onli ad to the uncertainti , as Germani deal with a wave of migrant and a potenti exit of Britain from the European Union .Against that backdrop , the country export engin is sputter , while busi confid is erod .Dure the good time , the German manufactur Eickhoff Bergbautechnik sold 20 machin a year as China dug ever more coal mine to feed it energy-hungri factori . The machin , shearer loader that use giant spin claw to scrape coal or potash from underground seam , sell for up to 4 million euro , or about $ 4.6 million apiec .Last year , the compani sold just eight .

Due to the weight of thi market , it big volum for us and it important.The chang econom pictur also threaten to undercut the influenc of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germani .The country financi strength ha made it the domin polit power . Though protest in Greec were known to burn effigi of Ms. Merkel over her harsh auster polici , she help impos a measur of disciplin among bicker eurozon leader .But there ha been a tonal shift in recent month .Austria and other countri have defi Ms. Merkel wish on how to handl the influx of refuge from Syria .

It ha been more difficult for Berlin to herd the cats.Dure the last decad , Germani ha been someth of a shop mall for develop countri . If a countri wa mechan it farm , German compani like Claa made the tractor and grain harvest . If a countri need a factori to produc liquid oxygen or one to bottl beer , German compani like Lind or Krone could design , equip and build the whole plant .Soar demand from China , as well as place like Russia , Brazil and Kazakhstan , made Germani nearli impervi to the woe of it neighbor . While more than one-fifth of the work forc in Spain is jobless , German unemploy ha fallen to onli 4.3 percent , lower than that of the Unit State . When Eickhoff , the mine compani , had to lay off worker , mani of them found job at sister compani .China ha been particularli good to German automak , and therefor to the whole countri . Auto are Germany biggest export and one of the most import sourc of job . China last year becam the biggest market for the German sport car maker Porsch , surpass the Unit State for the first time .But there are sign of troubl . Growth in the Chines auto market is expect to be around 4 percent thi year , half what it wa last year .

It may be Hong Kong , and it may be onli one campaign , but compani should be fear .That the word activ and BlackRock are mention togeth is deep with symbol . BlackRock ha histor shi away from openli challeng compani . Inde , Laurenc D. Fink , BlackRock chairman and chief execut , ha becom a thought leader in the pushback against what he term short-term activ . Onli in Februari , Mr. Fink wrote to hundr of chief execut to warn against what he term short-term activ like share buyback and dividend , call on them instead to focu on long-term valu creation.Illustr of BlackRock reput as the pro-compani asset manag , one of it own sharehold is propos a proxi resolut to forc the asset manag to be more openli confront about the execut pay at the compani held in it funds portfolio . The sharehold contend that BlackRock proxi vote behavior is inconsist with long-term . From Juli 2014 to June 2015 , BlackRock fund vote ye in 99 percent of sharehold say on pay vote for compani in the Standard & Poor 500-stock index , higher than the 90 percent averag support for such vote at other fund compani .So the battl over G-Resourc is signific becaus it may be a sign of thing to come .G-Resourc is a compani list in Hong Kong but organ under the law of Bermuda . It wa form to develop the Martab gold mine in Indonesia . The road ha been bumpi for the compani as the price of gold ha fluctuat . But there wa never ani doubt that gold wa it main busi with perhap a sidelin in silver . Onli two year ago , G-Resourc rais $ 156 million to bolster it work capit and focu on develop the mine .G-Resources life as a mine compani end in Novemb 2015 , when it agre to sell the mine to a consortium led by EMR Capit , the hedg fund Farallon Capit and two Indonesian investor for $ 775 million . EMR is a privat equiti firm focus on natur resourc invest . It chairman is Owen Hegarti , who is also perhap not-so-coincident the execut vice chairman of G-Resourc . The price of the mine wa basic at it net asset valu , which is a common way to price gold mine .It wa not a gangbust price , but money wa actual not the sourc of thi disput , nor wa Mr. Hegarty involv .BlackRock activ aros out of G-Resource pledg to live beyond the sale of it main asset . Instead of distribut the proce of the sale to G-Resourc sharehold , the compani announc that it would use the money to enter into the princip investment and financi services busi . The member of the manag team , hire to run a gold mine , would continu in offic , now readi to be financi compani execut .One might expect thi maneuv to rais sharehold eyebrow . Whi would a gold manag team be qualifi to build a financ compani from scratch ? Even if thi were a wonder qualifi manag team for thi task , G-Resourc sharehold presum invest in a gold mine compani to gain exposur to the asset .In an age when conglomer are dead , it is hard to see a compani pivot in thi manner . I havent seen a maneuv like thi sinc the day of the Internet bubbl when the Zapata Corpor , a fish oil compani , chang it name to Zapata and announc it wa sell it busi and enter the Internet , bid on Excit . The stock rose 98 percent in one day .It here where BlackRock step in . Accord to Standard & Poor CapitalIQ , BlackRock collect own 9.2 percent of G-Resourc .Becaus thi wa a sale of almost all of G-Resources asset , the compani need sharehold approv to sell the mine .With a vote loom , BlackRock set itself up as a typic activist . It creat a websit and wrote a letter . Then BlackRock campaign against thi acquisit , make the pretti reason point that it had invest in G-Resourc in 2009 to invest in a gold mine . BlackRock also complain that G-Resourc ha not provid adequ disclosur and explan to sharehold on it chang of strategi ,  as well as even detail on how fund from the sale of the mine will be use effectively.BlackRock fought a typic activist campaign , lobbi sharehold . The two largest proxi advisori servic , Institut Sharehold Servic and Glass Lewi , recommend against the same transact . Although , becaus the proxi advisori servic tend to work with their client  the institut sharehold  and BlackRock is the biggest , the recommend wa not a surpris .BlackRock wa a first-tim loser , though . At the time of the meet , Pru Bennett , who head BlackRock Asia-Pacif busi and led the campaign , state that G-Resources busi wa opaque and BlackRock need to act pursuant to it fiduciari duties. It didnt work . Last month , 59 percent of G-Resourc vote sharehold vote ye , while 41 percent vote no .BlackRock most like got all of the outsid institut sharehold on it side , but still it lost . Thi is the peril of stock ownership outsid the Unit State . Mani compani have a sharehold base that is less activist focus .Still , manag appear chasten . In comment made at the meet , the execut director , Hui Richard Rui state that the compani would consid pay out part of the sale proce as a dividend , a direct appeal to BlackRock .BlackRock ha run it first signific activist campaign , and that mean someth . Activist , howev short- or long-termist , have beaten an extrem well-worn path for how to influenc compani .That BlackRock is use that path show how worn it is ; BlackRock is now will to challeng manag openli when the line is cross .BlackRock move also mean someth for sharehold activ itself . In the 1980 , privat equiti aros from nowher to becom one of the most treasur asset class .But is sharehold activ an asset class or just a way of life ? With low barrier to entri , almost anyon can do it . That thi activ took place in Hong Kong show that activ through institut sharehold is like to have a greater global effect than hedg fund activ , which need more liquid market to function and is often look for a quick hit .But the real key is whether institut investor simpli decid to cut out the middleman and start do their own activ . For now , G-Resourc is an outlier with a clear case . But the like futur is for institut investor to becom the activist themselv throughout the world .And so , thi seem like onli a singl case , but BlackRock is bound to do more .

The trader sought to influenc the rate in their favor for deriv trade they had enter into , Mr. Hine said .As an exampl , Mr. Hine said , one trader wrote in an email that our deal ha a big posit . Wer veri much in favor of a crazi high Libor setting.On anoth day , a trader wrote in a differ email that he want a Libor submitt to smash it . Have him set it low.At the time , Barclay wa one of 16 bank that provid submiss each day regard Libor as it relat to the dollar .Mr. Mathew and the other Barclay submitt did their best to ensur their request were carri out ,  Mr. Hine said .It the rate at which you can borrow money ,  Mr. Hine said . It not which rate suit our trade today.Mr. Hine said that the evid would show that Mr. Contogoula had even tri to influenc the rate after he left Barclay and went to anoth bank .So far , British prosecutor have had mix result in their effort to pursu crimin charg in the Libor matter .Mr. Hay , the former UB and Citigroup trader , wa convict in August of crimin charg relat to the manipul of Libor .

He offer enorm tax cut , as ani bona fide Republican candid must . But he also want to leav Social Secur a it is.He say he hate Obamacar , but offer concept of Medicare to care for peopl that cant take care of themselves. He ha gut the standard Republican posit that favor freer trade .The most surpris aspect about Mr. Trump solid appeal among Republican primari voter , though , may be what it say about the wane place of religion in American polit and the reviv of a popul center more on econom nation and white working-class discont .It is intrigu that we have some notabl challeng to the polit establish that are not come from a tradit American religi place but from a surprisingli secular tradit ,  said David Voa , head of the social scienc depart at Univers Colleg London .Is thi a sign that American are final lose their religi spirit , follow the longtim trend in other advanc nation ? At the veri least , it doe suggest that Republicans longstand strategi of build major for their anti-tax platform by appeal to working-class voters Christian moral ha lost a lot of it power .Donald Trump is not just the least religi Republican in the field , he is perceiv as less religi than Hillari Clinton or even Berni Sander , who clearli resembl a secular European social democrat .Given Mr. Trump serial marriag , the coars sexual refer and hi multipl posit on abort , it no surpris that fewer than half of Republican view him as religi , accord to a poll by the Pew Research Center thi year .And still , hi econom popul , reminisc of the nationalist stanc of European right-wing like Silvio Berlusconi of Itali , ha so far overpow the openli devout messag of Ted Cruz , the most deep-di conserv still in the race . Inde , Mr. Trump ha outflank the standard bearer of the tradit religi right even among the most devout voter .American remain except religi , compar to peopl in other rich nation . American scholar argu thi is larg becaus the sharp line between church and state in the Unit State foster vibrant competit among differ religi flavor , which kept the flame aliv .But religion appeal ha been erod in the Unit State sinc the end of the 1980 , accord to research by Michael Hout of New York Univers and Claud Fischer of the Univers of California , Berkeley . In 1987 , onli one in 14 American adult express no religi prefer . By 2012 , the share had increas to one in five .Scholar like Professor Voa argu American are undergo a process similar to what ha happen in Europ , where secular institut took over mani of the job onc perform by the church . Professor Hout and Fischer argu , instead , that the eros reflect the shock and aftershock from the 1960 : like churches censureship of premarit sex and young people grow accept of homosexu .Organ religion gain influenc by espous a conserv social agenda that led liber and young peopl who alreadi had weak attach to organ religion to drop that identif ,  they wrote . By 2012 , 36 percent of liber prefer no religion , compar to just 7 percent of conserv .Regardless of the deeper dynam , Mr. Trump campaign pose a critic question : Is the align of interest on the right , entwin religi fervor with free market econom , fray ? If so , what will take it place ?The notion that evangel voter are nonrespons to anyth other than abort and homosexu overst the power of religion on polit choic ,  said Nolan McCarti , professor of polit and public affair at Princeton .Republicans longstand strategi ha been show sign of wear for a while . By 2012 , Professor Hout argu , it wa clear that they had pretti much gotten as much as they were go to get out of religion. They couldnt expand the base ani further by appeal to devout Christian , he said , becaus they had round them up already.Still , it took Mr. Trump to identifi the real Achilles heel in the Reagan coalit : an econom polici built around tax cut for the wealthi that ha fail to deliv the good to the Republican base for far too long .While Mr. Trump econom propos may not add up to a coher agenda for most voter , it doe suggest , said Kenneth Scheve , a professor of polit scienc at Stanford , that there is someth wrong in the polici bundl Republican have offer them over and over again.Mr. Trump may not be abl to ride hi coalit to the White Hous ( he ha alien too mani women and Hispan , among other ) . But he ha probabl chang American polit for good . And that call for more polici experiment to address directli the trauma of the work class .I cant see the rhetor of small govern go away ,  Professor Scheve said . But some Republican might tri includ support for social insur as a strategy.He compar the posit of contemporari Republican to that of British Conserv after their devast polit defeat at the end of World War II , when they accept the legitimaci of a social safeti net . The Tori at some point said thi is the way democrat capit work ,  Professor Scheve said .Democrat , of cours , have not been abl to carri out an econom agenda that unit working-class white with minor constitu , either .All that suggest that the 2016 elect is emerg as one that potenti lead to a major realign of polit allegi , much as the elect of 1968 did . Then , Lyndon Johnson desegreg polici push Southern white from the Democrat Parti into the arm of Republican , who built a long-last polit coalit around resent over the rise of racial and ethnic minor .Mr. Trump nake appeal to those resent is like to come up short . So where will the next major come from ?The new win coalit is up for grab ,  Professor Hout said . It doesnt seem to have a big place for religion , though .They cant win without them ,  Professor Hout ad , speak of Republican and their Christian support .

Much larger debt payment , total about $ 2 billion , are due from other branch of the govern on Juli 1 .', 'Pfizer plan to abandon it $ 152 billion merger with Allergan  the largest deal yet aim at help an American compani shed it Unit State corpor citizenship for a lower tax bill  just day after the Obama administr introduc new tax rule , a person brief on the matter said late Tuesday .The two drug compani could announc their decis to termin the deal as soon as Wednesday morn , accord to thi person , who wa not author to speak publicli .The decis is a victori for the Obama administr , which introduc the initi as part of an effort to thwart the abil of compani to move incom oversea , beyond the reach of the Unit State .The propos regul , announc on Monday by the Treasuri Depart , appear specif to target Pfizer and Allergan , which ha it tax domicil in Ireland . Still , tax expert said that other transact would also be affect .When Pfizer and Allergan announc their deal in Novemb , they knew that the Obama administr would take aim at it . But the compani and their advis were stun when the Treasuri Depart took highli aggress step in remov mani of the tax benefit of the merger .Advis for the two compani spent much of Tuesday weigh their option . But mani analyst and legal expert conclud that fight the Treasuri Depart would be costli , with littl guarante of success .In walk away from the plan transact becaus of chang in tax rule , Pfizer would have to pay Allergan , the maker of Botox and other drug , up to $ 400 million , accord to the merger agreement between the two compani .CNBC earlier report the decis to termin the deal .Previou rule chang by the Treasuri Depart have kill some propos invers , like the drug maker AbbVie plan $ 54 billion takeov of it Irish counterpart Shire . But they had otherwis done littl to stem a rise tide of American compani seek foreign acquisit to reduc their tax rate .The rule announc on Monday by the Treasuri , howev , were seen as much more aggress and expans , and they sent shock wave up and down Wall Street .Start on Monday night , lawyer at big firm have been camp out in confer room studi how the new rule would affect their client . While expert were still weigh the overal impact , so far they have suggest that the hundr of pages worth of regul would have an incred expans reach and would even affect foreign compani with huge American oper , includ the parent of Mercedes-Benz and Nestl .These rule are go to appli much more broadli than peopl had expect ,  said Stephen L. Gordon , the head of the tax depart at the law firm Cravath , Swain & Moor .Chief among the target of the Obama administr , howev , ha been corpor invers , in which American compani buy foreign competitor and move their corpor home oversea in an effort to pay fewer tax in the Unit State . Some 40 compani have struck invers over the past five year , accord to data from Dealog .Presid Obama said on Tuesday that the new rule would help prevent one of the most insidi tax loophol out there , flee the countri just to get out of pay their taxes.Still , even the new rule will not complet elimin way that compani can technic invert  one lawyer describ tax avoid as a game of Whac-a-Mol until Congress overhaul the overal tax code . But they signal the Obama administration intent to hit on corpor tax as the issu ha gain steam on the presidenti campaign trail .Perhap the most obviou symbol of that fight ha been Pfizer , the blue-chip drug maker that produc painkil dure the Civil War and penicillin dure World War II . Execut at the pharmaceut maker have made no secret of their belief that renounc it corpor citizenship and lower it overal tax bill were their duti as steward to sharehold .After tri and fail to buy British rival AstraZeneca two year ago , Pfizer final found it ticket to an oversea corpor passport in Allergan , a drug maker base in Dublin but built in larg part through acquisit of American compani .Allergan began it invers path in Octob 2013 , when it wa then known as Actavi , and bought Warner Chilcott for $ 8.5 billion , which enabl the combin compani to move to Ireland . From there , Actavi acquir New York-bas Forest Laboratori in Juli 2014 for $ 28 billion . The follow year , Actavi took over the Botox maker Allergan for $ 70.5 billion , take the latter name .By the time Allergan wa readi to negoti it biggest deal yet , it had a market cap of about $ 100 billion , make it a more fit counterpart for Pfizer , under the rule from 2015 . Though their plan deal is not technic an invers , sinc it is Allergan that is the buyer in the transact , the move would accomplish the same goal .It is that string of previou acquisit that is a focal point of the new Treasuri Depart rule . The administr had a name for foreign compani that bulk up by buy American one for tax advantag : serial inverters. The new rule aim to restrict them by disregard the valu of the American busi acquir over the last three year .It funni how the rule happen to almost fit perfectli with thi deal ,  said Kevin Kedra , an analyst at Gabelli & Compani , refer to Pfizer and Allergan . It would be easi to argu that not coincid . I would think it certainli seem direct toward derail thi specif deal.In respons to the new rule , Allergan share declin almost 15 percent on Tuesday , while . Pfizer share gain about 2 percent .A Treasuri spokeswoman said that the regul declin to comment on specif deal and wa address the issu more broadli .It is import to note we are onli awar of publicli avail inform and do not have ani insight into specif transact ,  the spokeswoman said . Our action were base on our gener understand of abus practic , not on ani specif transaction.There is perhap less of a probabl that Treasury new rule will derail ani of the other six invers deal that are still pend , accord to analyst , includ Canada-bas Progress Wast Solutions acquisit of Wast Connect and Johnson Controls merger with Irish-bas Tyco .Share in those four compani declin on Tuesday , larg on concern about lose some of their tax benefit .Progress Wast and Wast Connect said in a statement that it expect the new rule to have limit effect on the financi aspect of it merger and remain commit to the deal .And a spokesman for Johnson Control said , Wer review the Treasuri regul , but wer not go to specul at thi time what , if ani , impact it will have on the propos merger with Tyco.In addit to target serial invert , the Treasuri Depart also took aim at so-cal earn strip . Thi techniqu is use not just by invert compani but by mani multin . It involv make the American subsidiari borrow from the foreign parent compani . That give the Unit State busi interest payment they can deduct from earn . Becaus the loan is within the compani , the cost is not reflect on financi statement .Treasury way of clamp down on earn strip is to treat that debt as stock , effect get rid of the interest payment altogeth . Without the interest payment , the Unit State subsidiari would be tax on the full basi of their Unit State earn .Though Pfizer and Allergan deal wa less affect by earn strip , the potenti consequ of the new Treasuri rule could go well beyond corpor invers , accord to tax expert .To me , the earn strip part of thi is quit clearli the most signific of the chang theyv put out ,  said Stephen E. Shay , a senior lectur at Harvard Law School and former deputi assist secretari for intern tax affair in the Treasuri Depart .Some analyst question whether the Treasuri Depart had the author to enact it latest propos rule . The administr drew in part upon an expans read of the tax code as the basi for the regul , though a few expert call that move into question .We are surpris , to say the least , that Treasuri took the drastic step of propos such a punit rule , appar without the author to do so ,  Robert Willen , an independ tax consult , wrote in a note to client on Tuesday .Still , ani legal challeng to the Treasuri Department new rule could potenti take year  with no guarante of victori .There are conceiv way in which the deal could still happen if Pfizer and Allergan were to legal challeng these rule in court ,  said Mr. Kedra at Gabelli . Given the time and uncertainti of that process , it probabl a low-prob event.', 'LO ANGEL  Wev had the Squar Deal , the Fair Deal and the New Deal .Now , Billi Nungess , who ha been the lieuten governor of Louisiana sinc Januari , is ponder what could be call the Reel Deal .With the state substanti film and televis product incent under pressur becaus of a budget crisi that arriv with fall oil price , Mr. Nungess is propos a novel approach : Louisiana will extend the incent in return for a promis that taxpay will share in the profit from ani big winner at the box offic .I cant think of ani good argument against it ,  said Mr. Nungess , who float hi proposit  at thi point , just a trial balloon  in a telephon interview thi week .Other are not so sure .It would creat a financi proposit that would not be competit with other state and countri ,  Van Stevenson , the senior vice presid for state govern affair at the Motion Pictur Associ of America , also speak by phone , said of Mr. Nungesser suggest .Mr. Nungesser propos is a simpl , but radic , one .It appear that none of the approxim three dozen state offer tax credit and other financi incent to the film industri ask for what even the lowlier Hollywood writer and produc routin get : some particip in receipt or profit , if onli in the form of what old hand call sucker points. Those are key to net profit , and they are defin by term so restrict they are like to pay onli on the most enorm of hit .Louisiana , which spend up to $ 180 million annual on movi and televis incent , ha alreadi wit the power of a global blockbust . Under a program that current underwrit about 30 percent of qualifi expens on a film , with a number of restrict and limit , the state paid part of the $ 150 million or more than it cost to make Jurass World.Releas by Univers Pictur in 2015 , the film went on to collect more than $ 1.67 billion in worldwid ticket sale .But Louisiana taxpay receiv onli the benefit that typic come with product incent : ad job , increas local spend , enhanc tourist cachet and so forth .Mr. Nungess , who overse a state tourism offic that face possibl budget cut of 30 percent , figur taxpay might toler continu spend on film product if they saw a chanc to share Hollywood wealth .It like drill oil well ,  he said . If one in 30 make it , your go to get your money back.Of cours , noth is quit that easi where the entertain busi  never mind Louisiana polit  is concern .An immedi hurdl , note Mr. Stevenson of the M.P.A.A. , is other state govern , includ those of California , New York , Pennsylvania and Georgia , that might still offer subsidi without demand a piec of the action .Anoth complic involv the polit landscap in Louisiana , where Mr. Nungess , a Republican , serv under Gov . John Bel Edward , a Democrat , and where both must work with a Legislatur with a Republican major .Onli recent , the former Republican governor , Bobbi Jindal , led a success effort to cap film subsidi at $ 180 million a year , after have paid $ 250 million in credit dure 2014 . Even as Louisiana wa expand it incent program in 2008 , some in govern felt sticker shock at the price tag for high-profil film like the Brad Pitt vehicl , The Curiou Case of Benjamin Button ,  for which taxpay were bill more than $ 27 million .One of the next major film receiv incent from Louisiana is Deepwat Horizon ,  star Mark Wahlberg . The movi is about the 2010 oil spill that pollut the Gulf of Mexico , and much of Plaquemin Parish , where Mr. Nungess wa parish presid . It releas by Lionsgat and it Summit Entertain unit in Septemb will find Louisiana support a movi that highlight the inher risk of it alreadi hard-press oil industri .Deepwat Horizon could make thing stickier for Mr. Nungess . But Governor Edward , he said , ha express willing to join him in explor long-term fix to the incent program , includ , perhap , hi preliminari propos that Hollywood share at least part of it profit .Wev got to give the taxpay a comfort level , that it a good invest ,  Mr. Nungess said .Im passion about make that happen.', 'Lawyer for the ail media mogul Sumner M.

It also would prevent a judg from decid on the compet of Mr. Redston , which could have set off success plan for hi control stake in Viacom and CB .The legal battl had all the make of a spectacl that both side most like want to avoid .On one side wa Mr. Redston , the onetim ruthless and color businessman who continu to hold a control stake in a $ 40 billion entertain empir that includ Viacom and CB . He ha not been seen publicli sinc hi 92nd birthday parti last May and , although he wa repres by a team of lawyer , did not make an appear or ani public declar of hi own dure the cours of the legal proceed .On the other side wa Manuela Herzer , Mr. Redstone former companion and romant partner .

It includ sever embarrass detail about what Ms. Herzer describ as hi sexual appetit , hi incontin and hi demand to eat steak while on a feed tube .She said she wa concern about hi health and well-b , but lawyer for Mr. Redston call the suit meritless and said Ms. Herzer wa motiv by greed .

He had plan to leav her $ 50 million and hi $ 20 million Lo Angel mansion .Also swept into the drama were Mr. Redstone daughter , Shari Redston , and Philipp P. Dauman , the chief execut of Viacom . Ms. Herzer claim that Ms. Redston unduli influenc her father . Mr. Dauman replac Ms. Herzer as the person in charg of Mr. Redstone health care plan and had been schedul to give a deposit in the case on Tuesday .While the judg overse the case said that medic record of Mr. Redston were to remain confidenti , ani evid introduc dure the trial could have been made public .A settlement would allow the parti to avoid the public exposur and negoti term that could be mutual benefici to both side rather than leav the final determin of the case up to Judg David J. Cowan of the Lo Angel Counti Superior Court , who is overse the trial . No detail of the negoti were disclos , but it is like that a settlement will includ money as well as plan for Mr. Redstone care .News emerg on Tuesday that Ms. Redston wa name to a direct that would put her in charg of her father health care , accord to two peopl with knowledg of the situat .

In a Februari rule , Judg Cowan decid that the case would go to trial becaus of a plethora of disput factual issues about Mr. Redstone mental capac and medic care .At that time , the judg also rais concern about who  if anyon  wa look after Mr. Redston . He question whether the relationship between Mr. Redston and hi daughter wa as smooth as she had describ in a court file . He also said that it wa perplex that Mr. Redston had name Mr. Dauman as hi health care agent rather than hi own daughter .News of the settlement talk wa first report by The Wall Street Journal .Though the legal drama concern Mr. Redstone privat life , it put a sharp focu on success plan and the broader fate of Viacom and CB . In the face of question over hi mental capac and concern about corpor govern , Mr. Redston step down as execut chairman of the two compani in Februari .

The new guidanc also revis and complet rule the Treasuri had previous propos in 2014 and 2015 .The propos regul are more aggress and expans than the Treasury earlier volley , ventur into at least two area where it legal author seem like to be challeng .The first area relat to what the Treasuri refer to as multistep acquisit .In Section 7874 of the tax code , Congress ha set out statutori hurdl that compani must clear to achiev the tax benefit . Simplifi somewhat , if the sharehold of a foreign acquir own less than 20 percent of the combin entiti after the acquisit , then the tax code simpli disregard the acquisit for purpos of determin the resid of the combin entiti . The purport invers fail .If the sharehold of a foreign acquir own more than 20 percent but less than 40 percent of the combin entiti , and the foreign acquir conduct substanti busi activ in the foreign jurisdict , then the invers technic work .The rule subject the expatri Unit State corpor to a tax on appreci asset , among other unapp consequ , but mani compani are will to stomach the short-term pain for long-term gain .If the sharehold of the foreign acquir own more than 40 percent of the combin entiti , the invers work and most of the neg consequ are avoid . Similarli , inbound foreign acquisit ( where the foreign acquir is larger than the domest target ) avoid the reach of Section 7874 .These numer guidepost are in the tax code and are thought to constrain the Treasury legal author . In the guidanc issu in 2014 and 2015 , the Treasuri nibbl around the edg , shut down the abil of compani to skinni down the Unit State entiti or fatten up the foreign acquir to clear the statutori hurdl .The guidanc issu Monday goe further , effect count domest acquisit by an invert acquir within the last three year as an impermiss fattening-up . If the valu of those previou acquisit is disregard , the foreign acquir becom smaller and subject to more stringent invers rule .The guidanc on multistep acquisit relat to a new trend that wa hard to predict in advanc : Mani invert compani have prove to be recidivist . After an invers , the invert corpor then becom the acquir of American compani in new invers transact .Im not sure if the new guidanc will surviv a legal challeng . It is hardli unusu for tax rule to disregard the form of a transact in favor of it econom substanc . Multistep transact are often step together and treat as a singl transact for tax purpos .But it would be unusu to step togeth transact that occur over a period of year , each of which had independ legal and econom substanc and signific , in the absenc of evid of a plan to complet the seri of transact . The Treasury legal author is broad , and the polici defens , but it not a layup .A second area of controversi relat to earnings-strip , a common techniqu where multin corpor use interest payment or other transfer to shift incom out of the high-tax Unit State into a low-tax jurisdict like Ireland or the Cayman Island .The guidanc take a swipe at earnings-strip , employ legal author that ha lain dormant for nearli 50 year . In 1969 , Congress author the Treasuri to issu regul distinguish between debt and equiti , under Section 385 of the tax code .Some tax expert consid Section 385 to be dead letter , supersed by more recent , specif limit on interest deduct .When Stephen Shay , a professor at Harvard Law School , propos that the Treasuri use it author under Section 385 to curb earnings-strip in the context of invers , some lobbyist respond by question whether ani attempt to do so would surviv a legal challeng .The earnings-strip guidanc is not limit to invers . Rather , it final tackl a problem that ha plagu intern tax polici for year and account for a great deal of the eros of the corpor tax base . In my view , thi strengthen the Treasury case against a legal challeng .It could be year befor a court decid whether the Treasuri ha the legal author it claim , but thousand of larg corpor will have to review complex multin structur to sort out how the rule appli to them .Tax lawyer can expect a busi summer .', 'Q.

The facad of Thoma Edison last factori in thi town crumbl behind a chain-link fenc on Main Street . The dilapid build sit on sever acr of fallow land , a sharp contrast to it state in 1914 , when it wa just one piec of the American inventor formid manufactur oper .In the last few week , worker have begun restor the 400,000-square-foot Edison Storag Batteri factori , the first step in a $ 230 million redevelop project . Call Edison Villag , it is intend to transform 21 acr in thi New York Citi suburb into a neighborhood with shop , park and hous .The start of construct bring a decad of setback to a close , despit linger concern from some resid that the project might not deliv on it promis of renew .West Orang , with 46,700 resid spread over 12.5 squar mile , is about 20 mile from Manhattan . The first phase of the project will creat about 330 rental apart and bring 18,500 squar feet of retail space , as well as park and streetscap improv to the complex . The site is opposit Edison laboratori , which is now part of the Thoma Edison Nation Histor Park , where visitor can tour hi home in nearbi Llewellyn Park and learn about hi invent .The second phase , with about 230 townhous and 20,000 squar feet of retail , which could includ a small groceri store , accord to the develop , will replac a CV pharmaci and a Barton Press factori about a block from the batteri factori .Thi is a big opportun for the downtown to see some rebirth ,  said West Orange mayor , Robert D. Parisi . Old downtown are struggl to surviv in a modern world.The town adopt a redevelop plan for the area in 2003 , and design a redevelop , Prism Capit Partner of Bloomfield , N.J. , three year later . The origin plan to build condo wa derail by the recess . The project hit anoth roadblock in 2012 , when five West Orang resid file a lawsuit challeng the town decis to issu $ 6.3 million of municip bond to financ infrastructur improv .Last Decemb , the State Suprem Court upheld a lower-court rule in favor of the town , clear a path for redevelop to begin . And in Februari , Prism secur a $ 70 million construct loan .Like mani older American suburb , West Orang struggl to draw visitor to it age downtown . It Main Street wind along a mile-and-a-half-long stretch of hous , municip build and offic interspers with pocket of disconnect retail . It make for an unwieldi stroll .The plan critic oppos use public money to financ a privat develop that might not deliv suffici revenu to a middle-class commun burden with high properti tax . An influx of new resid could strain public school and worsen traffic on a congest arteri , they say .I shudder to think about the impact of a fail project ,  said Joe Krakoviak , a member of the town council and a critic of the plan .Edison Village detractor argu that the approv process wa opaqu , leav question about the viabil of the plan . Among the concern are that Edison Villag is not within walk distanc of a train station , unlik similar project in other New Jersey suburb , and that the nearest stop for a bu to Manhattan is about a half-mil walk . Prism , though , say it plan to offer shuttl servic to a train station .In it prime , the area around the factori , at Main Street and Lakesid Avenu , wa a center of industri , not retail . At it peak , 10,000 worker toil in dozen of build here . Around 850 of them work in the four batteri factori build , which made batteri for industri use like submarin and mine lamp .Mani resid still tell me stori about their grandfath who work for Edison ,  said Joseph Fagan , a local historian . Edison help place West Orang on the map.But by the 1960 , mani of the American inventor busi had been spun off . The busi slowli fail , said Leonard DeGraaf , an archivist at the Thoma Edison Nation Histor Park . That had an enorm impact on the commun ,  he said . In the earli 1970 , the factori were raze , except for the batteri complex , which wa ad to the Nation Regist of Histor Place in 1996 .Mr. Parisi , who grew up near the factori and still live in the neighborhood , rememb gather with neighbor on the street as a young boy to watch the build implod . For day afterward , he and hi friend climb through the rubbl , scour for remnant of Edison invent and find some of the wax cylind that had been use for phonograph .Edison Villag , with ground open to the public dure the day , is intend to usher into the downtown the new era of the American urban center . New retail will open in about a year and a half , bring coffe shop and restaur to a drab block that face an auto bodi shop , a bar and some hous .The Edison factori , which will hous nearli all of the apart , will open in about two and a half year . Plan build renov includ restor the facad and replac the roughli 800 window that wrap around the build , offer view of the neighbor brick laboratori and , in the distanc , the New York Citi skylin .The complex will have a pool , a fit center and 20 penthous duplex apart . Ask rent for the loftlik apart could start around $ 1,600 a month for a studio and $ 2,600 for a two-bedroom . Streetscap improv will add light , replac sidewalk and move util pole .

It breed confid for peopl to take chances.Still , some resid are skeptic of the deal , particularli the decis to issu municip bond to financ the infrastructur work . Under a 30-year tax-altern agreement , the mayor estim that the town could receiv as much as $ 1.188 million a year in payment from Prism , but onli after the first phase of the develop is fulli occupi . At a minimum , it would receiv $ 650,000 a year . The town now collect $ 465,683 in properti tax for the Edison site , Mr. Parisi said . A tax agreement ha not yet been reach for the second phase of the project .Critic argu that the payment arrang amount to a substanti tax break for a project that will bring new resid who could strain school and infrastructur . Properti tax are alreadi high . Last year , the averag residenti tax bill wa roughli $ 13,000 , and the averag home valu wa about $ 338,000 .The taxpay should not be subsid these guy ,  said Mark Meyerowitz , a plaintiff in the lawsuit against the town . It just a bad deal for the citizen of West Orange.Mr. Parisi said he expect that the develop would not draw a larg number of famili with school-ag children , argu that such develop tend to appeal to young profession and empti nester . As for traffic , Ashland Avenu , a street that run parallel to Main Street , will be extend dure the second phase of the project , eas congest .Ultim , Mr. Parisi see the altern  leav a hulk eyesor in the middl of town  as the greater risk . The goal ,  he said , wa to revit a neighborhood.

Malone Liberti Media . Mr. Malon , known for hi deal make , ha spoken publicli about what he see as the need for consolid of what he call free radicals in the media industri .Creat a stand-alon stream servic ha been a long time in the make for Chri Albrecht , who took over as chief execut of Starz in Januari 2010 .Previous , Mr. Albrecht wa the chief execut of HBO , where he help assembl a slate of signatur seri like The Soprano ,  The Wire and Sex and the City. Dure that time , he said , he start explor the idea of creat a lighter servic that HBO could sell directli to consum , outsid tradit cabl or satellit packag .I like to think it wa becaus I wa realli smart ,  he said , but he instead credit peopl he hire who knew about the space and thought about the way peopl are go to consum content.They said , Thi is someth that we should be do and we should be first ,  he recal .Other compani that are out there might not now exist if we had done that then ,  he ad , hint at the rise of Netflix and of Amazon stream servic .In 2007 , Mr. Albrecht wa forc out at HBO . When he arriv at Starz , about three year later , the idea to start a stream servic wa shelv . At the time , the compani wa own by Liberti Media .Starz had onli just start experi with origin program , with project like Parti Down and Spartacus. The flagship network at the time count about 17 million subscrib and had struck a program deal with Netflix that Mr. Albrecht describ as an albatross around our neck. That deal did a great job in help launch Netflix ,  he said .The compani ha chang significantli sinc then . In 2013 , Starz wa spun off from Liberti into an independ , publicli trade compani . It ha also rais it profil with critic acclaim program like Outland ,  base on the best-sel novel about a World War II-era British Armi nurs , and Power ,  produc by the rapper Curti Jackson , better known as 50 Cent , about a New York nightclub owner and drug kingpin .Starz now ha about 23.6 million subscrib , accord to SNL Kagan , slightli ahead of Showtime 23.4 million .

Those figur do not includ subscrib to their stream servic .Ami Yong , a media analyst with Macquari , said subscrib number were grow for Starz larg becaus cabl and satellit compani get big incent to sell it subscript .Starz is estim to captur about $ 4 a subscrib , with the rest of the subscript fee go to cabl and satellit compani .They are happi to be partner with cabl compani ,  Ms. Yong said , at a time when mani media compani find themselv in heat disput with cabl oper over right fee .Total revenu for the compani increas 2 percent in 2015 to $ 1.7 billion , with net incom down 12 percent to $ 237 million , primarili becaus of increas program and market cost . Analyst expect the expir of a program deal with Disney to deliv cost save in the futur .Despit the stride Starz ha made , it still suffer a percept problem compar with HBO and Showtim , whose show  like Game of Thrones and Homeland  can becom part of the cultur convers . Everyon know and recogn HBO , and consum can rattl off the last coupl of show on that network ,  Ms. Yong said . Starz still hasnt found that voic with the consum . They dont have ani recogniz hit , but they are get there.In Februari , the entertain compani Lionsgat said in a regulatori file that it had taken a stake in Starz and intend to explor a potenti acquisit of the compani . Yet a deal ha fail to materi . That , combin with broader anxieti about the role of tradit media in a digit world , ha led the company stock price to plung about 23 percent so far thi year .It is like they tie one of their leg to our , tie an anchor around the other leg and threw the anchor off the boat ,  Mr. Albrecht said .It wa certainli distress to see that and not a lot of fun sinc then ,  he ad . We can show the way that we can continu to evolv through the line of busi that we have , as well as creat new one . Wer go to show a compani that is worth invest in.One major focu is the new app , which offer download of most content and allow four peopl to stream simultan . Peopl who alreadi subscrib to Starz through a tradit pay TV provid also will be abl to use the app , which initi will be avail on Appl and Googl devic , with other futur partner expect .In a statement , an Appl spokeswoman said , A wev said , the futur of TV is app , and STARZ is anoth incred exampl of iO and Appl TV custom be abl to watch the show they love on their favorit devices.Starz origin seri attract viewer who are more racial divers and have lower averag incom than audienc of other premium TV network , accord to Nielsen data provid by the network . Mr. Albrecht said that the new app wa meant for viewer who are like to be interest in the network origin program but are price out of higher-cost premium TV network .Typic , cabl and satellit provid sell premium network like HBO , Showtim and Starz on top of subscript to standard cabl bundl .There is an opportun to differenti ourselv to a group of consum that would like be custom of Starz if they could access it ,  Mr. Albrecht said . Premium are stuck on top as a cherri last to be ad , first to come off.Inde , Starz will have much differenti to do . The debut of the network app come nearli a year after HBO introduc it $ 15-a-month HBO Now stream servic to much fanfar . Soon after , Showtim unveil a similar servic for $ 11 a month .

Congress is not expect to enact a law in time for the bank May 1 debt payment due date  or perhap not even by Juli 1 , when an even bigger payment from Puerto Rico is due .The hedg fund , which own Puerto Rico bond , base part of their lawsuit on a confidenti report by Puerto Rico Commission of Financi Institut , which in Novemb found the Govern Develop Bank insolv .In March , a feder judg quot promin from the commissioner confidenti report in decid a tax case , though the commissioner offic would not releas a copi .In that tax case , Walmart accus Puerto Rico of unlaw hit the retail with a higher tax rate last year than ani other busi on the island .

There were widespread predict that employ would leap at the chanc to drop coverag and send worker to fend for themselv .But those predict were larg wrong . Most compani , and particularli larg employ , that offer coverag befor the law have stay commit to provid health insur .As it turn out , health care remain an import recruit and retent tool as the labor market ha tighten in recent year . Desir employe still expect health benefit , and compani are respond , new analys of feder data show .Wer more confid than ever that well offer benefit ,  said Robert Ihri Jr. , a senior vice presid for Lowe Compani , the home improv retail .Compani get a sizabl feder tax break from provid the insur . And if they drop the coverag , mani worker would expect the money in their paycheck to increas enough to pay for outsid insur  or would look for a new job .The revers in think about employ benefit is so stark that even govern budget offici are sing an optimist tune . They lower the number of peopl they think will lose coverag becaus of the health law and now predict employ will remain the sourc of coverag for a major of work American for the next decad .The surpris turnaround add to an emerg consensu about the contenti health law : It ha not upturn the core of the country health insur system , even while insur million of low-incom peopl .The employer-bas system is aliv and well ,  said Jeff Alter , the chief execut of the commerci insur busi for UnitedHealthcar , one of the nation largest health insur compani . Even among critic of the law , includ the Republican presidenti candid , there ha been virtual no debat about employ coverag .About 155 million American have employer-bas health insur coverag in 2016 , accord to an analysi releas by the Congression Budget Offic last month . The number will fall to 152 million peopl in 2019 , the C.B.O . estim , but will remain stabl through 2026 . Slightli more than half of peopl under 65 will be enrol in employment-bas coverag .Employ seem to be stay the cours even more strongli than they did befor the law . The percentag of adult under 65 with employer-bas insur held firm for the last five year after steadili declin sinc 1999 , accord to an analysi of feder data releas last month by the Kaiser Famili Foundat , which close track the health insur market .The health plan employe get to choos from also look much the same as befor the law went into effect . The industri remain domin by familiar name , like nonprofit Blue Cross plan or for-profit compani like UnitedHealthcar and Anthem .Employ coverag is much more stabl than anyon anticip ,  said Larri Levitt , a senior execut at Kaiser .Compani say they are respond to the realiti of the labor market , but they also say the onlin marketplac where individu can more easili buy plan , a creation of the health care law , have not been an entic altern for worker .Employ may feel differ if the economi turn down and the labor market is less robust or if there is a sudden spike in health care cost . Becaus worker can no longer be deni an insur polici becaus of poor health , compani may be will to drop coverag under the right circumst , know that insur is more avail to everyon .But there are no plan for a mass exodu .The demis of employer-bas coverag wa definit overst ,  said Michael Thompson , the chief execut of the Nation Busi Coalit on Health , which repres employ and other buyer of insur .The steepest declin in coverag have been in small busi , which had been steadili drop coverag befor the law . The percentag of small employ offer health benefit decreas from 68 percent in 2010 to 56 percent in 2015 , accord to the annual Kaiser Famili Foundat survey .But those compani now seem less like to exit than just a few year ago . In 2013 , as mani as a fifth of employ with fewer than 500 worker said they were like to drop coverag in the next five year , compar with 7 percent today , accord to a survey from Mercer , the benefit consult .Traci Watt , a senior partner at Mercer , said the stabil at small busi wa mostli a product of their health care cost stay the same or rise onli modestli .That will keep you in the game ,  Ms. Watt said .The earli tumult in the insur marketplac , includ the troubl introduct of HealthCare.gov , the feder run insur marketplac for the Afford Care Act , also made drop coverag less tenabl , analyst said .The law ha result in more coverag for low-incom peopl , as expect . But the unexpect exit by some of the start-up insur ha limit option on the marketplac . And the plan on the exchang remain less gener than those offer by mani employ , with significantli higher deduct and a significantli narrow choic of hospit and network .Lowe , by comparison , said it ha tri to keep employe cost low by contribut about 70 percent of the cost of the annual premium . It offer plan with deduct as low as $ 1,000 , versu sever thousand dollar for mani of the exchang plan .The exchang have been less of a disrupt than I expect ,  said Thoma Buchmuel , a busi professor at the Univers of Michigan .Employ say there is less financi advantag to drop coverag than first thought . The law penal larg employ , about $ 2,000 per worker , when they do not offer health insur . That is far less than the averag cost of famili coverag , now $ 12,600 a year , accord to the Kaiser Famili Foundat .But those calcul do not figur in the sizabl tax break that come with provid coverag . In addit , if the employ do not provid insur , they would almost certainli be pressur  especi in a strong labor market  to add enough money to workers paycheck to cover the cost of buy insur on the marketplac .Some employ , particularli the smallest busi and those who employ low-incom worker elig for a subsidi , clearli favor move employe to the exchang . Other employ do not .The math realli work in favor of provid coverag ,  Mr. Thompson said .While the C.B.O . predict the employ market will be stabl until 2026 , 10 year is a long time and feder offici could be wrong .They are take their best guess , and I think it is a reason best guess ,  said Loren Adler , a health polici analyst at the Brook Institut in Washington . I wouldnt take it as gospel.If the cost of provid coverag spike , as it did through much of the late 1990 and earli 2000 , employ might start talk about drop coverag again , Mr. Adler said . Congress could also take step to diminish the tax prefer for employer-provid insur .But so far , employ like Mr. Ihri of Lowe say they do not feel compel to chang .Peopl have conclud ,  he said , that it better to stay where we are.', 'Mark P.

He said he support punish women for abort and then walk it back ; hi campaign manag wa arrest on a charg of batteri ; he retweet an unflatt pictur of hi main opponent wife , Heidi Cruz .And the poll show him trail by a wide margin in Wisconsin , which hold it primari on Tuesday . For some peopl , it a sign that Mr. Trump is final lose ground .But hi problem in Wisconsin is mainli about the state demograph , not self-inflict wound . Even a 10-percentage-point loss there wouldnt necessarili indic ani shift against him .The state ha alway look as if it would be one of Mr. Trump worst . Thi wa true even befor the primari began . Poll by Civi Analyt and Marquett Law both show Mr. Trump fare much wors there than nation , just as wa the case in neighbor Iowa , where he wound up lose to Ted Cruz .The result of other primari have consist point toward Mr. Trump weak in Wisconsin . Wev frequent publish articl use model to predict the result of contest base on demograph , and both model  one after the Super Tuesday primari and one after the March 15 primari  project Wisconsin to be one of Mr. Trump worst remain state .Our estim remain virtual unchang from what it wa after the Arizona and Utah contest March 22 : a five-point edg in Wisconsin for Mr. Cruz , almost exactli align with the poll . The model doe not account for the possibl redistribut of Marco Rubio former support .Whi is Wisconsin such a problemat state for Mr. Trump ? It not the worst possibl state for him ( Utah wa ) , but it doe forc him to confront some major weak .Lower educ attain among white adult is one of the strongest correl of Mr. Trump support . It true at everi level : He doe better in place where fewer white have high school diploma , colleg degre or postgradu degre . The lack of a high school educ is the biggest correl .Wisconsin is averag or abov averag in basic everi educ categori . It also unusu becaus mani of it most strongli Republican area are well-educ suburb , so more of the Republican vote will be cast in well-educ area than in , say , California .With the except of white Roman Cathol , Mr. Trump fare wors in area where larger share of the popul are report to be religi adher in the 2010 U. . Religion censu . ( He won a major of the Cathol vote in Massachusett , and it bode well for him in New York and New Jersey ) .You might not think of Wisconsin as an especi religi state . But it a bit abov averag for religi adher across all categori : the total religi rate , evangel and Cathol . The net effect is slightli neg for Mr. Trump .He fare worst in area with strong tradit famili , especi one with more children , more marri coupl and fewer singl mother . The state also ha an above-averag number of marri coupl  and most of the state most Republican district are in the top quartil for marriag rate .As with educ , Wisconsin isnt at the top of the list for these characterist . But there arent mani state that are consist averag to abov averag in educ , religion and marriag rate . Often , they cut in the opposit direct : The most religi state arent usual highli educ , and mani have lower marriag rate . Where these factor do converg , though , Mr. Trump struggl , as he did in Utah , Kansa and Iowa .Iowa , Utah , Kansa  and Wisconsin  have someth els in common : a larg popul who report their ancestri from predominantli Protest countri in Northern Europ .These voter repres the base of the Republican Parti for the centuri after the Civil War , whether it the old-stock Yankees who spread west from New England , or the German , Scandinavian and Dutch immigr who gener settl over the same stretch of the northern part of the Unit State later in the 19th centuri .These voter are probabl the biggest problem for Mr. Trump that you havent heard of : He would fare about 30 point wors in counti where all of the white resid report their ancestri from Protest countri in Northern Europ than he would in a place where none did , accord to our model . It the type of thing that help separ Northern Virginia  where Mr. Trump struggl greatli  from the Boston area , where he excel .Exactli whi thi is so import is a littl specul . Mani of these area , particularli in the Midwest , have a reput for niceness or manner ,  and may not like Mr. Trump in-your-fac New York style . Theyr the old Republicans  the former base of the parti . Perhap theyr likeli to be offend by Mr. Trump break with tradit Republican ideolog . Mr. Trump fare best among new Republican  includ white Southern and white Cathol  who might have less consist conserv view . Racism could play a role ( Mr. Trump ha made appeal to racial , ethnic and religi resent ) . Most measur of racism  like Googl search for racial charg term or score on the Implicit Associ Test  tend to show lower level of racism in the Upper Midwest , West and rural New England than in the South and industri North . It essenti the same region settl by peopl of Protest Northwest European ancestri .Now , that might just be a coincid  there arent veri mani minor in these same region , sinc the same econom forc that drew working-class Cathol to manufactur job in the industri North also drew African-American from the South . Or it might repres a deeper cultur tradit : It wa the old-stock Yanke who led the fight for abolit ; a centuri later it wa roughli the same area that swung against the fieri conserv Barri Goldwat when he fought and won the nomin against more moder and liber Republican .Theyr also the same area where Barack Obama defeat Hillari Clinton among white voter in the 2008 Democrat primari .All consid , the model-bas estim make Mr. Trump a five-point underdog , with a 40-35 edg for Mr. Cruz .Mr. Cruz could certainli outperform thi number becaus the model doesnt alloc ani of the vote for Mr. Rubio ( estim around 8 percent on March 15 ) , who ha suspend hi campaign . If the Rubio vote were split evenli between Mr. Cruz and John Kasich , which is about what happen in Utah , then Mr. Cruz might win , 44-35 , over Mr. Trump .To get a sens of whether Mr. Trump realli lost ground after hi controversi remark , the key number to watch is 35 percent : the expect share of the vote for Mr. Trump base on the result so far . If he fall short , he ha lost ground becaus of momentum , not demograph .', 'Carl ,  my friend told me , in a heat moment of financi debat , You need a new truck like you need a bullet in the head.I fire someth back about how off base she wa , how it would be a sound purchas , and who wa she to say anyway ?We went back and forth .

And it wasnt so much that I wa wrong . What we argu about boil down to a matter of person prefer .Truth is a pretti rare thing in person financ . More often than not , what we call truth is simpli a state of mind or an opinion . Even when the math point at what seem to obviou truth , feel can get in the way .For instanc , take the common advic from some invest profession to borrow as much as you can for your hous at the lowest possibl interest rate for the longest length of time .

In the end , isnt the point of money to make us feel more comfort , more secur , more at eas and happier ? If so , it may not make a lot of sens for us to tri to talk our friend ( or ourselv ) out of mathemat incorrect behavior .We tend to forget that money is about feel , and feel dont alway fit neatli into the truth. So the next time you find yourself in a heat debat about money , feel like a crusad for truth , put the sword down and remind yourself that what your debat is probabl not a matter of right or wrong , but one of person prefer .Take a step back , breath and tri again .

Unit State that crimin defend can spend their own money to hire the lawyer they want even when the govern want a chunk of it .Pay for a lawyer in a white-collar crime prosecut is almost alway an expens proposit , with legal expens quickli run into the hundr of thousand of dollar long befor a trial .If the case doe reach a courtroom , then those cost can grow into the million of dollar , as defend like Raj Rajaratnam and Rajat K. Gupta discov in fight insid trade charg .Even if you had the money , there wa a chanc the govern would tri to keep you from spend it . The feder forfeitur law give prosecutor a power  and oft-critic  tool to seek a court order freez a person asset until the crimin case is complet so that the money is avail to cover a fine or restitut to victim if there is a convict . That usual mean defend must reli on appoint counsel rather than the lawyer of their own choos and will have far fewer resourc to defend the case that can put them at a distinct disadvantag .The Suprem Court confront the issu of whether a court can freez innocent fund unconnect to ani violat befor there is a verdict in the prosecut of Sila Lui . She wa accus of a number of health care offens , which prosecutor claim result in close to $ 45 million be fraudul obtain , almost all of which she had spent .The govern file a civil asset forfeitur action to prevent Ms. Lui from spend $ 2 million she had avail that wa not connect to ani of the crime charg becaus those fund would be need to pay ani restitut or penalti after a convict . The order effect prevent her from hire a lawyer to defend the crimin case .Thi is not the first time the justic have confront the issu of whether an asset freez violat a defendant Sixth Amend right to counsel when a court keep a defend from use money in their possess to retain a lawyer .In 2014 , in Kaley v. Unit State , the court held that the defend , a wife and husband , could not challeng befor trial an indict accus them of theft of medic devic and money launder that prosecutor use as evid to secur an order freez a $ 500,000 certif of deposit they own . The court found that the money wa traceabl to the underli crime charg , so becaus a grand juri had determin there wa probabl caus the defend commit the offens , the freez order wa valid .The Suprem Court reach a differ conclus for Ms. Lui becaus her money wa not deriv from ani crimin violat , as the govern conced . In an opinion for four member of the Court , Justic Stephen G. Breyer wrote that a line must be drawn between a crimin defendant ( 1 ) taint fund and ( 2 ) innoc fund need to pay for counsel.The Sixth Amend includ the right to hire a lawyer of the defendant choos , at least as long as the person ha the money to pay for it . Justic Breyer state that thi interest outweigh the government need to preserv asset to pay a fine or restitut . To permit the govern to freez Luis untaint asset would unleash a principl of constitut law that would have no obviou stop place becaus the right to counsel of choic could be easili circumv through a court order .In an opinion concur with the result , Justic Clarenc Thoma state that the Sixth Amend right wa paramount to ani need to consid the government interest in seek an asset freez and therefor requir that the order be reject .The line between tainted and innocent asset may not alway be easi to discern . Justic Breyer assert that the constitut line we have drawn should prove workabl ,  but a dissent opinion by Justic Anthoni M. Kennedi complain that the true winner today are sophist crimin who know how to make crimin proce look untainted.It is the rare drug dealer who ha fund that can be shown to be the product of a legitim busi ventur untaint by illeg narcot trade , so the distinct will not be difficult for a court to appli in that kind of case .The greater impact of the Lui decis will be in white-collar crime case , especi those involv highli compens individu who are accus of misconduct in their busi or on behalf of a corpor employ . Figur out whether salari and benefit might be relat to potenti misconduct or were just ordinari compens may be difficult .The Suprem Court establish that innoc asset can be use to pay for a lawyer , but that doe not mean they can be use for ani other purpos .The recent arrest of Andrew Caspersen , who wa a partner at the Park Hill Group and is accus of steal at least $ 25 million from investor , illustr how difficult it could be to determin how far an asset freez might reach .Prosecutor and the Secur and Exchang Commiss say that Mr. Caspersen lost most of the money through aggress option trade . As describ in The New York Time , he had a privileg upbring and wa well-compens at hi Wall Street firm befor run afoul of the law .The Suprem Court decis in Lui will allow Mr. Caspersen to use money unrel to the fraud charg to pay for lawyer to defend himself . How much he can spend is unclear , howev , becaus at the end of hi opinion Justic Breyer wrote that a defend ha a right to use her own innocent properti to pay a reason fee for the assist of counsel. What constitut a reason fee wa not explain .Moreov , other use of the defendant money might not be permiss becaus they would not be a mean to assert the Sixth Amend right to counsel of choic .Prosecutor in a case like Mr. Caspersen could ask the court for a freez order restrict the use of asset for person reason while permit a certain amount to be avail for lawyer . That would present an interest issu about how close the legal fee would be monitor and whether the court want to overse a defendant account to make sure money is not be use for improp purpos .The Suprem Court ha describ the right to counsel as fundament to the legal system , especi when a defend ha the mean to retain a particular lawyer . How much the govern can interfer with that right now turn on where the money come from and what it would be use for , becaus a thief can not use stolen money to pay for a lawyer but can use what alreadi in hi bank account to do so .', 'American stock fell slightli in quiet trade on Monday as investor work through sever compani announc and prepar for the start of compani earn releas .Health care compani were solidli higher .

It stock ha fallen about 90 percent sinc August , as investor began to learn of account problem . The plung in the stock also mean Valeant can not easili acquir other drug maker  a main sourc of growth .There anoth reason : the compens of Valeant chief execut , J. Michael Pearson , and it senior execut , which most like play an import role in drive the company behavior . Through share and option acquir mostli from hi compens plan , Mr. Pearson own nearli 3 percent of Valeant , a stake that wa worth over $ 2.5 billion when the company stock wa trade at it high .The sheer size of Mr. Pearson hold give the impress that hi packag wa uniqu aggress . But in mani way it wasnt .Mr. Pearson compens had featur that resembl those of other chief execut . The way in which Mr. Pearson wa paid wa held up as an exampl of how to creat healthi incent . As a result , Valeant debacl is a remind of the subtl but harm effect that outsiz pay can have on other compani .As with ani other public compani , the detail of Mr. Pearson pay can be found in proxi statement issu each year , which lay out the intric method that compani board have devis for tie pay to perform .These statement show that Mr. Pearson earn the most in long-term award . The metric that determin these award wa someth call total sharehold return , basic the perform of a company stock price , with ani incom from dividend ad in .Pay a chief execut larg or sole on the basi of stock price perform might seem reckless . It would seem to creat incent for the execut to focu on action that get impress result for a year or two , rather than longer-term action that might yield higher and more sustain profit .But place a heavi emphasi on the share price is a surprisingli common practic  and is support by influenti group that advis sharehold on how to vote at annual meet .The Confer Board , a research group , found that , for 2014 , total sharehold return wa use in 54 percent of long-term pay award . And 31 percent had long-term plan that were determin wholli by the metric , though that percentag ha fallen in recent year .Mr. Pearson long-term plan also had a featur that gave him a lot more share as total sharehold return hit certain level . Hi 2011 compens agreement , provid a big payday for him , said that he would get zero performance share if Valeant stock price did not go up by at least 15 percent a year over the follow three year .Onc he hit that threshold , he would get 120,000 share . As the stock price hit other mark , he got more share . The award top out at a 60 percent-plu return , which would win him 480,000 share .Ratchet up pay like that is not uncommon . In 2014 , 54 percent of compani survey by the Confer Board had maximum payout that were 200 percent of the base award . Almost none exceed 250 percent , so Mr. Pearson 300 percent reward wa unusu .Mr. Pearson got someth els in the long-term plan set in 2011 that appear to have made it particularli bounti . The agreement includ an outright grant of 500,000 stock option . An analysi by Kevin J. Murphi , a financ and econom professor at the Univers of Southern California , found that , under a certain rang of stock price , the option grant wa significantli more gener than the perform share plan .The outright size of the option grant , and the price at which it start to pay off , is what made it more lucr than the stock award for the rang of stock price . ( The stock award becam more valuabl as the share price went up beyond thi rang , accord to the analysi . )Few compani are like Valeant , pursu the sort of growth-at-all-cost strategi that appear to fell the firm . Still , there are plenti of sign that the drive for higher execut compens propel a lot of the short-term think in American corpor . Compani that have rais mani billion of dollar in the junk bond market in recent year have spent startlingli littl of it on new plant and oper  thing that prime futur growth and provid more job . It went instead to pay back more expens debt , and to financ acquisit and privat equiti deal .Compani are current spend about $ 450 billion a year buy back share . Thi help chief execut increas the company earn per share , a measur of profit that sharehold focu on obsess . Conveni , it is often a measur use to help set execut pay .The impact of buyback on earn per share is not small ; Deutsch Bank calcul that in recent year about a quarter of per-shar earn growth ha come from use buyback to reduc the amount of share outstand .And privat compani , where execut pay is not tie to the perform of publicli trade share , invest more than their public peer , accord to some economist .But Valeant also rais the issu of skew incent and inequ . Mr. Pearson did put some of hi own money into Valeant , a requir that wa suppos to make him more account . But those sum were tini in comparison with what the compani paid him .And Mr. Pearson pay is a stark remind of how execut pay ha help widen wage differ . Analyst from the A.F.L.-C.I.O. , a feder of union , estim that chief execut pay wa 331 time as much as that of ordinari worker in 2013 , up from 46 time in the 1980 . In hi best-sel book on inequ , Capit in the Twenty-First Centuri ,  Thoma Piketti place much blame for rise incom differ on the lucr pay packag given to senior execut year after year .And there seem few way to stop the seemingli inexor rise of execut pay .Impos significantli higher tax on the highest earner is the other way to get at the problem , sinc compani might not pay as much if they knew that , say , 70 percent of the compens wa go to the govern .

The fleet of robot plane will initi cover more than half the tini African nation , creat a highli autom network to shuttl blood and pharmaceut to remot locat in hour rather than week or month .Rwanda , one of the world poorest nation , wa rank 170th by gross domest product in 2014 by the Intern Monetari Fund . And so it is strike that the countri will be the first , compani execut said , to establish a commerci drone deliveri network  put it ahead of place like the Unit State , where there have been heavili ballyhoo futurist drone deliveri system promis urban and suburban packag deliveri from tech giant such as Amazon and Googl .The concept of drone port is someth that a veri small decision-mak unit in the countri decid they were go to do ,  said Michael Fairbank , a member of the Rwandan presid Paul Kagame presidenti advisori council . It took a veri short time . It someth that America could learn from.That Rwanda is set to becom the first countri with a drone deliveri network illustr the often uneven natur of the adopt of new technolog . In the Unit State , drone have run into a wall of regul and conflict rule . But in Rwanda , the country master develop plan ha place a prioriti on the use of the machin , first for medicin and then more broadli for econom develop .Rwanda ha a vision to becom a technolog hub for East Africa and ultim the whole contin of Africa ,  said William Hetzler , a founder of Ziplin , which is base in thi seasid town . Project like our fit veri well with that strategy.The new drone system will initi be capabl of make 50 to 150 daili deliveri of blood and emerg medicin to Rwanda 21 transfus facil , mostli in hospit and clinic in the western half of the nation .The drone system is base on a fleet of 15 small aircraft , each with twin electr motor , a 3.5-pound payload and an almost eight-foot wingspan . The system speed make it possibl to maintain a cold chain  essenti a temperature-control suppli chain need to provid blood and vaccin  which is often not practic to establish in develop countri .The Ziplin drone will use GP receiv to navig and commun via the Rwandan cellular network . They will be abl to fli in rough weather condit , endur wind up to 30 mile per hour .When they reach the hospit , they will not land but will drop small packag from veri low altitud .

The deal , announc on Monday , would also prove especi help in give the older airlin valuabl space at major California airport and lucr transcontinent rout .At the same time , Alaska Air must now be care in how it integr a brand belov by it cadr of custom who ador it cheeki imag , onboard Wi-Fi and sooth onboard purpl light .For Alaska Air , buy Virgin America wa in some way a natur consequ of the success merger that have alreadi concentr domest air travel in four primari airlin : American , Delta , Unit and Southwest . Togeth , they control roughli 85 percent of the country airlin capac .Put togeth Alaska and Virgin America will not creat a new airlin that can stand toe-to-to with those bigger compani . But it will creat a tougher competitor for JetBlu , with which Alaska compet fierc to win over the smaller airlin , and which it will displac as the country fifth-biggest airlin .The goal is to be the premier airlin on the West Coast ,  Brad Tilden , Alaska Air chief execut , said in a telephon interview on Monday .The move wa an ambiti one by Mr. Tilden , an Alaska veteran who becam chief execut less than three year ago . Befor Monday , the onli major acquisit Alaska had made wa buy the region carrier Horizon Air 20 year ago .But to Mr. Tilden and hi team , gain addit scale wa imper . While Alaska ha been laud for it organ growth effort , acquir slot at desir airport  particularli high-traff one like San Francisco Intern and Lo Angel Intern  ha been challeng .At the same time , Alaska tradit hub of Seattle-Tacoma Intern Airport ha been challeng in recent year by Delta . The bigger airlin ha sought to make Seattle airport , known as SeaTac , it own hub for Western flight .Alaska , meanwhil , ha clean up it financi health . The compani ha an investment-grad credit rate  rare for an airlin  and ha more than $ 1.3 billion in cash on it balanc sheet . So it wa time to begin hunt .We feel like wev done realli well with the real estat wev had ,  Mr. Tilden said . What can we do to get bigger ? The search for an acquisit target began about 18 month ago , Mr. Tilden said . By last fall , Alaska contact Virgin America about a potenti combin , begin an auction process for the smaller airlin .Virgin America wa an ideal takeov target . The compani open for busi in 2007 as an addit lower-cost carrier with a higher level of servic than that provid by the tradit airlin . It wa the brainchild of Richard Branson , the British mogul behind the empir of brand that share the Virgin name .Sinc go public in late 2014 , Virgin America ha larg struggl , with it stock price essenti flat . Analyst have said that the compani face high cost and the pressur of be a low-cost airlin whose servic ran closer to premium level . It recent turn to profit wa help by the tumbl in oil price that also aid it competitor .Though JetBlu also compet fierc , Alaska simpli had more financi firepow . In the end , Alaska offer $ 57 a share  a knockout price , over 80 percent higher than where Virgin America stock had been trade befor the news of it sale process emerg . Alaska insist on sign the deal on Friday night to swiftli cut off the bid contest .Includ debt and aircraft oper leas , the Virgin America deal is valu at about $ 4 billion .The compani said they expect to achiev $ 225 million in annual cost save follow the merger , after incur one-tim integr cost of $ 300 million to $ 350 million . The combin airlin would have annual revenu of more than $ 7 billion , the compani said .One potenti challeng for Alaska and Virgin America is persuad govern regul to approv the deal .The Justic Depart ha begun to take a tougher approach toward airlin merger in recent year , includ briefli su to block the union of American and US Airway .But Mr. Tilden said that combin Alaska and Virgin would yield a stronger airlin that could better compet against bigger rival . And put the two airlin togeth is meant to expand hi company network  the two share littl overlap in their rout  and not lead to higher price .What I will say is that thi is a pro-consum transact ,  he said . Alaska and Virgin will be stronger togeth than on their own.Investor in Virgin America appear thrill by news of the sale , push the company stock up nearli 42 percent to $ 55.11 . Sharehold in Alaska , by contrast , were less enthusiast , as that company stock fell 3.8 percent , to $ 78.93 .But analyst appear to believ in Mr. Tilden long-term plan .ALK is pay a steep price for these asset , but we think it is worth the price ,  Jim Corridor , an analyst with Standard & Poor Capit IQ , wrote in a research note on Monday , refer to Alaska ticker symbol .He ad , We think VA wa a price disruptor in the industri , so we think we will see less discount on those rout ,  refer to Virgin America symbol .One promin investor publicli profess some disappoint in Monday announc : Mr. Branson himself .

They are angri becaus the rich are get richer , the averag guy is struggl and the govern in Washington hasnt done anyth to stop the trend .But it may not be that simpl .Data on the nation econom recoveri , people reaction to current econom condit and their overal sens of satisfact with life do not suggest American are angri . In fact , histor measur indic peopl are about as happi and satisfi with the economi and with their live as they were in 1983 , when Ronald Reagan told us it wa morn again in America.So whi doe it feel more like a 1 a.m. bar brawl ?The answer may have more to do with polit parti than econom , or at least with the interact of the two . Today voter have sort themselv and polar into partisan group that look veri differ than they did in the late 1980 . And member of each side like the other side less than befor . American arent annoy onli by the economi ; theyr annoy with one anoth .Object econom condit measur by the Feder Reserv suggest that the nation recoveri began in 2010 , when gross domest product start to expand , unemploy start to fall and real dispos incom began to increas . By 2015 , the miseri index  a combin measur of unemploy and inflat  wa about as low as it had been sinc the 1950 , mean an activ demand for good and servic along with low unemploy and inflat .Most American seem to appreci thi growth . Data on the Index of Consum Sentiment , one of the longest-run measur of Americans view of the economi , show that by the end of 2015 , consum sentiment wa as posit as it had been in the mid-2000 and mid-1980 . It wa nearli ident to where it wa at the end of 1983 , when Mr. Reagan re-elect romp began to take shape .Even break the consum sentiment data down by incom level doe littl to buoy the argument that American were pessimist . From 2009-2015 , the averag gap in econom satisfact between the upper and lower third of the incom distribut wa 13.7 point , much lower than it wa dure the Reagan year ( 21.3 ) and lower than the gap dure the administr of the elder Georg Bush ( 14.7 ) , Bill Clinton ( 16.7 ) and Georg W. Bush ( 18.4 ) .As we enter 2016 , American of all incom level felt posit about the economi , though by some indic mani peopl had not recov . The employment-popul ratio and median household incom , for exampl , began to recov onli in 2015 .To get a sens of whether these econom factor were affect the gener mood of the nation in a way not captur by consum sentiment , I examin one of the longest-stand measur of gener happi . Sinc 1972 , the Gener Social Survey ha ask peopl to take thing all together and rate their level of happi . The 40-year trend show onli modest chang  and may actual suggest a small increas in happi in recent year .Describ Americans mood as distinct angri in 2015 elid thi evid . American were optimist about the nation economi and gener happi  in fact , no less optimist or happi than they had been histor .But there wa a sens in the fall and winter of 2015 of one chang . Use analyt tool provid by Crimson Hexagon , I calcul the averag monthli increas in the share of news articl about the 2016 elect with the word angry. Between Novemb 2015 and March 2016 , the share of stori about angri voter increas by 200 percent .Some evid suggest that the ire came from polit . When ask by pollster about trust the govern , the direct of the countri , American progress or the presid , American were gloomier than their econom assess might have predict . Broken out by parti , these pessimist view reveal a grow partisan divid , one that been distil around racial attitud for nearli two decad .The increas align between parti and racial attitud goe back to the earli 1990 . The Pew Valu Survey ask peopl whether they agre that we should make everi effort to improv the posit of minor , even if it mean give them preferenti treatment.Over time , Americans parti identif ha becom more close align with answer to thi question and other like it . Pew report that , sinc 1987 , the gap on thi question between the two parti ha doubl  from 18 point to 40 points. Democrat are now much more support ( 52 percent ) of effort to improv racial equal than they were a few decad ago , while the view of Republican have been larg unchang ( 12 percent agre ) .That Democrat and Republican have differ view on issu is not surpris . But recent work by Stanford University Shanto Iyengar and hi co-author show someth els ha been brew in the elector : a grow hostil toward member of the opposit parti . Thi enmiti , they argu , percol into opinion about everyday life .Partisan , for exampl , are more concern that their children might marri someon of the opposit parti ( vs. peopl in Britain today and the Unit State in 1960 ) . They found partisan surprisingli will to discrimin against peopl who are not member of their polit parti . Wev enter an age of party- .Write in The Washington Post , Michael Tesler , a Univers of California , Irvin , polit scientist , explain that becaus the grow partisan divid is partli fuel by racial attitud , partisan ( in Washington and in the elector ) also take increasingli opposit posit on mani racial inflect controversi .Some are polit , like polic misconduct . Other spill into area we think of as more social than polit , like sport , music and movi : about Academi Award nomin , for exampl .Democrat and Republican like each other a lot less now than they did 60 year ago , in part becaus they have sort into parti base on attitud on race , religion and ethnic . These attitud and emot have been activ in the lead-up to the 2016 elect .

G.M . and Fiat Chrysler each recent report strong earn increas for the first quarter .But not all automak are benefit as much . Luxuri carmak like BMW and Mercedes-Benz typic sell more car than S.U.V. , so the shift away from car is not help them . In the Unit State , they have maintain sale but have had to offer more incent .Truck are not the onli bright spot for Ford .

They were paid for in secret , expos with a joy feroc that enrich Gawker founder and help redefin how far our reality-TV cultur could go to satisfi it appetit for gossip and news about the famou , the power and , increasingli , just the mildli interest .I visit those offic last week in part to find out whether the $ 140 million in civil award against Gawker , for show a privat sex tape star the retir wrestler Hulk Hogan , would be it undo . But I wa after a bigger question : Have we final found the bottom , or more gener , the limit ? After decad of journalist scandal-mong , each more intrus than the last  and then juic by the Internet  wa the juri in Florida that rule so decis against Gawker speak for the entir cultur in say , Enough ?I do not come at the question from the monasteri .

I show up at the hous on the day of hi daughter bat mitzvah . ( Sorri , Dr . Crane ! ) John F.

Give her a break , he plead , she wa new to all thi . ( We call our editor from a pay phone , certain they would allow us to heed the request . Get back out there ,  came the repli . )That wa all befor technolog made it easi for a guy name Bubba the Love Spong to invit hi friend Hulk Hogan ( real name , Terri Bollea ) to have sex with the woman who wa then hi wife , and to record it so that it find it way to a popular websit , where it could be view by million of visitor and instantli share with million more . The juror believ Mr. Bollea testimoni that he did not know he wa be record , and that Gawker violat hi privaci right .They also found it infuri . The $ 115 million in compensatori damag wa $ 15 million more than Mr. Bollea had ask for .As one juror said on Good Morn America : We drew a line.For Gawker , whose parent compani ha a net worth of roughli $ 250 million , it wa less a line than a hangman noos . Still , the mood at the offic last week seem unbow .Gawker wa prepar to file paper on Monday seek to have the jury verdict thrown out or the award reduc . It will argu that Mr. Bollea did not prove hi right to privaci trump Gawker right to cover him aggress as a world-fam former wrestler who ha spoken freeli about hi sexual adventur .The public figur cant just say , I control thi convers ,  Heather Dietrick , Gawker presid and gener counsel , told me . He out there talk about detail of hi sex life ,  she said , continu to give veri specif detail  anatom and otherwis  about what she had in mind .Not necessarili the stuff to inspir futur applic to the Columbia School of Journal . And Ms. Dietrick acknowledg the stori is not the Pentagon Papers. But it comport with Gawker longtim drive to be , as it founder , Nick Denton , say , Uncompromis and uncompromising in unearth whatev might drive reader interest , intrigu , truth and web traffic .Interestingli , one of Gawker Media first big hit wa a Pari Hilton sex video , which ran on it Fleshbot site in 2003 . ( Mr. Denton sold Fleshbot in 2012 . ) Far from threaten to bring the hous down , it help solidifi Mr. Denton compani as a real web player . The tape fit with Gawker sensibl  punch up at the arrog of wealth and celebr ( in thi case an heiress who wa famous famou for be famou ) in the media pirate tradit of it forebear at Spi magazin .But Spi , as it co-found Kurt Andersen point out to me , wa not in the constant-search-for-click busi . And as Gawker web traffic grew , it got into troubl when it seem to be meanli punch down , expos secret about peopl who were not so obvious newsworthi . There wa the post last summer , for instanc , about a rel unknown marri male media execut and hi alleg attempt to pay for sex with a male escort . It drew indign howl , and Gawker retract the piec .Then there wa the decis by Deadspin , a Gawker-own site , to show a random video in 2010 of an inebri femal colleg student have sex in a bathroom stall . At trial , Hulk Hogan lawyer present email of the woman desper entreati to take it down and Deadspin lightheart refus . These thing do pass ,  the former Deadspin and Gawker editor , A. J. Daulerio , told her . Keep your head up. It did not play well with the juri , nor did hi reason for later chang hi mind : It wa possibl rape.Suddenli , it wa not just the fabul famou  Michael Jackson and John F. Kennedi Jr.  whose live we were be invit to peer into ; it wa peopl just like us . At the same time , as social media made us star of our own movi , peopl like us could increasingli relat to the peril of public exposur onc known onli by the famou .Mr. Denton told me that thi phenomenon play a part in the outcom of the trial . He point to a moment when a potenti juror describ be move to ask a friend to remov an unflatt photo of her from a Facebook post . Social media , he said , made the juri pool more sympathet to the celebr public machin ,  which make similar request .Thi is all part of the Internet self-correct that my colleagu John Herrman wrote about a coupl of week ago , how the public is recoil from the web raunchiest offer . Mr. Denton more or less subscrib to that theori , which is whi he recent vow to make hi site 10 to 15 percent nicer.But it onli goe so far . Two of hi staff member , Tom Scocca , execut featur editor of Gawker , and Emma Carmichael , editor in chief of Jezebel , told me sometim truth and justic lie in the muck . An item about old accus of sexual misconduct against Bill Cosbi , for instanc , help start the re-examin of hi treatment of women that led to crimin charg . Deadspin use of a photo purport to be a sext shot of Brett Favre peni broke open broader sexual harass alleg against him and hi team .Such high-mind argument can be a thin veil when attach to the journal of expos genitalia . As Mr. Bollea lawyer , Charl Harder , argu to me in an interview last week , if there wa one thing the founder didnt have in mind when they wrote the First Amend , it wa uncensor sex tape and secretli film privat convers in a bedroom.Mr . Harder is use Gawker own mantra about transpar against it  say he will collect hi client due by unmask a shroud of secrecy around Gawker financi structur . That structur , he say , allow Gawker to divert million in profit to Kinja , it sister compani in Hungari , which run Gawker technolog platform .Ms. Dietrick of Gawker counter by say that there wa noth unusu about Gawker corpor setup and that the company appeal would preclud ani payment relat to Mr. Bollea juri award . Gawker abil to surviv intact depend on whether she is right .Now , the bigger question : Ha our cultur reach it limit with the invas and the tawdri ?Mayb .

The trainer told them that to be a leader is to design a futur that is unpredict and which nobodi bet on.He couldnt sleep at night , think about hi well-ord , 16-year career at Intel . So he decid to take a risk . With four colleagu , he made the decis to take the uncertain path , which today is becom more common in China than even in Silicon Valley : He quit hi job to begin a start-up that special in autonom , or self-driv , car .In the process , Mr. Wu hit upon a rare moment when a tech sector in China is develop in lock step with a similar but separ market in the Unit State .In fact , some argu that condit in China are actual more favor for quick adopt of driverless car , in part becaus of more aggress support from the nation and local govern . And , unlik in the Unit State , China never fulli develop a romanc with the open road and car ownership .Car ownership ha spike in China , of cours . And in recent year , it ha becom a middle-class statu symbol to own a car . For the ultrawealthi , there are club dedic to Ferrari and Maserati .But enorm traffic jam in China largest citi can make drive a less-than-romant experi . Whi not let a machin built with artifici intellig insid do the work for you ?Research done by the Boston Consult Group suggest that within 15 year China will be the largest market for autonom vehicl , said Xavier Mosquet , a manag director at the firm . Autom taxi will most like lead the trend .It not that peopl are more will to use the car in Beij or Shanghai , it that the econom valu is much higher in China than in the U.S. ,  Mr. Mosquet said , ad that air pollut could be as much a catalyst as bad traffic .Even as American compani like Googl and Tesla work on autonom vehicl , a number of Chines compani are work on driverless car technolog . The Internet compani Leshi Internet Inform & Technolog ( better known as Letv ) ha a driverless car tech unit , and the Chines carmak Great Wall Motor ha open a research center in Silicon Valley .

Chri Urmson , the director of Google self-driving-car program , ha said hi goal is to bring a self-driv car to market by 2019 .Other are more cautiou , and say they believ it may take a decad or longer for self-driv car to hit the market . And among the biggest automak like Toyota , the interest is less in car that drive themselv than in car that have artifici intellig capabl to assist driver , like emerg brake .We see a few stage toward fulli autonom drive ,  said Mr. Wu , ad that safeti technolog are come quickli . He said driver assist system will be follow by complet driverless car in restrict circumst , such as on privat road , fix rout at low speed and in control environ . Uise will begin by develop technolog that assist rather than replac driver .Baidu ha team up with BMW and recent said it wa test it technolog in the Unit State . Baidu ha said it is prepar to introduc autom public transport servic in China within the next two year .Unlik Googl , which ha had difficulti convinc regul in it home state , California , that self-driv car are readi for the road , Baidu alreadi ha the regulatori and infrastructur support of a number of local Chines govern , which it will use to introduc small autonom buse that will run set rout .The Chines govern is play a major role in the overal driverless market . Along with empow Baidu to run public transport , in other case central and local govern have been invest in research and develop for driverless car project .Mr. Wu also embodi a grow entrepreneuri movement in China . The Chines govern report that 4.8 million new compani were regist from March 2014 to May 2015 , a rate of 10,600 new busi per day , or seven everi minut . Even though ventur invest ha begun to dri up in China recent , the nation ha clearli been infect with a Silicon Valley attitud .Although in some quarter it is still known as the land of copycat technolog , China ha long sinc move on to copi the start-up etho of the Valley , with more and more entrepreneur creat their own compani .The Chines govern is encourag the boom as a way to solv a number of econom problem , includ unemploy and the transit of the economi from one center on manufactur to one base on servic .Thi year more than seven million peopl are enter the job market in China ,  said Haiyang Li , a professor at the Jess H.

In an endors letter to the court , Ms. Wood disclos that she had famili member who have had in the past contact with Andrew Caspersen.', 'PALO ALTO , Calif.  Dion Weisler , the chief execut of HP Inc. , recent held out a bulki laptop that wa the pride of 2012 . Thi is the laptop we had when I came here ,  he said .He open it to reveal anoth HP laptop within it hollowed-out insid . Then he open that machin to produc anoth smaller and lighter laptop . Like the last in a set of nest Russian doll , a final and even more slender laptop emerg from insid the third machin .Pretti spectacular , right ?  said Mr. Weisler , a toothi and optimist Australian .It wa an impress visual trick  and one with a point . On Tuesday , Mr. Weisler will publicli introduc a person comput similar to the slimmest one he brought out of the nest machin , with a 13.3-inch screen but even thinner . At less than 11 millimet thick ( less than half an inch ) , he said , it beat the best effort by Appl and show that HP PC are still hip and innov . In fact , HP ha made a small number of the new slim laptop in gold and diamond , to be sold for $ 25,000 each for chariti , with the unveil plan for a New York Time Luxuri Confer in Pari .HP new laptop , call Spectr , underlin the length to which PC maker must now go to attract custom attent . Apart from HP , PC maker like Dell and Lenovo are also pump money into the design of desktop and laptop comput , come up with increasingli sleek machin , as well as two in one ,  whose screen detach to becom tablet . There are PC that fit in a pocket , understand voic and gestur , or sens when they need repair and call on their own for a remot tuneup .Yet as peopl increasingli gravit to smartphon and tablet for their comput need , shift into what ha been call the post-PC era ,  the invest into design and new innov by PC maker may come to naught . Last year , 289 million PC were sold worldwid , an 8 percent drop from 2014 , accord to Gartner , a research firm .The sale declin wa just the latest in sever year when the PC market face an onslaught of smartphon and tablet as cooler altern . The falloff is expect to level off thi year , with PC sale even expect to begin grow slowli in 2017 . But that still leav the question of whether PC can seem cool again .Even peopl who depend on the PC industri now lack passion for these onetim miracl product . It one of mani way onto the Internet now ,  Mikako Kitagawa , an analyst at Gartner , said of the PC . The big compani are pretti much make similar devices.That clearli stick in the PC industry collect craw .I hear post-PC era and think it rubbish ,  said Jeff Clark , presid for client solut at Dell . We sell a quarter-billion devic . The instal base is 1.9 billion devic . Mayb it taken for grant , but the innov is second to none.Mr. Weisler , who becam chief execut of HP Inc. in Novemb , when the origin Hewlett-Packard wa split into two entiti  one a PC and print busi , the other an enterpris technolog compani  also say he doesnt agre that PC are dull . The product can still be fetish object , he said .In aggreg , devic like PC , tablet and smartphon are still grow , but they are also shift ,  said Mr. Weisler , 48 , who ha spent hi career in PC , work at Acer and Lenovo befor join HP . You can creat new categories.To do that , Mr. Weisler ha modestli increas research and develop spend and plan to rais that amount . Under Hewlett-Packard previou chief execut , Meg Whitman , print and PC didnt get invest dollar ,  Mr. Weisler said . He also plan to merg HP consum and commerci PC busi , hope to bolster the cachet of PC both at home and at the offic .Obstacl remain in the way of Mr. Weisler vision . When Hewlett-Packard wa one giant compani , it wa valu at $ 60 billion . Now HP Inc. and the separ enterpris compani , call Hewlett Packard Enterpris , are worth about $ 53 billion .A lot of the woe ha been in the PC busi . Not onli did HP Inc. revenu in it fiscal first quarter drop 12 percent from last year , to $ 12.2 billion , but oper margin fell half a percentag point to 7.6 percent , compar with the nation averag oper margin of 10.7 percent . In respons , Mr. Weisler ha acceler a plan to lay off 3,000 of HP Inc. 50,000 employe .Even so , he insist on a bright futur . On a recent day , he show off the earli result of hi push at the company Silicon Valley headquart . One devic that look like a small tablet or a larg smartphon could , in fact , be either of those  or a PC , or a laptop . It work on it own , or it could fit into a dock attach to a keyboard and a big screen , function like a PC . It could also connect wirelessli with a keyboard and fold screen , make it a laptop .Anoth machin in the room wa simpli a laptop , but the edg hid a seri of qualiti microphon . It had Internet phone control built in , and it wa design to open up until it wa complet flat . That way it could be use for confer call , catch voic all around the tabl .Nearbi , HP latest printer had lost their move nozzl in favor of an 8.5-inch bar that spit about a billion dot a second . The compani said it could now do laser-qu print twice as fast and for half the cost , set it up for the day when 3-D print becom commonplac .Elsewher in the PC industri , Dell recent releas a PC that work with Oculu , the virtual realiti goggl from Facebook . Lenovo ha been make more kind of two in one comput . Microsoft , which make the Window oper system that underli most PC , ha also gotten into the PC hardwar game and recent unveil it own comput that recogn handwrit and speech .Wer bring an eleg of design ,  Mr. Clark said , ad that Dell plan to increas spend on research and develop .And for all the challeng , Mr. Weisler think HP can thrive when PC demand pick up , and it might even get itself some of the shine that surround Appl  which ha soar in valu on the back of the iPhon  after the last diamond-encrust PC leav hi desk .There is valu in build thing that are close to peopl and understand thing like facial express ,  he said . If you focu on build for the high end , your other devic get better , too.', 'The Powerpuff Girl have battl a rogue galleri of evil lab monkey , hillbilli monster and androgyn devil .

Or an app . Or realli much of a digit presenc at all .At a time when most of the world publish have accept as gospel that the futur is digit , such a bet on dead tree ha more than a few industri analyst scratch their head . The move come as news outlet like The Huffington Post , Politico and Busi Insid make stronger digit push into European market and just as some of the region establish titl are scale back or end print product altogeth . The Independ , one of Britain most respect newspap , went digital-onli on March 26 , and El Pa , Spain largest daili , warn it staff last month that it wa consid a similar move .But with a goal of attract as mani as one million pay reader a week , The New Day publish , Triniti Mirror , one of Britain largest media compani , is convinc that it print-onli daili can find an audienc in Britain famous crowd newspap market .There is a bold to that decis ,  said Dougla McCabe of Ender Analysi , a media research group in London . At a time when print circul are fall at high percentag rate year in and year out , to launch a print-onli product is realli brave . You have to feel pretti confid that you are fill a genuin materi market gap.Start just over a month ago , the 40-page New Day print five day a week and is avail at 40,000 newsstand across Britain , where it sell for 50 penc , or about 70 cent , a copi . Home subscript are not an option and , asid from an initi two-week promot in earli March , the newspap doe not plan to give away ani of it content .You dont want to go down that avenu ,  said The New Day editor , Alison Phillip . There is still a signific number of peopl who have the habit in their blood of pay for content and who prefer the experi of read off-lin , she said .Ms. Phillip acknowledg that the sheer volum of free content onlin , as well as the conveni of be abl to read it on mobil phone and other devic , ha help drive reader away from print . But with The New Day , Triniti Mirror is also gambl that print readership is declin for anoth simpl reason : Mani British reader simpli do not like the other print choic avail .So-cal qualiti daili like The Guardian , The Time and The Telegraph are too dens and ponder for some , Ms. Phillip said , while other reader are put off by the brash tone and overt partisanship of mass-market tabloid like The Sun , which is own by Rupert Murdoch , or The Daili Mirror , which is also own by Triniti Mirror .Our reader are time poor ,  Ms. Phillip said of The New Day target audienc , and they dont like be told what to think.Still , analyst said , persuad consum to switch back to buy print media from a newsstand is no small challeng .Bi definit , these are laps newspap reader ,  said Mr. McCabe of Ender Analysi . Even if their hypothesi is correct , the realiti is most peopl are consum news on mobil devic . That requir a big chang in habits.If The New Day initi sale figur are anyth to go by , those digit habit die hard .Although The New Day sold as mani as 150,000 daili copi at a discount price of 25 penc in earli March , it sale have sinc fallen precipit , accord to British media report , to fewer than 90,000 copi . Triniti Mirror declin to confirm those earli figur , cite plan to publish audit sale figur later in the spring . The compani ha said it expect to turn a profit by the end of the year . And while it doe have some advertis , it busi model is circul driven .Ms. Phillip said she wa awar that sale had fallen off sinc the newspaper initi market push , but she ad that thi wa unsurpris . It wa never go to be easi to launch a new print product ,  she said .Jane Singer , a journal professor at Citi Univers London , said the decis to stay off digit platform had onli made the task of promot The New Day that much harder .If your tri to launch a new print product today , then it crucial that it becom someth peopl are talk about ,  she said . The realiti is that , for most peopl , those kind of convers are happen online.The New Day ha turn to social media as a promot tool , broadcast screen shot of it front page and teaser about specif articl . But so far , it social audienc  47,000 on Facebook , 12,000 on Twitter  remain a fraction of what most newspap with shareabl digit content are abl to attract .Still , not all analyst are readi to dismiss The New Day as a doom experi .By forgo digit , Mr. McCabe said , The New Day avoid the problem of have to stretch scarc newsroom resourc across multipl platform .Publish today are alway tri to balanc a print and an onlin strategi as if somehow it is all go to be the same thing ,  Mr. McCabe said . Everyon feel like they are compromising.That balanc act is prove increasingli tricki for mani British newspap .Face with a 25 percent drop in print revenu last year , the Guardian Media Group , which ha invest heavili in a digit and oversea expans of it flagship newspap , The Guardian , last month confirm plan to cut 250 job , about 13 percent of it work forc .In the meantim , The Time of London , anoth Murdoch paper , said last week that it wa abandon coverag of break news and focus it resourc on produc commentari and analysi . Updat to the newspaper websit , which is be merg with that of it sister paper , The Sunday Time , will be reduc to three time a day .Triniti Mirror ha gone out of it way to stress the import of keep overhead cost low at The New Day . The newspap ha about 25 staff member , mani of whom have been draft from other public in the group . ( Ms. Phillip , 45 , is a former editor of two Triniti Mirror weekli , The Sunday Mirror and The Sunday Peopl . ) Triniti Mirror is also abl to print and distribut The New Day use it exist press and vast nation distribut network , which limit cost .But even a low-cost newspap need a loyal readership to surviv , and analyst said The New Day decis to target a broad , general-interest audienc , while perhap appeal to mani advertis , meant that it would struggl to differenti itself from titl  includ free one like Metro and The Even Standard  aim at a similar readership .The challeng is to be better than what alreadi out there ,  Ms. Singer said . Whatev your platform strategi is , you still have to have the goods.With a photo-driven design and color typographi , The New Day strike a punchi , convers tone . Articl and column are brief and frequent pair with vivid chart or graphic . Ms. Phillip ad that editor usual strove for a positive stori mix  even on day when the top news wa decidedli somber , like the recent terrorist attack in Brussel .Ms. Phillip said she remain encourag by posit comment the paper wa get from reader so far  but she acknowledg that the feedback wa come primarili onlin .That kind of postdigital reader engag , she said , suggest that there is still room for success experiment in print publish .It not just about the news . It is about the experi ,  Ms. Phillip said . For mani peopl , go to a Facebook page for the news is pretti unfulfilling.', 'Facebook say it think live video is a big deal .

That wa it . Veri sad.', 'DETROIT  Despit a steadi stream of new model from a number of automak , sale thi year of electr and hybrid vehicl have fail to keep pace with the growth in the overal American market .But if the market for electrifi car wa slumber , Tesla Motor woke it up with a jolt Thursday with the unveil of it come Model 3 lineup of afford , zero-emiss vehicl .Given that electr and hybrid vehicl account for onli about 2 percent of last year record-set sale in the Unit State , the extraordinari reaction to Tesla first mass-market model wa a vivid demonstr of the potenti demand in the segment .It show that the futur of electr vehicl is not necessarili bleak ,  said Alec Gutierrez , an analyst with the research firm Kelley Blue Book . Mayb wev been wait for the right product that reson with consumers.Tesla said on Friday that it had book reserv  at $ 1,000 each  from nearli 200,000 peopl for the first Model 3 sedan , which will not be avail until next year .With a start price of $ 35,000 and a batteri rang of 215 mile , the new Tesla is a big leap in the company expans beyond expens luxuri model .The final step in the master plan is a mass-market , afford car ,  Elon Musk , Tesla chief execut , said at the lavish introduct of the Model 3 held at the company design studio in Hawthorn , Calif .Other automak are also press ahead with import new electr model , includ the Chevrolet Bolt from Gener Motor , a revamp version of the Nissan Leaf , and new entri from Ford Motor and Hyundai .With those and other electrifi vehicl come in the next coupl of year , the segment could final begin to grow beyond the fring of the market .Last year , automak sold fewer than 400,000 electr and hybrid vehicl in the Unit State , even as the overal market soar to record sale of 17.5 million , analyst said .On Friday , automak said the torrid pace of sale cool some in March , when overal sale increas about 3 percent , to about 1.6 million vehicl sold . That wa lower than Wall Street estim , and the close watch season adjust annual sale rate drop below 17 million for the first time thi year .Sale of truck and sport util vehicl continu to account for most of the gain , while passeng car lag behind . And despit the introduct of a new Priu hybrid from Toyota , there wa littl improv in overal sale of electrifi model .The segment ha been pretti soft over all , and we expect to see that continu thi year ,  Mr. Gutierrez said .Electr car and hybrid model , which are power by both a gasolin engin and a batteri , are critic to nearli everi automaker effort to improv their overal fleetwid fuel economi to meet a new feder standard of 54.5 mile per gallon by 2025 . And meet the goal ha becom even more import in the wake of the Pari climat accord last year , which mandat signific reduct in carbon emiss .Despit the lukewarm accept of electrifi vehicl so far by consum , environment group are prais the impact that the rel small sale have had alreadi .A report releas thi week by the Union of Concern Scientist show , for exampl , that about 200,000 electr car have been sold in California to date , which ha reduc annual gasolin consumpt in the state by 56 million gallon .New model like G.M. Bolt , Tesla Model 3 and the new plug-in Priu Prime should keep the number of electr vehicl grow ,  said David Reichmuth , a senior engin with the scientist group .Trend in the marketplac , howev , are work against electrifi model . With fuel price still hover at about $ 2 a gallon , mani consum are choos larger vehicl that are more afford to own when ga is cheap .And with automak also improv the mileag of their exist compact car and small sport util vehicl , mani buyer are meet their fuel-economi need with convent , gas-pow model instead of electrifi one .Still , the Tesla introduct is a sign that latent demand for electr car could translat into big sale in the showroom down the road .Mr. Musk said Tesla wa prepar for a surg in demand by ad dealership , prep it California assembl plant to build as mani as 500,000 electr car a year , and build a new factori in Nevada to produc batteri .As far as the Model 3 is concern , Mr. Musk wa characterist confid of it abil to compet with ani car  electr or not  on the market . You will not be abl to buy a better car for $ 35,000 ,  he said .For the most part , industri execut say that lower price and greater drive rang are the key factor in jump-start the electr market .Carlo Ghosn , the chief execut of the Japanes automak Nissan and the French carmak Renault , said recent that the electr segment need a wider and more divers array of model to interest a larger audienc of potenti buyer .Nissan ha had limit success with the all-electr Leaf , but growth is a step by step process , Mr. Ghosn said last month at the New York Intern Auto Show .Wer not in it so much to showcas technolog ,  he said . Our main driver is go to be the mass market for electr cars.', 'Rob Austin and hi wife , Natalia , have a 10-month-old son , healthi incom and plenti of cash in the bank for a down payment on a hous . But they are happili rent a townhous in Pasadena , Calif. , with no plan to buy for now , given the frothi price in their area .A long as there is such a disconnect , where a coupl like my wife and me have to put down a gargantuan down payment and still have a larg monthli payment to get into a decent , and not necessarili nice , hous , that is a game we dont wish to play ,  said Mr. Austin , a 39-year-old busi manag at a biotechnolog compani . When home price-to-incom level come back to a more normal level , when that happen , then we will be the first to jump in . If that never happen , that is O.K.More American household are rent , across all incom level and gener , for differ reason . But when homeownership is the centerpiec of the American dream , most of us have intern certain ideal : Buy a home build equiti , put you on the fast track to build wealth . Rent , by contrast , is essenti throw money to the wind .But with renter now account for 37 percent of all household , the highest level sinc the mid-1960 , accord to the Joint Center for Hous Studi of Harvard Univers , more peopl may be rent for longer . Doe that mean peopl who rent for extend period , perhap decad  even a lifetim  are forev at a disadvantag ?Argu about whether rent versu buy is a better financi decis is like debat activ versu passiv invest strategi , hedg fund versu mutual fund , Appl versu Googl ,  said Milo M. Benningfield , a financi planner in San Francisco . Somebody go to be right in term of higher return in the futur , but we cant know in advanc who that will be  and it will be tough to quantifi how much risk wa taken along the way.The argument in favor of ownership are persuas , particularli for peopl who expect to stay in place for at least five to seven year but probabl more . A mortgag act like a forc save plan , even if your pay the bank hundr of thousand of dollar in interest for the privileg of build equiti . Call it the cost of enforc a posit behavior .Buy also gener protect consum from rise rent , while tradit mortgag payment remain constant . Then , there is the fact that buyer are use borrow money to purchas an asset that is like to appreci over a long period , though that can backfir as well ( see hous market plung , million of underwat borrow , circa 2008 ) . Be abl to call a place your own ha a real , albeit intang , valu too .How well ani household will fare financi by buy or rent realli depend on factor no one can predict . Other studi have found that renter who invest their down payment and ani save from rent as oppos to own often come out ahead .Either way , most financi profession would caution against view a home purchas as an invest , particularli after factor in the cost of mainten , tax , insur and the high cost of buy and sell , though it difficult not to .It may be hard for peopl live in bubbl market to believ , but , over all , home price in the Unit State have risen just 0.37 percent annual , after inflat , for the last 126 year , accord to calcul by Robert J. Shiller , an economist who receiv the Nobel in econom scienc in 2013 and wrote the book on specul bubbl , Irrat Exuberance.Disregard the special amen that mani peopl valu in homeownership ,  Professor Shiller said , it would be huge better invest in the stock market.And mani peopl do accumul substanti equiti in their home , which often becom a cushi safeti net in retir . A studi by the Harvard Joint Center found that , even after the hous crash , the median household who bought a home after 1999 still accru signific amount of wealth through 2013 ( though white gain more than African-American and Hispan ) .Christoph E. Herbert , manag director of Harvard Joint Center , said he believ the result could be tie , in larg part , to behavior incent . The motiv save up front and the forc save over time ,  he said of accumul a down payment and make mortgag payment .There may also be someth about mani peopl who buy . As Mr. Benningfield point out , they may have other attribut that may contribut to their econom success .Rent can still be financi advantag under certain circumst . Consid the work in 2012 by the academ Eli Beracha of Florida Intern Univers and Ken Johnson of Florida Atlant Univers . They simul a hors race between buyer and renter , and conclud that in mani case , renter came out ahead , at least dure the eight-year stretch they studi .Theoret renter put their down payment in a portfolio that often consist of more than 50 percent stock ( the professor creat a portfolio that approxim the risk of own a home ) , and continu to invest ani save from rent . But thi assum that there are save from rent , which is not alway the case , and that the renter is disciplin enough to actual set the money asid .The authors point , howev , is that peopl often blindli believ that buy is usual the smarter option . Most of the public drive to buy is without look under the hood ,  Professor Johnson said .Anoth studi , from HelloWallet , a unit of Morningstar , came to similar conclus in 2014 when compar a hypothet , moderate-incom famili that bought , with one that rent , in 20 major citi across the countri . The studi project that median-incom famili , or those who earn about $ 50,000 , will often end up with more net wealth if they rent versu own over the 10 year from 2013 to 2022 .But ani number of variabl can quickli shift that calculu , includ the price of the home rel to the rent , whether the famili is affluent enough to benefit from tax save , and the time spent in the home .The longer you stay , the stronger the argument is for buy , all els equal ,  said Aron Szapiro , who conduct the analysi . But he also contend that the tax advantag of homeownership are often oversold , particularli to moderate-incom household .If your tri to determin the right option , some guidepost may help . Mr. Szapiro , for exampl , found that in household with about $ 100,000 in earn , net wealth typic rose more 10 year after buy a home than if they had rent  but onli if the annual rent wa 6 percent or more of the purchas price . So it would pay to buy a $ 600,000 home when rent in the area wa about $ 3,000 a month or more . ( In a coupl of place , includ New York and Washington , he found that it made sens to buy when the cost of rent wa a bit lower rel to home price . )William Bernstein , an invest advis who ha written sever book for do-it-yourself investor , offer anoth rule of thumb : Never pay more than 15 years fair rental valu for ani home , or 180 month of rent .Whi 15 year ? By hi calcul , someon pay more than 180 month of rent might potenti do better by invest in the market , after consid the cost of own .So if an apart would rent for $ 4,000 a month , that mean you shouldnt pay more than $ 720,000 ( $ 4,000 x 180 ) for an equival properti .Perhap easier to digest , Zillow advoc look at how long it would take for buyer to break even , when compar with renter who invest their down payment of 20 percent and ani save in the stock market . Not surprisingli , buyer in place like Brooklyn , Washington and Lo Angel had to wait longer , at least four year .Then there what you feel in the pit of your stomach . To Mr. Austin , hous price in the enclav where he live in Lo Angel feel as if they are in a bubbl , the hous downturn a fade memori . Mani peopl we know ,  he ad , are trip over themselv to buy right now.', 'LO ANGEL  Eugen Kashper look the part of someon who like to throw back a few P.B.R. from time to time  hipster glass , scruffi facial hair , fade T-shirt and jean and well-worn sneaker .Talk to him for a few minut in hi offic here , though , and you hear a shrewd businessman who blith weav in discuss about market share , stock keep unit and distribut channel .The talk is not all talk , either . Mr. Kashper , 46 , is a millionair mani time over , have made a fortun reviv sever all-but-moribund Eastern European breweri .Now he focus on a beer project on anoth contin . The project is Pabst Brew Compani , which declar itself the largest American breweri . He bought Pabst in 2014 with the privat equiti firm TSG Consum Partner for a report $ 700 million , a deal that instantli made him one of the most-watch figur in the beer industri .It also made peopl wonder : What in the world wa he do ?Pabst Blue Ribbon , far and away the company top-sel beer , had a loyal follow among skate punk and ski bum , and some currenc in hipster enclav . But it wa still classifi in the industri as a sub-premium beer and busi wa not boom . The company share of the beer market hover in the low singl digit .Eugen ha a million idea and a lot of energi , and he veri engag ,  said Benj Steinman , publish of Beer Marketer Insight , a trade public , and a longtim observ of the beer market . But I did wonder what he saw in Pabst.Mr. Kashper say he saw a big opportun . Beer , you know , it just fun ,  he said . Now chief execut , he is push an aggress effort to leverag the company distribut network , a part of the busi that had been built up under previou owner , and dust off old beer recip and brand to capit on consum desir for local product .Wer ideal suit for the whole locavor thing ,  he said .Whether he can pull it off is anoth question . After decad of consolid , two big player , Anheuser-Busch InBev and Molson Coor , last year control roughli 70 percent of the American market . Pabst wa in fifth place , with 2.6 percent .But Mr. Kashper offer no hint of doubt , and hi partner say he ha alreadi put the compani on the right path .Brian Krumrei , a manag director at TSG , said profit at Pabst increas by 50 percent in the first year of the firm ownership , though he would not disclos dollar figur .Eugen is a pretti passion guy , and that ha permeat the cultur  the 400 peopl who work at Pabst today are pretti passion about it ,  Mr. Krumrei said . We view that as a huge posit for the busi and it potential.Born in Russia , Mr. Kashper grew up in New Jersey speak Russian and English at home . After graduat from Columbia Univers in 1992 with a degre in East Asian studi , Mr. Kashper , an American citizen , went to work for Ernst & Young , which quickli capit on hi languag skill by send him to Moscow .Soon after that move , he left Ernst & Young and move into the beer industri , get a job as the lead salesman in Eastern Europ for Stroh , an old beer brand coincident now under the Pabst umbrella . He then join forc with two Russian brother , Alexand and Arkadi Lifshit , and in 1998 they co-found the Ivan Taranov Breweri .After a seri of deal in Russia and Eastern Europ that net the partner hundr of million of dollar , the three men creat Oasi Beverag , a brewer and distributor base in Cypru . Oasi also serv as an umbrella for other offshor invest vehicl they control .In Septemb 2014 , Oasi wa announc as the buyer of Pabst , togeth with TSG . News outlet had a field day , portray the deal as a Russian takeov of a quintessenti if somewhat down-market American beer .But a coupl of month later , a differ news releas went out , say that Oasi had never been the buyer of Pabst . Mr. Kashper , it said , wa the buyer .Whi the mistak occur in the first place and whi it took two month to set the record straight remain mysteri . But in so mani way , it match the histori of Pabst , which is also fill with unusu twist and turn .Found in Milwauke in 1844 by Jacob Best Sr. , the breweri had a pretti good run for more than a centuri . But in the 1980 , sale began slide , and in 1985 Pabst land in the hand of Paul Kalmanovitz , a beer entrepreneur from California . He die shortli after acquir the breweri  but not befor he had taken a hacksaw to cost .Mr. Kalmanovitz left hi money to hi pet and hi breweri to a charit foundat , which sold the compani to the billionair investor C. Dean Metropoulo in 2010 , when it had roughli $ 500 million in sale . By that time , Pabst had contract product of it beer to MillerCoor and spent virtual noth on market . Mr. Metropoulo also move the compani from Chicago to Lo Angel .The lack of market becam a sort of renegad promot in and of itself , increas Pabst appeal among consum who were turn off by advertis and look for beer that wa more authentic  even though Pabst no longer made it own beer . Sale rose , at least slightli .Forti year on , mani brand had ground to a halt in term of increas market share , and that where the busi stand today  the biggest beer compani arent sell more beer ,  Mr. Kashper said . Pabst was.The trick now will be to take advantag of those strength . For one thing , the compani is open a microbreweri and tast room at the site of the former Pabst brew complex in Milwauke , where it will serv up special select .Mr. Kashper is also look to sell more of the 77 beer brand and the recip it own  mani of which have not been brew in decad  and ride the coattail of the craft beer craze . Pabst will soon start produc Rainier Pale Mountain Ale at a breweri in Washington State , for exampl , use a recip deriv from the one for a Rainier beer that wa last brew in the 1930 and 1940 . Other brand includ Lone Star , Schlitz , Olympia , Nation Bohemian , Colt 45 , Schmidt and Pearl .We can take advantag of the heritag embed in our brand ,  Mr. Kashper said . We dont have to spend money convinc consum our brand are authent  they alreadi know they are.Stephen Rannekleiv , an invest analyst at Rabobank , said these old brand might put Pabst in a good posit .Pabst in the past ha been abl to buck trend by play up it retro feel and be a littl offbeat , and those same thing are help today ,  he said .The compani is also put more energi into leverag it distribut system , which had been nurtur and hone by Mr. Metropoulo .Serendipit , he found one hit to pump through the system right after buy Pabst , in Not Your Father Root Beer , a hard or alcohol soda made by Small Town Breweri that becam the beer industry sleeper success stori of 2015 . The product help rais Pabst overal sale in 2015 by 20 percent and push it market share up by a percentag point  even as sale of it main brand declin .But Mr. Kashper , with hi fade Pabst Blue Ribbon logo T-shirt and dilapid sneaker , say he not go to forget about the company primari brand , either .Wev becom an afford , lighter beer that appeal to peopl who like craft beer ,  Mr. Kashper said . And , look , sell sub-premium beer is a veri profit busi for us , no matter what els we may be doing.', 'Andrew Sullivan , a pioneer in polit commentari dure the earli day of blog but an infrequ heard voic in the current elect cycl , ha join New York Magazin as a contribut editor .Mr. Sullivan will write featur on polit and the larger cultur ,  the magazin said .

Potenti combin , includ a much-rumor deal between Vodafon , the telecom base in London , and Liberti Global , the cabl compani control by John C. Malon , have also fail to emerg .Antitrust concern were rais at the time of Orange propos takeov of Bouygu Telecom in Januari , but both side said on Friday that the failur to reach term on the deal , and not potenti competit issu , had scuttl the takeov .In particular , Bouygu , a French conglomer that own Bouygu Telecom , said in a statement that it had fail to reach agreement on it stake in the new entiti and on the valuat of the company telecom unit .The compani said it also had concern about whether the deal would be approv by the country author .Analyst expect Orang to sell off part of the enlarg entiti to nation rival to win regulatori approv . It also remain unclear how much of a stake the French govern , which own a minor stake in Orang , would have retain if the takeov had been approv .In a market where the possibl of consolid is now rule out for the long term , Bouygu Telecom will continu it stand-alon strategi ,  the compani said in it statement .In respons , Orang said it would now focu on invest in it own telecom network across Franc .The propos deal would have creat one of France largest telecom oper as the industri face a cutthroat price war that ha pit Orang against upstart rival like Iliad and Numericable-SFR .Orang ha more than 260 million subscrib worldwid , includ roughli 28 million in Franc , while Bouygu Telecom ha 14 million custom , all in Franc .Thi is not the first time that Bouygu Telecom ha been at the heart of takeov talk .Two year ago , the compani fail to acquir SFR , anoth French carrier , in a lengthi takeov battl with Altic , the Amsterdam-list cabl compani that control the French cabl oper Numeric .After month of negoti , Vivendi , the owner of SFR , final agre to sell SFR to Altic for about 17 billion .After Bouygu Telecom failur to acquir SFR , analyst said that it did not have the financi muscl to compet against better-financ rival , includ Orang .In 2015 , Bouygu Telecom also reject a 10 billion takeov from Altic , whose owner  the French billionair Patrick Drahi  ha also expand into the Unit State by acquir the American cabl oper Suddenlink Commun and Cablevis .That 2015 deal would have combin two of France largest mobil provid  Numericable-SFR and Bouygu Telecom  to overtak Orang as France largest cellphon compani .', 'The emerg of the Internet and variou form of digit product and distribut have had a profound and well-docu impact on the media busi .In the news sector , an area of high relev for the strength of democrat institut , the chang have been particularli signific . The sourc and natur of these shift have been the subject of continu discuss .The main structur develop ha been the reduct in fixed-cost invest requir to get into the news busi . In 1982 , a billion-dollar invest from Gannett wa requir to bring USA Today to sustain  and no similar feat wa ever tri again . By contrast , The Huffington Post , BuzzFe , Vox , Politico , Quartz , Busi Insid , Mail Onlin , Slate and the dozen of other digit news franchis begun in the last decad collect requir significantli less capit .What more , the low cost of digit commun ha eas the abil of journalist to gain access to and analyz vast trove of inform . Contrast the pain that Daniel Ellsberg had to go to in order to make a few photocopi of the Pentagon Paper with the eas with which Edward Snowden download an estim 1.5 million document .Of cours , the reduct of barrier to entri in the news busi had a tangibl cost to those who had benefit from the barrier . Incumb local news monopoli , which still account for most domest newspap circul , onc enjoy upward of 40 percent profit margin . Although they remain more lucr than mani media busi like movi , music and book , their profit ha been slash in half or more . Some margin newspap have shut down or reduc their frequenc of distribut . And even the strongest franchis have reduc the magnitud of their commit to investig journal as profit margin have been squeez .The shift in the news sector ha it share of winner and loser , but a fair-mind person is like to conclud that the net impact on the public ha been posit  there is vastli more inform avail , it is easier to reach and there are a multipl of new distribut outlet .Julia Cag , a French econom professor and author of Save the Media : Capit , Crowdfund , and Democracy ( Harvard/Belknap ) , see no such nuanc in the current state of affair and could not disagre more .Accord to Professor Cag , the news media face an existenti crisis that ha grown radic wors in recent years. Furthermor , the failur to act , she argu , threaten to undermin our participatori democraci , by let news becom a mere toy for billionair in search of influenc ,  a playground for entrepreneur in search of entertainment or a hunt ground for specul in search of lucr deals.Her conclus is that the onli way to continu to produc free , high-qual , unbias inform in a varieti of form to ensur that it is access to all who want it is to transfer ownership to an entir new corpor form which she call a nonprofit media organ  in which employe , manag and reader share govern respons .It would be easi to dismiss Save the Media as the anachronist muse of a European socialist with littl applic to the American context . For instanc , Professor Cag review a wide rang of newspap subsidi program in forc in Europ and conclud with a call for a simplifi and enhanc system in which subsidi are dole out in proport to circul . It is safe to say that Washington will not be cut Gannett  the highli profit circul leader  a check ani time soon .Professor Cag over-the-top hyperbol and frequent misstat of fact also lend themselv to caricatur . For instanc , she cite the Koch Brother as the most strike example of her assert that it is no accid that the same peopl are often both larg polit contributor and major media investors. Whatev one think of the Koch , they have not to date invest in ani media properti .The underli argument of Professor Cag , howev , have found a surpris level of sympathi in the Unit State . The idea that not onli is there a news crisi , but that there is a need for govern to remedi the impact of the Internet , is widespread . Both the Feder Commun Commiss and the Feder Trade Commiss have held multipl hear on suggest topic like How Will Journal Surviv the Internet Age ?  And The Wall Street Journal ha publish commentari by the financi Steven Rattner echo Professor Cag argument that some form of nonprofit organ is need to protect our democraci .Even if one accept that there is a news crisi ,  as mani appar suppos , the creation of nonprofit media organ would not provid a solut for two reason . First , for all the complex detail on how employe and reader would get disproport larg vote right as compar with larger investor , almost noth is said about how govern would actual work to ensur high qualiti and independ . The book is silent about precis how a board of director would be organ and what role it would play .There is reason to be concern that thi vagu around journalist and manag decision-mak indic that life under the envis polit collect of variou constitu may not be as utopian as portray .A small scandal erupt last year in Franc around the public of Save the Media. Professor Cag , it turn out , is marri to Thoma Piketti , the world-fam author of the 2013 best seller , Capit in the 21st Century.

By contrast , the company overal sale have increas 9 percent .Now , the plant that build the 200 , just outsid Detroit in Sterl Height , Mich. , is idl , and it 3,200 worker have been laid off nearli everi week sinc Januari .In a red-hot market for new vehicl , it stand out as one of the few auto plant in the countri that is run well below full capac .About 1,300 of those worker will go on indefinit layoff in Juli , as the Sterl Height plant downsiz to a singl shift and prepar to wind down product of the 200 .Mr. Marchionn confirm thi week that the plant would be convert to produc Ram pickup  Fiat Chrysler top-sel vehicl .

Low ga price also help shift consum away from car like the 200 to sport util vehicl and truck .The market wa stellar , but the product didnt live up to the hype ,  said Jack R.

In addit , it anonymous-sound name and convent style never click with consum .You cant make a first impress a second time ,  he said . And when the 200 came out , peopl found it lack , whether it wa the transmiss or the rear seat room or just the qualiti baggag attach to Chrysler cars.Instead of force-feed the car on the market with higher incent , Fiat Chrysler ha slash product to a minimum . The next step is exit the segment entir , although Mr. Marchionn ha suggest the compani may contract with anoth automak to suppli it with a replac .Either way , the fall of the 200 repres a rare defeat for Fiat Chrysler . The company sale in recent year have consist outpac the growth of the overal domest market , and it pickup and Jeep sport util vehicl are among the industry fastest-sel vehicl .In the industri citi of Sterl Height , the 200 wa view as a savior for the local assembl plant , and a sign that the domest auto industri had weather the last recess .The 200 hasnt perform as well as it wa hope ,  said Mayor Michael C.

It is one of the few instanc in the industri in recent year in which worker have been indefinit laid off becaus of poor sale .Worker at the plant have ridden a roller coaster of emot , date to Chrysler bankruptci in 2009 , when the factori wa a candid to be close perman .Chrysler merger with Fiat , and the introduct of the 200 , save the plant from extinct then . But the recent layoff and product shutdown put it futur in doubt .We had peopl worri about their job ,  said Ivan Garrett , a 23-year veteran worker at the plant . We didnt know what wa go to come next.Becaus of hi senior , Mr. Garrett will not face an indefinit layoff thi summer . He said he wa hope that the convers to pickup truck product would bring all the employe back to work eventu .And although it appear that Fiat Chrysler ambit to expand it car busi have stall , the compani is eager to continu it shift toward manufactur more pickup and sport util vehicl .In 2018 , the Sterl Height plant will build the next gener of the Ram . The factori that current build the truck , in the nearbi citi of Warren , will get a new Jeep product to replac it .The whole purpos of the realign is not to lose ani product of Jeep and Ram ,  said Richard Palmer , Fiat Chrysler chief financi offic .As Mr. Marchionn remark to analyst , replac the 200 with more pickup truck is a step toward focus on the relev portion of our activities  mean more truck and fewer car .It refreshingli honest that he admit that make car doesnt make a lot of econom sens , and truck do ,  Mr. Nerad said .

Given the strength of the rumor of hi departur that have been circul sinc Januari , thi may go down as the most anticlimact fashion announc ever made .But despit the fact that it happen on April Fools Day ( a coincid that probabl escap no one ) , the news ha seriou implic . Mr. Sliman is the fourth design at a major fashion hous to recent leav hi post after less than five year . Last Juli , Alexand Wang left Balenciaga after three year ; in Octob , Raf Simon left Christian Dior after the same amount of time ; and in Februari , Stefano Pilati left Zegna . Mr. Sliman ha been at the helm of YSL sinc 2012 .Mr. Sliman accomplish a lot in that time , transform the brand reput as well as it financi fortun . Saint Laurent is now the fastest-grow line in the luxuri portfolio of it parent compani , Kere , report slightli less than 1 billion euro , or about $ 1.14 billion , in revenu for 2015 , up 38 percent from 2014 . Saint Laurent now account for 12 percent of sale by Kering luxuri brand and 8 percent of the group total sale .To do so , Mr. Sliman also creat a model of an all-pow aesthet mastermind that ha sinc been adopt by Alessandro Michel at Gucci and ha becom the dream of mani design . But the idea that the brand transform is complet , as the news releas suggest ( to be specif , the statement character Mr. Slimane stay as a four-year mission , which ha led to the complet reposit of the brand ) , and can simpli be hand over to anoth design , is a troubl one .Yet thi seem to have becom the convent wisdom of the industri . Gildo Zegna , chief execut of the Italian men wear label Ermenegildo Zegna , said someth veri similar when Mr. Pilati left : We want to develop a strong point of view in fashion , and for Zegna to be a show not to be miss in Milan . We have reach thi object faster than expected. On to the next ! At a lunch to start Milan Fashion Week in Februari , I sat next to Franois-Henri Pinault , chief execut of Kere , and ask him about such abbrevi relationship , as one doe when face with that kind of opportun . He shrug and said , That is the normal life cycl of modern luxury.Let hope that isnt true .Fashion ha been infect by the contemporari diseas of short-term . And thi mean fashion writ larg : not onli execut on the corpor side , who in public compani necessarili have to think in report quarter , but also the member of the design side , which is not exempt here . There is a tendenc to blame corpor moneymen for the evil of a system that is crush the poor creativ flower of a design , wring all the invent out of him or her , but it is increasingli clear that that is an antiqu idea .Mr. Simon left ; he wa not forc out . Mr. Sliman , with hi insist on total control and refus to live in Pari , instead remain in Lo Angel and make the brand come to him , is no one idea of a pushov . The talk surround hi contract negoti center on specul about what he want ( supposedli more money ) , not what he wa be requir to do .The relationship horizon line on both side seem to be shrink . Inde , in multipl convers with fashion chief execut sinc all thi began , the answer that keep come up when they are ask whi they dont give design longer contract  five year , seven year ( the averag length of a creativ director contract current is three )  is that the design wont sign them ; that the design want the freedom to renegoti ( or leav ) . You can understand it , to a certain extent : If designers work increas sale at a global mega-brand to a meaning level , they want their salari to reflect the success . One execut told me design he spoke to would be happi to sign one-year contract if they could .Compar thi to the length of time founder such as Yve Saint Laurent himself wa at hi hous ( 40 year ) , or Valentino Garavani ( 48 year ) , or Hubert de Givenchi ( 43 year ) . One of the reason those brand had worth even after their founder retir  the reason they were valuabl enough to be bought by conglomer and privat equiti firm such as their current owner , Kere , the Qatari invest firm Mayhoola , and Mot Hennessey Loui Vuitton respect  wa that their good will and aesthet equiti had been defin and built over decad . That is what wa purchas , as much as the name themselv . Becaus that is what attract not just one gener of shopper , but the next and the next .Creat an imag for a brand and truli embed it in the life of a consum take invest not just in renov but in the relationship  between brand and individu , and design and brand . After all , the product themselv requir invest . They are not cheap . Consum have to believ they will hold their mean over time . And the mean is creat by the design .Modern luxuri theori ha it that the brand ha to be greater than ani individu , but we should not forget that brand are given their person and their depth by the peopl who make them . They arent caretak ; they are content creator ( and not in the social media mean of the word ) . Comm de Garon is Comm de Garon becaus of it founder and design , Rei Kawakubo ; Ralph Lauren becaus of Ralph Lauren ; Giorgio Armani becaus of Giorgio Armani ; Chanel becaus of Coco Chanel and now the design Karl Lagerfeld .Inde , though the latter did not creat the style of the maison he took on in 1983 , he ha work within it vernacular for over 30 year . As a result , it is still clear what the brand stand for , and you can buy into that valu system or use it to telegraph your own . Similarli , Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli , creativ director of Valentino sinc 2008 , have succeed in establish a modern charact for the compani that speak to the legaci of it founder , root as it is in beauti and decor , while also give it a reson in contemporari cultur by combin a certain rigor of line with elabor craftsmanship . But it ha evolv over season  their first few show look veri differ  and if they had depart after Year 3 , their contribut would have had veri littl impact . It would have been a blip , rather than an ident .If the valu system a brand repres chang , and chang veri dramat , as it did at YSL under Mr. Sliman , who crush it botox Le Smoke under a highli merchandis California youthquak truck , it : a ) take a while for the world to adjust ( rememb the initi shock ! horror ! at hi grung grrl on the runway in Season 2 ) ; and b ) can give consum whiplash if it then segu into someth els entir .As to what might lie ahead , at least for YSL , rumor are center on Anthoni Vaccarello , a young Belgian-Italian design whose last show wa veri 1980 rocker  in part becaus it doesnt seem a huge departur from the Sliman aesthet , though it is more aggress sexi and less holist . Kere said it would make an announc in due course.Mr. Sliman ha been , characterist , silent about hi plan . There wa talk he might go to Dior , which is still search for a design , but it is even more like he will segu into the art world . Hi creativ univers ha alway seem more like perform art than simpli cloth .Thi week , two new ad campaign , shot by Mr. Sliman , were preview by YSL : one featur Jane Birkin in a Smoke suit , and one featur Cara Delevingn in look from Mr. Slimane last show . There will be a bridg period where , at least from the outsid , everyth will look veri much the same . And it hard to imagin that given the cost of Mr. Slimane reinvent , which extend beyond the runway to store , furnitur for the store and a new htel particuli in Pari , Kere would be prepar to do the same for whoever come next .Ideal , that person would stay longer than three year . But a certain preced ha been set . The unsettl prospect of a fashion world of free agent , more than ani singl look , may be the legaci of Mr. Sliman . And it unclear where in that scenario ani long-term profit lie .', 'OTTAWA  BlackBerry attempt to reviv it once-mighti smartphon busi by use Google Android oper system is off to a disappoint start .BlackBerri said on Friday that despit the move , it sold just 600,000 phone dure it most recent quarter , which end Feb. 29 , a drop of about 100,000 phone from the previou quarter .It did not say how mani of those phone were the new Android model , known as Priv .

It wa their first time apart , and they struggl . Shortli into the first semest , one start to suffer from anxieti attack and began drink and take drug to deal with them .She first use marijuana , her mother said . But midway through the year , thi daughter , who had been in church group while grow up outsid of Boston , began take hallucinogen drug such as LSD sever time a week . Her parent knew someth wa go on , but chalk it up to her parti like mani freshmen .Then that spring , she took so much LSD at a concert she end up be admit to the psychiatr ward at the Univers of Miami Hospit .That began a two-year odyssey of residenti and outpati therapi for their daughter . While she is now in recoveri and is attend a differ colleg , it wa a difficult , uncertain and expens time for her famili .She healthi , strong and in a good place ,  Mrs. Frawley said . It wa a long and twist journey.And it wa one , Mrs. Frawley estim , that cost her famili over $ 200,000 in less than two year .Treatment for drug and alcohol addict is incred expens , often rise to ten of thousand of dollar a month for residenti treatment . And even peopl who have good insur that will pay for such program often face limit on how much that insur will cover .Yet peopl like the Frawley , who could afford treatment for their daughter , still face the issu of find the right treatment .That is where a small group of peopl have step up as consult to guid famili through the mani option for treatment .I wa abl to call my friend and say , I need that consult right now ,  Mrs. Frawley said . It wa just by luck that I happen to know someon who had use a consultant.And she credit that consult with her daughter success and for guid her through the labyrinthin process of find the right program for both her daughter and , by extens , the famili .Tradit , referr from a person doctor or psychologist combin with word of mouth have been how famili choos treatment program . But consult say they can provid a broader and more object select of option and , in some case , even the name of specif clinician .Do thi research on your own can be a superscari process ,  said Mike Ferguson , founder of FBHC Advisor , in Santa Monica , Calif. , who work with the Frawley . You have a financi advis . Whi wouldnt you want someon who know the field and can help you that way ? Thi help is not cheap , and it is on top of whatev the treatment center itself cost . Mr. Ferguson fee are on the lower end , at about $ 10,000 a year . Bill Messing , founder of Aureu , an addict consult group in Minneapoli , charg $ 5,000 to $ 10,000 to set up an initi plan of care and then $ 5,000 a month for close monitor for six month or so after that .Our model is earli intervent ,  Mr. Messing said . We know pretti quickli when someon relaps . If you can catch someon in the first coupl of week when they relaps , it better than not know for six months.Sam Dresser , a princip at Clere Consult , said hi firm sought to work with the extend famili for as much as two year to educ all of them on how to better handl the addict or mental health need of the famili member . Like a lawyer , he charg an hourli rate  $ 325  that typic add up to $ 20,000 to $ 80,000 the first year .Debbi Connolli , whose son wa in and out of treatment for six year befor final get to a recoveri state , said she spent more than $ 500,000 on hi treatment . And there were sever misstep along the way , includ bring him home from treatment too earli against the advic of counselor .In gener , the recommend were realli great ,  she said of the consult she use . I didnt even know where to start . You have all those program at your fingertip and then it still a crapshoot.The consultants argument is that even great treatment program may not be the right fit for a particular person .Arden OConnor , founder of the OConnor Profession Group , which consult on an array of issu from addict to eat disord , said her firm focus on coordin care and coach famili . But that , she said , can includ help select , from a list of hundr , a center to treat an eat disord to arrang round-the-clock monitor of a hedg fund execut who doesnt want a relaps .Sometim it veri basic , and they just need to stop drink ,  Ms. OConnor said . A lot of time , it crisi manag . Wer help the individu with short- and long-term goals.Mr. Dresser said hi process involv the whole famili . He make sure famili know theyr go to have to do work on their behavior , too .When you tell peopl theyr go to spend two day go to school with you and the other side of the phone say , I want you to grab my son and put him in treatment ,  that not our client ,  Mr. Dresser said . We want to be part of a bigger solut for famili . Pluck him out of the famili and put him into treatment is not where the field is these days.Likewis , Mr. Ferguson said it wa import for famili to set realist goal for what they expect to accomplish . Treatment is an invest , and your due an outcom from that invest ,  he said . But what is the expect outcom ? Sobrieti ? A certain mental health outcom ? It tailor a path with a famili and realli look at it like an investment.But famili need to be readi , too . Mr. Messing said hi strategi wa to employ therapeut leverag  which mean set firm consequ for peopl who stray from recoveri  to alter someone behavior . Not everi famili can stay the cours .And these consult , who are work on behalf of the entir famili and not just the individu in treatment , are not alway appreci at some treatment center .A lot of case manag or standard health care servic provid are veri standoffish with anyon in the financi realm ,  said Jim Grubman , founder of FamilyWealth Consult . They see advis as onli act in their own self-interest . They defend confidenti to an extrem . They dont understand the collabor natur of how peopl work realli well togeth at thi high level of wealth and privat banking.An addit problem for wealthi famili is that the staff of some program can treat wealthier peopl differ by be excess deferenti or critic , which can be bad for recoveri . Consult , he said , help find program with better-train staff .It make a huge differ ,  he said . Most peopl dont understand the wealthi and what their live are realli like . Theyr just deal with their stereotypes.The consult said they let famili know they can not alway swoop in and make everyth right . Ms. OConnor said failur wa part of thi busi , and she recal a situat where a wealthi man would go to alcohol treatment but check himself out after a few day .We tri numer type of intervent ,  she said . He never embrac recoveri . He still not live a life of purpos . He still get into crises.', 'LONDON  Home Retail Group said on Friday that it board of director would recommend that sharehold accept a takeov offer from J Sainsburi , one of Britain largest groceri store chain .The cash-and-stock deal valu Home Retail at 1.4 billion pound , or about $ 2 billion .

Jobless is hover near the low level last reach in 2007 befor the economy downturn .And perhap most significantli , the armi of unemploy peopl who gave up and drop out of the job market is not onli look for work , but actual find it .The 215,000 jump in payrol in March report by the Labor Depart on Friday cap the best two-year period for hire sinc the late 1990 , while the proport of American in the labor forc  which had been on a downward trajectori sinc 2001 and an even steeper slide sinc 2008  hit a two-year high .It realli a best-cas scenario ,  said Michel Meyer , deputi head of Unit State econom at Bank of America Merril Lynch . I wa particularli encourag by the pickup in labor forc participation.The underli strength appar in the report for March reinforc grow evid that the economi , despit a host of remain ill , is now consist move in the right direct .Thi is close to a Goldilock scenario ,  said Scott Clemon , chief invest strategist at Brown Brother Harriman . He note that hire and wage gain were healthi in March , but not so robust as to ignit inflat fear and tempt the Feder Reserv to move more quickli to rais rate and temper growth .To be sure , the damag from the financi crisi and the sever recess it spawn is still not fulli heal . Even with improv of the past six month , the proport of American in the labor forc remain significantli below where it wa when the recess began at the end of 2007 .The labor forc in the last few month ha seen signific gain ,  said Clair McKenna , senior polici analyst with the Nation Employ Law Project , an advocaci group for lower-wag worker . Thing are move in the right direct , but veri slowly.At the same time , while some of the highest-paid employe on Wall Street and at mani lead compani have enjoy big jump in compens , most worker have experienc onli veri modest wage gain , heighten worri about incom inequ .The American economi still face fundament headwind that are not like to abat soon  like a persist trade gap , low product and the long-term eros of factori job that provid an econom lifelin to worker without a colleg degre .In fact , the manufactur sector wa one of the few weak spot in the economi last month , lose 29,000 job .But compani in the busi of provid health care , leisur and hospit and retail each gain more than 40,000 job in March .

But even that wa a posit indic , analyst said , sinc it wa the uptick in new entrant to the labor forc that mostli account for the rise rather than job loss .If anyth , Friday report portray an economi gradual return to a more normal trajectori , while so far avoid the bubblelik excess that prevail in the late 1990 and just befor the Great Recess in Decemb 2007 .The last two year have been the best sinc 1998 and 1999 , and that say a lot ,  said Nariman Behravesh , chief economist at IH , a research and consult firm . Those were boom year that we look back on veri fondli , so to have that level of job growth again is pretti remarkable.As a result , the econom backdrop of the presidenti campaign is also start to shift .

New hire for StratEx help desk , who have been work for the same amount of time , command less than half that annual .Until recent , the proport of American either employ or activ look for a job wa fall . But it appear to have bottom out at 62.4 percent in Septemb 2015 . The 63 percent particip rate is now back to where it wa in Februari 2014 .Although it ha been a modest improv , it wa enough to draw the attent of Janet L. Yellen , the Fed chairwoman .

We will take our cue about the overal strength of the economi base on that.Mr. Gapen , like mani on Wall Street , urg the Fed to let the good time roll .M .

In addit , the resid will often need to adjust variabl aluminum shutter on the home tint window and door to regul sun and airflow . Catch the wind maxim cross ventil and keep the air sweet ,  the architect said .Dress in a fit cotton jacket and tie , Mr. Pomeroy , who write book about sustain design , doe not break a sweat as he walk from room to room , demonstr how the shutter oper . He believ the thermal comfort level will be accept to famili acclim to tropic condit .For those who prefer cooler temperatur , he suggest switch on the air-condit unit in the live room or fan in each bedroom , even though that would rais the carbon footprint . It about provid choic ,  he said .Mr. Pomeroy inspir for passiv design , such as the adjust shutter , stem from Singapore sought-aft black-and-whit bungalow built by the British throughout the island in the 1800 and earli 1900 . Strong idea are one that stand the test of time ,  he said . Build of the past should influenc the present.Ms. Young agre . The way the breez ventil part of the hous , thank to the way the window and door are posit and design , is reminisc of how my ancestor live ,  she reflect . I found thi both clever and comfort at the same time.The home orient also minim heat from the sun , whether from the east or the west , and maxim ventil crosswind . Bedroom wall directli face the sun have no window . Rather , they featur funki curved-wood wall that seamlessli unit ceil and floor . Other affect wall abut a high grassi mound . The hous also featur gener roof overhang , high ceil and big veranda .To prefabr the home and cut construct time in half , Mr. Pomeroy design three shallow floor plate ,  which run side by side and give room optim natur light .The front plate includ an ampl entranc hall and a guest room , which ha a frost glass door and may be better use as a famili room or librari on ground floor . Directli abov is the master bedroom , with an adjoin bathroom and walk-in closet .The middl plate featur an outdoor pool that work as an intern courtyard for entertain . When door on either side are open , the space accommod up to 60 guest . It also offer an adjac wind staircas lead to a huge , round skylight that could one day becom the open to a rooftop terrac .The third plate includ a soundproof movi room , a live room and a partial galley kitchen , as well as a wet kitchen appoint with function but not high-end applianc and cabinet . Abov are three modest-s bedroom with bathroom and an outdoor deck  complet with a larg bathtub .When Ms. Young , who is an account , put B Hous up for rent , she hope to achiev a bit more than the market rate , which is $ 10,000 to $ 11,000 a month , perhap from American or European tenant who are environment mind .And when it come time to sell , Ms. Young expect to make a handsom profit .

But MetLif also contend that insur is a more stabl busi that is not as vulner to the sort of run that can take down a bank .Notabl , the feder court rule probabl doe not give tradit bank , like JPMorgan Chase , a pathway to shed stricter regul .The Fed ha requir the largest bank to have significantli higher level of capit than smaller lender . But the Fed doe not need to go through the Financi Stabil Oversight Council when identifi which tradit bank have to oper under these more stringent requir .Still , the true impact of the MetLif court rule wont be known until it is unseal , as earli as next week .Even a rule that disagre with the council method , rather than it right to identifi system riski firm , could substanti restrain the council and embolden the anti-overhaul forc to strike elsewher .Hous Republican , for instanc , have said that the Financi Stabil Oversight Council , the entiti that design nonbank , is not transpar and ha too much power , a critic they have also made of the Consum Financi Protect Bureau , anoth entiti set up by Dodd-Frank ( to protect consum against unfair lend practic ) .A rule that requir the council to jump through a lot more hoop  like perform cost analys  could slow it down consider .

It founder , a 32-year-old Stanford dropout name Elizabeth Holm , ha grace variou magazin cover and is a billionair on paper .But news report have rais question about whether Therano can do what it say it can .Earlier thi week , research at the Icahn School of Medicin at Mount Sinai publish the first independ assess of Therano , find that it produc more irregular result than two more convent laboratori .The new inspect report follow a much shorter one releas by feder regul in Januari , which cite Therano for variou defici , includ one that pose immedi jeopardi to patient health and safety.The new inspect report is reveal becaus it contain data from Theranos own intern test . Howev , some of the data is redact to protect what Therano view as it confidenti inform , make it difficult in some case to tell what test is be refer to and whether the test wa done use Theranos proprietari technolog or machin it bought from lab equip supplier like Siemen .Perhap the most seriou find involv a test of blood clot use on patient who take the blood thinner warfarin . Too much warfarin can lead to intern bleed and too littl can leav a patient with an increas risk of a stroke . Therano execut have acknowledg thi wa the test cite for the immedi jeopardi to patient .The new report say that some equip for thi test wa run numer time without obtain accept qualiti control . Yet result were provid to patient . The document said that a review of the result from April to Septemb of last year found that 81 of 81 report final patient result were not accur .Therano also provid some result of vitamin B12 test to patient , despit warn that qualiti control wa off .The report also contain what appear to be comparison between result from Theranos proprietari technolog and the same sampl run on convent equip . It note that the result should have been within 20 percent of one anoth .But for one test the result differ by 21 to 130 percent base on nine random sampl . For anoth , the differ rang from 21 to 39 percent , and for a third it rang from 22 to 146 percent . The thing that were measur in these test were redact .The document also contain Theranos respons to the find .

Nissan , for exampl , said the tactic help make more car avail for rent while a vehicl is be servic by a dealer . And not all automak engag in the practic . Honda is one that offer littl to no incent for dealer-purchas loaner vehicl .We will never pursu artifici sale goal that could hurt resal valu and the loyalti of our custom ,  said Jeff Conrad , gener manag for the Honda brand .Gener Motor , the largest domest automak , Toyota and Fiat Chrysler offer subsidi so dealer can oper loaner fleet , but their program are more limit .The practic ha come under scrutini becaus of a lawsuit by two dealer who assert that they were pressur to falsifi sale by Fiat Chrysler . No legal challeng are known regard purchas by dealer .Ford did not immedi respond to request for comment , but dealer said their program were more modest .But for those automak that use the tactic , mani analyst see a motiv beyond keep more loaner car .There is a lot of econom pressur to grow ,  said David Luca , an analyst at Autodata Corpor , a market research . While car compani have long use test-driv and rental fleet to manag sale and inventori , such effort in the end do the same thing .They make the number look good ,  he said .Exactli how mani vehicl are sold thi way is not known . Dealer estim they amount to 10 percent or more of Nissan and Kia sale over the cours of a year , and a higher percentag of BMW sale . But in an industri where automak fight for everi sale , the number can add up .The aggress tactic recal method use a decad ago , when the industri wa also at a peak . Back then , Gener Motor , Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler rais sale by sell ten of thousand of car to rental car compani and offer big discount like employe price .Those action ate into profit margin and contribut to the sever of the industry eventu crash .Today techniqu , by contrast , are harder to spot than those blatant cash-back offer and sale to rental compani .Last month , Kia Motor increas sale by tell it 755 dealer in the Unit State they were each clear to creat computer sale record for as mani as nine vehicl from their inventori  without have custom for them .In a memo sent to dealer on March 14 , Kia instruct them to hold those car for a minimum of 15 day as test drive model .

They can no longer be advertis as new car becaus they were mark as sold under Kia test-driv sale program , a salesman , Bang Nguyen , explainKia confirm the outlin of the test drive sale program , but did not respond to request for addit detail .BMW regularli pay dealer to buy car and keep them as demonstr model or lend them to custom who are have their vehicl servic .But sever year ago , BMW creat a categori in it sale report system call Specialti 8 , accord to commun between BMW and it dealer . These vehicl are count as sold for BMW monthli total , but remain on the lot and continu to be offer as new car , the dealer said . BMW typic pay the dealer $ 1,000 to $ 3,000 for each Specialti 8 car mark as sold .On Thursday , the day befor monthli sale are report on Friday , BMW made a one-day offer to dealer to entic them to buy car for loaner fleet . A BMW spokesman , Kenn Spark , confirm that Specialti 8 wa a subcategory for sale of vehicl use as demonstr model and test drive .Nissan Motor ha dealer buy car for use in what it call dealer rental fleet . The car are suppos to remain in rental servic for 90 day , and some are in fact rent by dealership custom . But occasion Nissan waiv the 90-day rule and clear dealer to sell their rental model as use car , although mani were never driven while in the rental fleet . Nissan then requir dealer to buy addit new vehicl to restock the rental fleet , which increas monthli sale .Nissan enact such a waiver last month .THI IS HUGE for dealer that have a ton of Nissan Rental sit around ! ! ,  the compani told dealer in a March 9 memo .

Today , one in five peopl do not have access to broadband at home , and the vast major of those disconnect are poor . Onli about 40 percent of peopl earn less than $ 25,000 a year can afford broadband while 95 percent of all household make over $ 150,000 have high-spe Internet at home , the F.C.C . said .Start in Decemb , those elig for program like the Supplement Nutrit Assist Program and tribal and veteran benefit , will be abl to appli for the subsidi . The fund can be use for wireless or fixed-wir broadband . The F.C.C . said it would aim to keep the budget of the subsidi program under $ 2.25 billion , money that is provid through line-item charg on wireless and Internet bill .Among the biggest concern is how financi disadvantag famili are be strain by their inabl to connect to the Internet at home .

The Republican commission , who ultim vote against the subsidi , said the F.C.C . need to put a lower and hard cap on the Lifelin program budget . Start in 1985 to bring phone servic to low-incom famili , Lifelin later ad subsidi for mobil phone servic , but some home start double-bil the program and the budget for the fund balloon .The commission failur to clean up the wast , fraud and abus in the program put the entir enterpris in jeopardi ,  said Ajit Pai , a Republican F.C.C . commission .The F.C.C . plan to appoint a third-parti administr to check for double-bil or other instanc of fraud .The agency two Republican commission also vote against the broadband privaci rule , which have drawn strong protest from cabl and telecom firm .

Accord to poll data by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institut , 64 percent of the state resid oppos discrimin on the basi of sexual orient . Support in North Carolina for gay marriag last year reach 44 percent , accord to Public Polici Poll .Which make Governor McCrory swift sign of the bill all the more puzzl .

If the Anbang-l consortium win it bid contest against Marriott Intern and enter into an agreement to acquir Starwood , that agreement will becom the main way Starwood would forc Anbang to complet the transact if financ issu or ani other come up . As with ani agreement , if one parti fail to honor the term , Starwood would have to sue Anbang to enforc the deal .Thi is where the problem aris .If Starwood won a lawsuit in the Unit State , it would have to enforc the judgment in China , where Anbang and it asset are . Good luck with that .China is notori for it weak rule of law , and whether or not a Chines court would actual enforc a Unit State judgment against Anbang is unknown .Thi is a good lesson for anyon deal with compani outsid the Unit State : Have a great claim is meaningless unless you have a pocket to get money from .There are way that American compani tri to get around thi issu . One method is for compani to agre that ani disput will be arbitr . Enforc of arbitr award is typic easier becaus mani countri are parti to the 1958 Unit Nation Convent on the Recognit and Enforc of Foreign Arbitr Award , known as the New York Convent . Thi treati requir ani countri that is a parti to it to honor an arbitr award and enforc it without tri the case again in court .The treati is view as a more certain way to enforc foreign judgment . Becaus of thi , mani deal with compani locat in countri with weak rule of law use arbitr . Most cross-bord deal with Russian compani , for exampl , are subject to arbitr in case of disput rather than litig in Russia itself .China is a parti to thi treati , so mani agreement with Chines compani contain arbitr provis . But there is a common belief that Chines court will not enforc these award . And in ani event , the idea of go through arbitr and then tri to enforc a $ 14 billion deal in a Chines court is ludicr . Starwood cant wait the year thi would take .So , Starwood lawyer are assum that Starwood will realli have no recours in China to enforc it agreement if Anbang decid to breach it .All is not lost , howev . Starwood lawyer will look for Anbang to put up collater  mainli American asset . These will secur ani judgment so that Starwood would not have to turn to China .The problem is that Anbang ha limit asset in the Unit State . It own the Waldorf Astoria , which it bought for $ 1.95 billion , and ha agre to buy Strateg Hotel and Resort from Blackston for $ 6.5 billion . But these asset are not enough . In both case , Anbang most like borrow heavili to acquir them and they will not be avail to meet the full purchas price for Starwood .Thi leav the last option . Starwood lawyer will have to look for a deposit or a letter of credit . It is also possibl to get commit from Anbang owner , though the problem is that they are unknown and are also veri like abroad .The gold standard for deal with thi issu along these line is the Smithfield deal . In that acquisit , Smithfield Food wa bought by Shuanghui Intern Hold , a Chines compani with no asset in the Unit State .In that case , Smithfield onli remedi if the transact fail wa to collect a termin fee of up to $ 275 million , about 5 percent of the transact valu . Shuanghui fund thi termin fee by put it in escrow . Smithfield preserv the possibl of su Shuanghui if it will breach the agreement , but the parti knew that thi action would not go anywher .But in a hostil bid war a 5 percent deposit is weak brew . So thi deal may set a new standard for how target deal with the complet risk from Chines bidder . Perhap there will be a super escrow here of multipl billion . And it may be fund by letter of credit or financ letter instead of cash deposit .Starwood should fight hard on thi issu , though , becaus of the regulatori issu .The China risk on thi transact goe beyond the enforc of the agreement . Approv of Chines regul is requir for thi deal and there are sign that the govern may not approv , sinc the amount will exceed 15 percent of Anbang asset , the limit on insurers foreign invest under Chines rule .That the talk at least . The Chines regulatori process is a bit opaqu .But rememb what is drive thi deal ? Anbang is will to pay so much in order to arbitrag the Chines currenc , the renminbi . Anbang know that the renminbi might go down , and is desper to get it money out and convert it to dollar . Inde , Anbang appear partli built on a currenc play . Mani Chines citizen buy it high-yield life insur product becaus that allow for the convers of renminbi into dollar . Perhap the Chines govern may be more forgiv to Anbang , as thi convers may benefit the compani if there is inde further renminbi devalu .But who know ? And that creat regulatori risk No . 1 for Starwood .Then there is the issu of nation secur approv in the Unit State by the Committe on Foreign Invest in the Unit State , or Cfiu , a committe of variou feder agenc charg with review foreign takeov for nation secur purpos .A hotel acquisit doe not on it face rais nation secur issu . Cfiu , howev , doe review how close Starwood hotel are to nation secur facil . It ha previous block invest in a wind farm and a gold mine compani by Chines compani becaus these properti were locat too close to militari facil .Cfiu will almost certainli not block the Starwood deal , but it may requir divest of hotel , like Starwood properti near the White Hous . Thi analysi will take a while sinc Starwood ha about 1,300 properti . But thi will onli delay , not hold up , a deal .The final risk to thi transact is financ . Anbang will be look to borrow billion to financ the deal with it partner J. C. Flower & Compani and Primavera Capit . But financ can fall through , particularli in today market in the Unit State and China .And so , the question realli are whether Starwood will take the risk here , and how the lawyer deal with it . There are no complet solut  Starwood is unlik to be abl to get an agreement that it can enforc or collect the full acquisit price if Anbang walk away .Becaus of thi risk , Marriott bid is like to be a better one even if Anbang is will to pay more . Thi is becaus the bird in the hand of Marriott is a better bet .We learn thi lesson in the financi crisi . Then , the chemic maker Huntsman termin a deal with Basel to accept a higher offer from Hexion , but one with greater antitrust risk . The risk prove not to be worth it , as Hexion wa unabl to financ the deal and walk , pay Huntsman a fraction of what it lost .But if Starwood choos Anbang , how it deal with these issu will veri like be the templat for how American acquisit target deal with Chines issu go forward . After all , if Anbang can convert renminbi at inflat price to pay inflat valu for American properti , whi cant other Chines buyer ?Mani here in the Unit State are worri about a whole differ risk in thi transact . Which one will better honor those Starwood point : Marriott or Anbang ?', 'Sluggish global growth threaten to keep govern around the world from be abl to pay pension and bondhold , the chief economist of the Organ for Econom Cooper and Develop said on Wednesday .

They feed into a broader concern about whether the agenc can adequ polic the market by take on the biggest player .Jess Eising of ProPublica , who ha contribut to DealBook and ha delv deepli into the financi crisi , wrote the articl in The New Yorker about the S.E.C. decis not to pursu charg against ani senior execut at Goldman relat to a synthet collater debt oblig put togeth by the firm . Fabric Tourr , a midlevel trader who help structur the transact , wa the onli individu accus of wrongdo .A lawyer at the S.E.C . assign to the case provid materi show that the agenc seem to avoid pursu more senior execut for their role in the deal , at least not until the last moment . A supervisor at the agenc state in an email that mani involv in the transact were good peopl who had done one bad thing ,  and later wrote about the financi crisi that the vast major of the loss suffer had noth to do with fraud and the like and are more fairli attribut to lesser human fail of greed , arrog and stupid of which we are all guilti from time to time.When the time came to final decid who to sue , those involv in the investig were split about su anyon at Goldman abov Mr. Tourr . In the end , Robert S. Khuzami , the enforc director at the time , said that the lack of consensu among our group is itself , for me , confirmation that other should not be name .Goldman settl the case three month after be su by pay a $ 550 million penalti and admit that the market materi for the C.D.O . contain incomplet information. But the S.E.C . drop the most seriou fraud charg against the firm , resolv it under a provis that onli requir neglig rather than an intent to defraud . Mr. Tourr wa found liabl by a juri in 2013 .Stephen Gandel wrote in Fortun about a mortgage-back secur assembl and sold by Goldman that bundl more than 5,000 residenti subprim mortgag , eventu cost investor more than $ 500 million when mani of the shoddi mortgag went into default . Although the S.E.C . notifi the firm in Februari 2012 that it plan to pursu civil fraud charg , no further action wa taken . In an August 2012 file , Goldman disclos that the case had been drop , but no reason wa ever provid by the agenc for it decis .The Justic Depart later reach a $ 5 billion settlement with Goldman for it sale of residenti mortgage-back secur from 2005 to 2007 , includ the secur the S.E.C . investig in 2012 but decid not to act on .Accord to Mr. Gandel , the chairwoman of the S.E.C . at the time , Mari L. Schapiro , said that the case against Goldman never reach the five commission to review and decid whether to proceed with civil fraud charg . That mean the decis to drop the matter wa made by the staff in the enforc divis , even though there wa enough evid at one point to send a so-cal Well notic tell the firm that it plan to recommend charg .After the debacl in 2008 over the S.E.C. failur to do anyth about the huge Ponzi scheme perpetr by Bernard L. Madoff that result in investor lose billion of dollar , there wa a promis that the agenc would take a tougher approach . In mani way , the enforc divis pattern itself after the Justic Depart , with former prosecutor , like Mr. Khuzami , assum leadership posit .Mari Jo White , the current chairwoman of the S.E.C. , spoke in 2013 about adopt the broken windows approach use with great success by the polic in New York to send a messag to Wall Street that the agenc wa go to take a harder line on small violat . It follow the lead of feder prosecutor in offer lenienc to those who cooper , while announc that in some case it would requir an admiss of a violat rather than the usual approach of neither admit nor deni the charg .But The New Yorker and Fortun articl rais the question whether the S.E.C . wa will to take on the tough case against a well-fund oppon like Goldman , at least when the evid of wrongdo wa not overwhelm . The agenc continu to highlight it pursuit of insid trade case , but those have minim impact on the market compar with pursu wrongdo insid a larg organ .Prosecutor and administr agenc have the widest discret when decid not to accus someon of violat the law . That decis is almost alway made in secret , with no outsid review . It involv weigh the evid to determin not onli whether charg could be brought , but more import whether the case ha a reason chanc of success becaus mere file an accus can have a devast impact on the defend .Be in law enforc mean make tough call , and run the risk that a case will be lost . In the two case involv Goldman and it execut , there wa no right or wrong decis to be made becaus the evid of violat wa equivoc , so choos not to proceed is certainli defens .The broader issu to consid is the messag sent when the choic is made not to pursu a case , even though charg could have been file . Goldman publicli disclos that it had been notifi by the S.E.C . of possibl charg in 2012 relat to the mortgage-back secur it sold , and then the case quietli disappear . That doe not inspir public confid , especi when that deal , along with other , turn up four year later as part of a $ 5 billion settlement with the Justic Depart .The lesson for the financi industri may well be to fight the case , or at least not tri to settl it too quickli , when the evid of wrongdo is ambigu .For the public , the S.E.C. decis not to pursu charg feed the continu mistrust that the agenc will not take on difficult case if it can get a quick settlement instead , even one without an admiss of wrongdo . Whether that percept fair , it is certainli preval .The articl by Mr. Eising and Mr. Gandel show that these were close call , certainli not slam-dunk case . Without an explan about whi the agency staff revers it cours in one instanc and choos not to pursu individu in senior manag in the other , we are left to specul about the reason .The case have been put to rest and can not be revisit now . The S.E.C . doe not have to explain whi it choos to drop a case or pass on charg potenti defend , but then it can not object when the public draw it own infer from a failur to act .', 'More than 151 million American count themselv employ , a number that ha risen sharpli in the last few year . The question is thi : What are they do all day ?Becaus whatev it is , it bare seem to be regist in econom output . The number of hour American work rose 1.9 percent in the year end in March . New data releas Thursday show that gross domest product in the first quarter wa up 1.9 percent over the previou year . Despit constant advanc in softwar , equip and manag practic to tri to make corpor America more effici , actual econom output is mere move in lock step with the number of hour peopl put in , rather than rise as it ha throughout modern histori .We could chalk that up to a statist blip if it were a singl year ; product data are notori volatil . But thi ha been go on for some time . From 2011 through 2015 , the government offici labor product measur show onli 0.4 percent annual growth in output per hour of work . That the lowest for a five-year span sinc the 1977-to-1982 period , and far below the 2.3 percent averag sinc the 1950 .Product is one of the most import yet least understood area of econom . Over long period , it is the onli pathway toward higher level of prosper ; the reason an American worker make much more today than a centuri ago is that each hour of labor produc much more in good and servic . Put bluntli , if the kind of product growth impli by the new data publish Thursday were to persist indefinit , your grandchildren would be no richer than you .But it is also realli hard to measur , particularli for servic firm . ( How product were employe at Facebook , or your local bank , last quarter ? Have fun tri to figur it out . )And even with year of hindsight , economist are never quit sure whi product rise or fall . Dure the 2008 recess , labor product soar . Wa thi becaus employ laid off their least product worker first ? Becaus everybodi work harder , fear for their job ? Or wa it a measur problem as govern statistics-tak struggl to captur fast-mov chang in the economi ? We dont know for sure . ( Here one analysi that emphas the first explan . )That is a long way of say we dont know for sure what is go on right now , or how long it will last . But the possibl answer rang from utterli depress to downright optimist .The product slowdown is real , and it not go away . Earlier wave of innov in technolog ( a comput on everi offic worker desk , for exampl ) and manag strategi ( like outsourc noncor function ) have been fulli put into place across corpor America , and so are no longer increas product .Add to that a slowdown in capit spend by busi sinc the 2008 recess , which mean worker arent get better equip or softwar that might help them do their job more effici . Moreov , if you believ the theori mention abov about low-product worker be more like to lose their job dure the recess , the peopl return to the labor forc now may be less effect at boost econom output for each hour they put in .In the depress scenario , Americans standard of live are just go to grow more slowli in the futur , and there not much we can do about it . Fortun , thi isnt the onli possibl one .Mayb we just arent count thing right  or , to use the economists prefer term , there is measur error .After all , entir industri are be transform in way hard to account for in data on gross domest product , particularli in technolog and servic . Have a high-pow comput in our pocket and social network that let us stay in touch with friend may make us better off than the narrow math of gross domest product  which count onli what we pay for  would suggest .Still , it not clear whi these nonmarket gain in qualiti of life would be so differ now than they were in earlier gener when , for exampl , videocassett record becam widespread or the air becam cleaner thank to environment regul .The issu is not whether there bia ,  wrote the economist David M. Byrn , John G. Fernald and Marshal B. Reinsdorf in a paper on measur issu in product at the Brook Paper on Econom Activ thi spring . The question is whether it larger than it use to be.Their conclus , after examin tech and other measur issu , is that it isnt . That said , the tool that statistics-keep use to measur the economi are never perfect , so there could be problem not yet understood that are creat a fals impress of a product drought .Think about a busi that is invest for the futur . It hire a bunch of peopl and open new offic and build new factori . But while it is do all that stuff , it actual product is quit low . It ha a lot of peopl work a lot of hour , but veri low econom output until it oper are fulli up to speed .Mayb , just mayb , that is happen with the Unit State economi writ larg . Busi are ad worker in prepar for the futur , but it will take time for their invest to pay off in term of gross domest product .There a recent preced for that pattern . In the late 1990 , the stock market wa boom and compani were make huge invest in staff , equip and inform technolog . But report product growth wa actual below the long-term trend  onli about 1.7 percent a year from 1993 to 1998 , for exampl . Then it began soar in the year that follow , particularli in the earli 2000 .But here one piec of evid that the pattern of the 1990 is not what is afoot today : Busi invest spend on equip , intellectu properti and structur is low rel to the size of the economi . Youd expect those number to be higher if thi wa just a product lull as the economi wait for big invest in the futur to pay off .Still , there could be enough go on below the surfac of those overal number that the optimist case remain plausibl . To use one exampl , engin at sever compani are hard at work tri to perfect driverless car . At present , they are a sap on product  they put in mani thousand of hour of work with no econom output to show for it . But if success , their work could radic increas the nation product in the decad ahead .Appli the same across a wide rang of field  industri good , pharmaceut and medicin , financi technolog firm  and optim becom more plausibl . That the scenario we should all hope is occur : Slow product growth now is just a down payment on a much brighter futur .', 'The iPhon SE and the 9.7-inch iPad Pro were the two headline-grab devic that Appl unveil last week .

To edit or make new document , an Offic 365 subscript is need , start at $ 7 a month . Actual , I prefer Apple product suit of Number , Keynot and Page . The app are similar to Microsoft offer , though Number may not have as mani featur as Excel .Still , Apple interfac are more intuit than Microsoft , and the app are more relax to use .

But it is one of the company highest-prior project , accord to three peopl directli involv with the initi , who spoke on condit of anonym .Intern , Facebook Live is seen as a way to move beyond host convers about televis and live event to becom a venu for both .

I knew it wa someth I want The Huffington Post to do.But there is also some trepid insid media compani about get tie so close to yet anoth Facebook product . Some of those concern echo those rais last year , when media compani debat whether to particip in Facebook push to have news articl post directli on the social network .Most of the question , though , have focus on figur out how much money the compani will get for video stream view on the social network . Live stream revenu could come from advertis , subscript or paid one-tim event .Facebook , though , ha priorit get live video in front of as mani user as possibl . The compani ha been eager to talk with media compani about get start with stream , but remain vagu in convers about revenu share or subscript model .It is push a build-first , make-money-lat philosophi , one that can be frustrat to media partner , particularli those struggl to navig broader chang in the onlin media industri . But whatev the frustrat , they are outweigh by the prospect of reach Facebook huge audienc .It earli day , and as with all product at Facebook we build people-first , but we are commit to find a sustain monet model for partner share live video on Facebook ,  said Fidji Simo , a director of product at Facebook . It someth that wer think care about , and it import to us to creat someth that is a good experi for peopl on Facebook and that work for our partners.Media compani that spent much of last year produc origin video for their Facebook page have yet to see signific revenu , despit assur from the compani . But live onlin video ha larg vex media compani for two decad , and ani possibl path to success is hard to resist , especi one that requir few invest upfront .The whole thing ha been realli encourag ,  said Allison Rockey , the director of program for Vox.com . She ad , You need an iPhon and a mike , and you just kind of get started.One of the appeal for media compani ha been a sens of regain control of Facebook news feed , the primari sourc of inform on the social network , where post are sort base on an opaqu comput program . The lack of control ha made reach user  even those that follow media brand intent  more competit .With Live , though , live broadcast display higher in users feed  a priorit Facebook ha acknowledg publicli . The servic also notifi user through mobil app when friend and page they follow begin broadcast .So far , put video on the servic can be done onli by use a Facebook app on a mobil devic . But Facebook is consid let media partner broadcast live video use their own professional-grad studio record equip , accord to two of the peopl with knowledg of the company plan .

At the event , Microsoft said Window 10 , the latest version of it oper system , is now run on 270 million activ devic , eight month after it wa releas to the public . That repres the fastest adopt ever for a new version of Window , outpac the rate at which Window 7 wa adopt by 145 percent , the compani said .Microsoft also reveal new tool for develop to creat bot ,  piec of softwar that can be use to produc new method of interact with comput , such as a chat interfac for order pizza onlin .We want to build intellig that augment human abil and experi ,  Satya Nadella , Microsoft chief execut , said at the event .The bot move is someth of a gambl . Microsoft recent releas a Twitter chatbot call Tay that use artifici intellig to respond to commun from Twitter user . The experi went awri when peopl fool the softwar into repeat racist , sexist and other offens remark . Microsoft shut Tay down and Mr. Nadella acknowledg the compani had been humbl .Wer back to the draw board ,  he said .In anoth area of new technolog , Microsoft said it had begun ship a version of HoloLen , the company augment realiti headset that overlay digit imag on the wearer view of the real world . The $ 3,000 product is aim at develop make applic for HoloLen . Microsoft ha not said when it will begin sell a version of the product for the public or how much it will cost .The compani also emphas it progress with Window 10 , in a remind that  for all of the talk of Microsoft fade statur in the technolog industri  Window is still the softwar that most of the world use to run it PC .Microsoft previous said it intend to get Window 10 run on one billion devic two to three year after the product ship last Juli . In a recent interview , Terri Myerson , the execut vice presid of the Window and devic group at Microsoft , said he wa confid the compani could still reach that object .The goal wa alway ambiti , but enterpris are deploy faster than ever befor ,  Mr. Myerson said .Yet Window 10 may not do everyth Microsoft hope . It success ha not significantli shift the tech industry dynam , in which mobil platform like Apple iO and Google Android have eclips Window among softwar develop hunt for the largest and most engag audienc of user . PC sale have not grown in year , and most analyst dont expect that to chang soon .Jan Dawson , an analyst at Jackdaw Research , said develop had littl incent to creat softwar for Window first when they can reach bigger audienc elsewher .Thi year , well like see more enterpris embrac Window 10 after a period of watch and test the platform , so that will help , but it wont do anyth for consum adopt or increas develop by consumer-centr app develop ,  he said in an email .A big reason for Microsoft wane influenc among develop is it dire situat in mobil . The company acquisit of Nokia mobil phone divis sever year ago wa wide view as a disast . Microsoft later laid off much of the work forc that join through the deal and slash the number of handset model it sell .Window 10 is suppos to give develop an extra incent to creat app for Microsoft product by make it easi for them to produc softwar that can run on ani Window 10 devic , includ PC , smartphon and the Xbox One consol . Microsoft prais new univers apps of thi natur from the like of Twitter , Uber , King , Disney , the Wargam Group , Squar Enix and Yahoo .It isnt clear that the app be made for Window 10 will be suffici to get peopl to buy phone run the softwar .We obvious have work to do in mobil ,  Mr. Myerson said .To keep interest in Window 10 , Microsoft said Wednesday that it would refresh the softwar with an updat that would connect user with Cortana , the virtual assist in the oper system , without requir a PC to be unlock first . Peopl could then use their PC like Amazon Echo devic , which can be summon to answer question about the weather and trivia from across the room .The Window 10 updat will also enhanc a featur call Window Hello that let peopl more secur log into Window use biometr verif , like facial recognit . The chang will allow peopl to sign into websit and app with Window Hello so they dont have to use password .David Smith , an analyst at Gartner , said Window 10 should be consid a success , especi compar with it predecessor , Window 8 , which mani peopl dislik for too aggress push a strike redesign of the software interfac .

If devic manufactur want to preinstal the Googl Play app , they must agre to instal Googl search and it Chrome browser as well  and make Googl the default search engin .With some manufactur , Googl pay to have it search function preinstal as the default option  an estim $ 1 billion a year to Appl , accord to a court file last year .If these claim seem a littl like dj vu , that becaus anyon over the age of 20 ha seen thi befor : Microsoft embed it Internet Explor browser in it Window desktop oper system , a so-cal tie arrang . In the late 1990 , the Justic Depart and European Union regul accus Microsoft of illeg tri to extend it domin posit in oper system to Internet browser and search . ( Microsoft ultim settl the case . )But the rapid rise of mobil and tablet devic ha pretti much render all that irrelev . The latest version of Internet Explor still ha the largest market share for desktop Internet browser , but it ha onli a neglig share for fast-grow mobil and tablet devic , where Googl Chrome is far ahead .Technolog chang ha also undermin the superfici similar between the old Microsoft case and the new Android one . Back then , consum who want a rival browser like Netscap to run on their Window oper system rather than the ( free ) Explor had to go to a store , pay for a disk with a rival program and then instal it .Today , a free rival browser is a tap away . When I check into Googl Play thi week , there were more browser choic than I knew what to do with , includ some Id never heard of ( Maxthon ? ) . But Im satisfi with Google offer and have no interest in further clutter my phone display screen .It so easi to substitut or add app that it not even clear Google agreement with manufactur would be deem tie arrang . I dont think they meet the requir ,  said Herbert Hovenkamp , an antitrust expert at the Univers of Iowa Colleg of Law . There almost no limit to your abil to add addit app or to delet the Googl app and substitut a differ one.Of cours , there obvious an advantag to be the default app , or els Googl wouldnt be pay Appl such a larg sum . On the other hand , anyon can chang if theyr unhappi ,  Professor Hovenkamp said .Nor do manufactur have to preinstal ani Googl app on devic use Android , which is an open sourc system , avail free . Amazon Fire wa an Android mobil devic with a built-in Amazon shop app , but it didnt come with Googl Play or Search preinstal . Fire wa deem a flop , in part becaus it lack popular Googl app like Gmail and Map .Even if Googl is found to be use a tie arrang , that not necessarili illeg or bad for consum . Scott Hemphil , an antitrust professor at New York Univers School of Law , said tie arrang are common across a wide array of product and industri . No one complain becaus they dont have a choic of transmiss manufactur in their car ,  Professor Hemphil said .These same issu were rais last year in a class-act suit in a Feder District Court in California .The two name plaintiff both bought Android phone , one in Louisvil , Ky. , the other in De Moin , Iowa , and complain that they hadnt realiz they came with Googl search alreadi instal . Judg Beth Labson Freeman of Feder District Court struggl to find ani evid that either had suffer ani harm .She found that Google conduct had no impact on the price of the phone , sinc both Android and the rival app are free . And their broad accus that Google behavior threaten harm to innov and consum choice  almost the same word adopt by the European Union  wa entir too conclusori and specul ,  she rule . There wa no evid Google behavior prevent consum from freeli choos among search product or prevent competitor from innovating. She dismiss the suit .So who exactli is be hurt by Google behavior ? It not , appar , consum , in whose name thi battl is be fought . Google search engin is even more popular in Europ , where it ha a more than 90 percent market share , accord to the European Union , than it is in the Unit State .The drive forc push the European action wa a consortium of Google corpor rival  foremost among them , iron , Microsoft , which onc complain loudli about European overreach . It ha back a lobbi group call FairSearch , which hail the European action against Googl as a crucial step to end abus busi practices.( Microsoft and Googl said thi week that they were buri the hatchet and would withdraw regulatori complaint about each other around the globe . Microsoft ha said it will no longer back FairSearch . )If Microsoft realli want to compet with Google search engin in Europ , it ha the wherewith to outbid Googl and pay manufactur to make Bing their default search engin .The Russian Internet compani Yandex ha been the most vocal in urg European action against Appl , which is even more iron consid that Russia is not a member of the European Union and ha been sanction over it annex of Crimea . Yandex ha domin Internet search in Russia but ha recent been lose ground there to Googl . It file  and , no surpris , won  similar claim in Russia . ( Googl is appeal that outcom . )Even if competitor like Yandex would stand to benefit , the purpos of antitrust law , at least in the U.S. , is to protect consum , not competitor ,  Professor Hemphil said .Professor Hovenkamp echo that thought . Europ is move pretti far into left field with thi case ,  he said . It seem like over-regul for the benefit of competitor that wont end up do consum ani good.', 'William Hewlett , the Silicon Valley pioneer who wa a co-found of Hewlett-Packard , onc said , You can not manag what you can not measure.

As wev watch that number grow , it ha somehow felt that despit billion of dollar of research and intervent , there littl we can do .That feel shift last week when Sylvia Mathew Burwel , the secretari of health and human servic , announc that Medicar wa plan to pay for lifestyl intervent focus on diet and physic activ to prevent Type 2 diabet . It an exampl of small-scal research effort into health servic that have work and that have expand to reach more peopl .Articl appear everi day on major breakthrough ,  which later never pan out , while thi one , full of success , rare made the news . Thi is the curs of health servic research , which seek to improv popul health through improv in access or deliveri of care . When most peopl think of diabet research , theyr think about a cure or a new medic . Those grand slam are excit , but they rare happen . Nevertheless , peopl want to see them . Donor want to support them . Organ hire peopl to go after them .Health servic research is more about hit singl , day after day . There no billion dollar payoff , no fame , no Nobel Prize . But it get the job done , and it often more like to chang the health of most American .Thi announc is base on work at an Indianapoli Y.M.C.A . by a social ecologist name David Marrero , who work with me at the Indiana Univers School of Medicin . The other collabor , a physician name Ron Ackermann , onc share a cubicl with me when we were both fellow , and also did much of thi work at Indiana Univers .The Diabet Prevent Program grew out of extens research on weight manag and behavior learn . More than 3,200 patient age 25 to 75 with pre-diabet were random to one of three group . The first group wa given an intens lifestyl intervent . By focus on a low-fat , low-calori diet with the addit of exercis through brisk walk or a similar intens activ , it encourag peopl to lose at least 7 percent of their bodi weight and maintain that over the cours of the trial .The backbon of the intervent involv 16 one-hour face-to-fac meet that help each individu particip set and achiev goal to improv health habit . The second group wa treat with metformin , a medic that can lower blood glucos , and the third wa the control group , provid with a placebo medic .The trial wa end earli becaus the result were so compel . Those in the medic arm had a 31 percent reduct in the risk of develop diabet . More import , those in the lifestyl intervent saw a 58 percent reduct in their risk . Moreov , if you were 60 or older at the begin of the studi , your reduct wa 71 percent . A later meta-analysi confirm that these result for lifestyl intervent were replic across numer differ studi .Unfortun , thi wa a perfect exampl of where efficaci did not necessarili translat into effect . Identifi patient with pre-diabet wa sometim difficult . Physician werent reimburs for do it , so mani didnt test for it . As those barrier were overcom , a larger one remain : There wa no real-world , widespread mechan to start the intens intervent the prevent program requir . At $ 1,476 a patient , it wa just too expens and impract to run in physician offic .It wa at thi point that Dr. Ackermann and Mr. Marrero thought of contact the Y.M.C.A. , or the Y , as it is now known . As a larg , nationwid commun organ , they figur , the Y might just be abl to bring the lifestyl intervent to scale . There are more than 2,700 Ys in the Unit State , and more than 46 million peopl live within three mile of one of them . They engag the Y of Greater Indianapoli in 2003 just as the organ wa look for innov strategi to expand beyond the Y reput as a gym and swim place primarili for health seeker .As the behavior expert , Mr. Marrero work with the Y to reshap all 16 core intervent lesson and sever mainten lesson into a group-bas format led by instructor who were Y employe . The new intervent wa about $ 205 per person , a fraction of the origin cost .In 2004 , Dr. Ackermann ( with Mr. Marrero as hi key collabor ) receiv fund from the Nation Institut of Health for the Deploy Studi , which wa design to test thi new Y Model for deliveri of the intervent . Those in the intervent group had a 6 percent decreas in weight , compar with 2 percent in the control group . Their cholesterol also drop 22 mg/dL , while cholesterol level in the control group rose 6 mg/dL . More import , these differ were sustain after 28 month .The studi show that the Y might be a promis channel for wide-scal dissemin of the intervent program . Further studi found that primari care clinic could put in pre-diabet screen use easy-to-perform hemoglobin A1c test in the offic . Patient who were found to be at high risk were refer to a Y coordin , who offer them the opportun to take part in the Y program at no charg .Over the 29 month of the next studi , about 18,000 primari care patient were screen for diabet , and about 29 percent of them were determin to be at high risk . More than 500 of them particip in the program . Those who were offer it achiev about five pound more in weight loss over a year . Those who attend at least half the class achiev almost 12 more pound of weight loss than those who were manag in the clinic onli .Despit these strong research studi , the Y program still remain hidden to most American . In 2009 , Dr. Ackermann and Mr. Marrero present their research , as well as the research of other investig , at a nation meet with the Center for Diseas Control and Nation Institut of Health . The meet , attend by a host of govern health organ and sever privat health system purchas and payer , catalyz a new partnership between the Y and UnitedHealth Group , a major health insur compani . The C.D.C . and other later join in thi effort , which involv scale the Y program to over 43 state and the District of Columbia .Their research wa behind the Diabet Prevent Act of 2009 . Thi act , later pass as a compon of the Afford Care Act , appropri money to the C.D.C . for the Nation Diabet Prevent Program , which provid train and recognit for organ like the Y that seek third-parti payment for the program .In 2012 , the Center for Medicar and Medicaid Innov grant the Y about $ 12 million to start a pilot program to evalu whether Medicar payment for it program might be cost-effect . Among sever other sourc of data , the actuari at the Center for Medicar and Medicaid Servic use find from Dr. Ackermann studi of UnitedHealthcar client that were offer the Y program to discov that the intervent offer cost save . They estim that if the Y program were expand to all Medicar beneficiari , the govern might save about $ 2,650 per particip over 15 month , much more than the program cost .I spend too much time here at The Upshot complain that our health polici fail to be base on research , or that thing we do dont work . It nice onc in a while to have the opposit be true .', 'One day not long ago , an Uber driver pick up a passeng in San Francisco gritti Tenderloin district . Let call our passeng Abbi , becaus her real name ha been lost to databas anonym , an effort to keep her ident privat .Abbi need to go to Noe Valley , a 25-minut drive that might ordinarili have cost about $ 15 . But she had chosen UberPool , the ride-hail company 18-month-old car-pool program . In the process she had unwittingli initi one of the service more epic recent trip .Unlik a standard Uber ride , in which a singl rider start a one-tim trip , UberPool work like a parti line for car . Travi Kalanick , Uber co-found and chief execut , describ it as the futur of hi compani  and thu the futur of transport in America .Call up the app , specifi your destin , and in exchang for a signific discount , UberPool match you with other rider go the same way . The servic might creat a ride just for you , but just as often , it put you in a ride that began long ago  one that ha span sever drop-off and pickup , a kind of instant bu line creat from collect urban demand .The trip Abbi start would last nearli an hour and meander over 10 mile across San Francisco , stop nine time to pick up and drop off passeng . After Abbi got in , the driver collect hi second passeng  let call him Ben  a few block away . Ben got out after about a mile . A coupl of block later , Carri got in . By thi time Abbi might have been get annoy ; fortun , about six minut later , the car reach Noe Valley . Abbi got out , but Carri wa still in the car , so the trip went on . Danni got in after about a mile , then Carri got out , then Edward got in , then Danni got out . Final , after about 55 minut of drive , the car reach Edward destin , and the trip wa done .In total , Uber collect about $ 48 for the ride , of which the driver kept $ 35 . The compani had collaps five separ ride into a singl trip , save about six mile of travel and remov sever car from the road . For rider , the discount amount to save of at least half of a standard Uber trip . For the driver , an hourlong trip with no idl time result in steadi earn ( Uber driver make money onli when rider are in the car ) . And though Uber made less from the singl ride than it would have from multipl ride , the compani benefit by instal itself as a fixtur in people live .When ride get cheaper , it mean that for more peopl in more citi , Uber is cheaper than own a car ,  Mr. Kalanick said in a recent interview . And when Uber is cheaper than own a car , we can becom a mainstay of transport in that city.Here anoth way to put it : UberPool may push us to re-evalu how we think about Uber and it impact on the world .The car servic ha long been polar . Though Uber is belov by mani rider , the way it ha muscl into citi and the public conscious , and the manner in which it ha alter labor relat and urban plan , have rattl lawmak , activist and even it driver .UberPool rais the stake . Becaus it reduc price and increas volum , it suggest that if Uber ultim succe , the compani could have a much bigger impact on urban mobil , labor , the environ , local economi and the nation transport infrastructur than wev all suppos  and it effect could confound the expect of it harshest critic .Like most initi at Uber , Pool began as an experi . Now 100 million pool trip have been taken sinc the program began , and ten of million more are occur each month . The compani onc spur demand for Pool with heavi discount , but the servic ha grown beyond that  today , in mani of the 29 citi where it oper , UberPool is profit , Mr. Kalanick said .We had to lose million of dollar in individu citi to make it work ,  he said . But at thi point it no longer a bet in term of financi invest  the onli question is how much more effici we can make it.In mani citi , UberPool now account for more than half of Uber trip taken . In Lo Angel , New York , Chicago and San Francisco , more than 100,000 peopl take UberPool everi week . In China , Uber is run 20 million UberPool trip a month .A repres for Lyft , Uber primari American competitor , said it car-pool servic , Lyft Line , ha also becom a sustain busi . About 30 percent of Lyft ride are now pool . In San Francisco and New York , Lyft biggest citi , the proport is now more than half . On Tuesday , Lyft introduc a separ car pool servic call Lyft Carpool , aim at daili commut .Mr. Kalanick said it wa like that soon , in big citi and even in mani suburb , most Uber ride will be pool , mean each Uber car will be serv more than one rider most of the time .If that occur , and if Uber continu grow at it breakneck pace , it would repres a moment transform in how American get around . Car-pool wa popular in the earliest day of the automobil , but for much of the last 100 year , the number have been go in the opposit direct . Today most American drive to work alon .Transport scholar are now look into whether car-pool by ride compani could revers these dismal number . Susan Shaheen , co-director of the Transport Sustain Research Center at the Univers of California , Berkeley , ha begun a studi with the Natur Resourc Defens Council to determin the environment impact of Uber and Lyft car-pool system .Ms. Shaheen said her studi , the result of which are due thi year , will seek to answer sever question : How mani car are pool servic get off the road ? Are peopl use UberPool and Lyft Line instead of public transport , or are peopl supplement public transit instead  for instanc , use car when buse and train arent run ? Do cheap Uber ride push peopl to consid abandon their own car ? Or if Uber ride are so cheap , are peopl now more like to travel when otherwis they might have stay home ?While that studi is in progress , the earli data suggest that by get more butt in seats  a phrase that ha becom a mantra at Uber San Francisco headquart  car-pool servic may alreadi be reduc traffic , ga use and automobil emiss .Uber ha calcul the environment impact of UberPool ride . In the first three month of 2016 , the servic ha elimin 21 million automobil mile ; that about 400,000 gallon of ga and 3,800 metric ton of carbon dioxid emiss , it say . The compani say that by reduc price , the program ha also expand access to Uber .Critic of Uber rise have long fear that cheaper ride could undercut support for public transport , but a new studi by the American Public Transport Associ , a trade group of transit organ , found the opposit .The more like someon is to use Uber and Lyft , the more like they are to take public transport , and for our industri that is veri hearten ,  said Darnel Grisbi , the group director of polici develop and research . Peopl who use these servic tend to own fewer car , Mr. Grisbi said . As a result , they becom more interest in all form of transport  train , buse , taxi , bike  and see Uber and Lyft as a complement to other transit , not a replac for it .Uber data bear thi out . In Lo Angel , 14 percent of UberPool trip start or end near a Metro station . In San Francisco dure the morn commut , 10 percent of UberPool trip are to or from the Bay Area Rapid Transit train .Uber and Lyft are expand their car-pool oper and their partnership with transit system . In Seattl , Toronto and Manila , Uber is test high-occup sport util vehicl that run along fix rout dure commut hour . In Chicago , Uber ha an option for commut to pick up casual car-pool , and Lyft is start a similar program in San Francisco thi week .Mr. Kalanick said these experi would continu , becaus reduc traffic wa part of Uber mission .I grew up in L.A. , and I spent almost 30 year of my life there , and I spent year of my life stuck behind the wheel , think about how to make thi better ,  he said . So there go to be a big smile on my face if Uber can have ani impact on reduc traffic on freeway . It would feel like a big deal.', 'Dure trip to war-torn countri like Afghanistan , Jane Mosbach Morri discov , to her alarm , that women had littl control over their financ . Some were forbidden to work or even touch money . The antidot , she decid , wa start an onlin market stock with artisan work made by survivor of war , genocid , human traffick and other abus . The site To the Market would put much-need money into their hand .Each handmad piec on the site ha a power back stori , such as the deka necklac , which is made of recycl paper by femal survivor of war in Northern Uganda .Peopl want to know where someth is made ,  said Ms. Morri . A piec may be spun in a leper coloni or craft in an AID shelter.But in cyberspac , good cant be touch . So Ms. Morri , who wa a counterterror advis for the State Depart , turn to pop-up store as a way to sell the jewelri , handbag and other item that carri these power stori .She began pitch her pop-up store at confer , such as one for refuge put on by the Red Cross . Other are held in yoga studio or women home . These place are usual free , and she can walk away with ten of thousand of dollar of sale , put more money into the hand of survivor .Entrepreneur like Ms. Morri are help revit pop-up store , a decades-old retail concept . More parti than hard sell , thi new breed of pop-up is becom increasingli innov and fun  far more than the season pop-up that onc prevail . And they are also increasingli profit , expert say , sinc consum crave these new experi .Use pop-up doe , of cours , still help entrepreneur stay nimbl and lean . They do not need to sign long leas , stash away much cash or carri big credit line . For their part , consum can meet the design and touch and feel their work , which can not be done onlin . In the process , brand can be built more quickli , sale can be increas and new product can be test .Pop-up store are a tremend format ,  said Burt Flicking III , manag director at the Strateg Resourc Group . They are exponenti way to build a brand.These store , and e-commerc , are put big dent in older retail chain , Mr. Flicking said . They are go through a retail ice age ,  he said , as once-reli retail anchor like JC Penney and Sport Author sputter . They are weigh down by high cost and long product schedul , he ad .Consum are look for new way to shop and new brand ,  he ad . They want better qualiti at better price . Legaci store , though , have a harder time chang their mixes.In a Darwinian sale environ , pop-up store are win .The hip eyewar maker Warbi Parker help push pop-up store into a year-round , fun event . The compani turn a school bu into a travel eyewear shop , trick it out with leather couch , wood panel and even vintag book , and then took it on the road trip across the countri .The bu wa visual and out of the box ,  said Melissa Gonzalez , author of the book The Pop-Up Paradigm : How Brand Build Human Connect in a Digit Age ( Lionesqu Media , 2014 ) . And it show that you dont need a store.Pop-up entrepreneur are continu to innov . Event are , well , pop up in garag , around pool and even in lock storag space . Some retail are even do 3-D pop-up print jewelri , say expert . And one artist open a galleri in a giant Christma tree .Theyr risk taker ,  said Jeremi Bara , chief execut of PopUp Republ . Pop-up store are temporari so you can be more creative. The event , he warn , should blend in your product or servic , though , rather than be a distract .Catherin Nicol , who ha an onlin jewelri boutiqu of the same name , ha even ditch trade show for pop-up . She tri to hold two pop-up sale a month , where she sell her jewelri , which is made of semipreci gemston that were inspir by travel to Spain and Africa . Thi strategi , she add , is in keep with her busi model of stay lean and agil .It more lucr to stay out of the game and approach it in an artisan style ,  said Ms. Nicol , who studi apparel design at Parson School of Design . It lead to sticki customers.For one pop-up , she set up shop in the lobbi of the softwar develop Cere Logic , which mani peopl pass through . And for Valentine Day , she sold her jewelri dure men happi hour at a bar in Austin , which did not cost her anyth , either . She also work with flower vendor , chocol seller and a massag therapist for that event .I cant compet with Forev 21 price or David Yurman notorieti ,  she said . But I can show my custom that I valu them . They dont want to walk into a store and be treat like nobodies.Like Ms. Nicol , other entrepreneur are also forg partnership with food maker and other artisan . And these event may be held at hotel , mall or other high-traff local . Success pop-up should ignit the five sens , Ms. Gonzalez explain , becaus they are sell lifestyl event .Sense-bolst is exactli what Paul Tribl , a co-found of the luxuri men wear compani Ledburi , aim for with pop-up . To build popular , he ha been throw partylik event , which have includ bourbon tast , local breweri and DJ who spin funk and soul music .One pop-up parti in Atlanta drew a crowd of more than 350 . And Steven Yeun , a star of The Walk Dead ,  even brought Scott Gimpl , a note televis show and comedi writer , who bought a blazer .Wer all about fit and qualiti , and that our mantra ,  said Mr. Tribl , who studi shirt make with a London master tailor after hi dream of go into financ evapor dure the financi crisi . And that veri tactil . You have to feel it . So these pop-up are great introduct for customers.For Mr. Tribl , pop-up fuel sale . And typic , hi best e-commerc custom spend the most money . He also use pop-up to test retail locat , such as the Georgetown area of Washington , where one pop-up store last for three month . The team look at foot traffic , repeat buy and other variabl . Wer open a perman store in the same neighborhood ,  he saidMr. Tribl ad that organ a pop-up event in one week can be stress . You need a staff that a SWAT team to execut ,  he said .Lack of plan , though , can doom the event . Retail may not fulli evalu a locat , said Ms. Gonzalez , or invest enough time in tell a stori . Understand the goal of a pop-up ,  she advis .Dure the earli day of the Thursday Boot Compani , pop-up were held at a co-founder apart in the Flatiron section of Manhattan . We did fit ,  said Connor Wilson , Thursday Boot other co-found . Gave out free beer . And it wa a chanc to connect with customers.Anoth free pop-up wa held at The Garret , a woodsi bar in Manhattan West Villag , on a Saturday afternoon .

One three-month pop-up event wa held at a retail space , which wa part of Union Market in Washington It handcraft boot were display on industri cabl spool and the special design Thursday Boot flag wa fli . Wer tri to keep it fresh and fun ,  said Mr. Wilson .Shop in person for handcraft item is a nice chang from buy onlin , said Ms. Morri .

They will also have the abil to elimin ad and save song to their phone to listen to them offlin . The servic will have more than 125 million song , the compani said .One exampl of how the new two-tier system will work is Adel , whose music is releas through Soni in the Unit State . Free user will be abl to hear a few of her singl as well as 30-second sampl of the rest of her catalog ; subscrib can listen to all of her song .The new servic , introduc on Tuesday , will at first be avail onli in the Unit State , but it will be expand around the world thi year , accord to the compani .The chang is a signific departur for SoundCloud and give it an unusu place in the alreadi crowd market of onlin music servic .

It ha attract 175 million regular user , accord to the compani .But the site drew the ire of the major record label becaus none of it materi wa licens and therefor paid no royalti . SoundCloud , which is base in Berlin , wa also face grow loss by provid a free servic , with host fee and a small amount of advertis as it onli sourc of revenu . In 2014 , the last year for which it ha report it account , the compani had $ 19.5 million in revenu but it had a net loss of almost $ 44 million .Sinc 2014 , SoundCloud ha sign licens deal with the major record compani , as well as independ , which give the compani access to those labels catalog and allow it to sell subscript .The music industri is keen to promot paid-stream servic , which pay much more in royalti than free version . Stream gener about 34 percent of the record industry revenu in the Unit State , more than ani other sourc . Accord to the Record Industri Associ of America , about 13 million peopl in the Unit State were pay for music subscript by the end of last year .SoundCloud size may be at an advantag as it seek new subscrib .

With a headset , camera and game control , the system , which cost $ 1,500 when bundl with a power comput , is the first virtual realiti product of it kind to reach consum , befor similar one come thi year from HTC and Soni .Peopl who tri it say it differ from anyth theyv ever experienc in their live ,  Mr. Zuckerberg wrote in a Facebook post when he announc the Oculu acquisit . But thi is just the start . Imagin enjoy a courtsid seat at a game , studi in a classroom of student and teacher all over the world or consult with a doctor face-to-fac  just by put on goggl in your home.Over the last week , I test the Rift and mani piec of content for the system to see how true Mr. Zuckerberg word might ring . I can report that while the Rift is a well-built hardwar system brim with potenti , the first wave of app and game avail for it narrow the device like user to hard-cor gamer . It is also rougher to set up and get accustom to than product like smartphon and tablet .Here a tour through my earli experi of the Rift :The Rift work with technolog that some might find anachronist : a Window PC , monitor , keyboard and mous . With mani peopl shift away from desktop comput toward laptop , tablet and smartphon , find a place to instal the Rift and those other compon may be a challeng . In my modest San Francisco apart , I set up the system in the live room next to my televis set . What an eyesor .On first use , the Rift felt sturdi and well made . The adjust strap made it easi to fit around my head , and the built-in headphon creat deep , high-qual sound . My main issu , which I suspect had to do with my face shape , wa that I could not adjust the headgear to block out a small space right beneath my nose  I resort to tape a piec of paper over it .Emil Rodriguez , an Oculu spokesman , said the headset is design to take weight off the nose , which is whi some peopl see a tini space at the bottom of the headset .Get start with the devic took about an hour . Oculu instruct you to run an app that walk you through the process , which includ plug in the headset and camera , synchron an Xbox control and strap on the headset .The biggest holdup wa find and download content through the Oculu app store . Mani game are larg download of more than 6 gigabyt , so a game took up to half an hour to download .After the install button wa click to enabl Window to finish instal a game , there wa anoth hangup : I couldnt run a game and download anoth one simultan . Instead , I had to quit whatev I wa do in the Rift to download someth new . That mean it will take mani hour to start a nice collect of Rift game .Gamer who play on PC , PlayStat or Xbox are familiar with these more demand setup . But those use to unwrap , say , a smartphon , and get start after a few tap may find the Rift setup labori .Mr. Rodriguez said onli some app need to be instal use the comput mous ; most should be abl to be instal directli through the headset . He said download were paus while app were run on the Rift to avoid compromis perform .I stood alon in an empti room besid a feroci dinosaur . A few second later , I wa crowd around a campfir with a fox , a deer and a rabbit . Then I wa perch atop a skyscrap , look down .These are some of the environ that Oculu place you in in a simul it call Dreamdeck , which serv as an introduct to virtual realiti . As in an incoher dream you might have after consum a batch of special browni , you jump from one disconnect scene to anoth .The Dreamdeck app is symbol of the state of content for the Rift . The first batch of app and game ad up to a confus , disjoint virtual realiti landscap . In my test , my reaction wa more often Whi would I want to be here ?  or Whi is thi in virtual realiti ?  rather than Wow.One exampl wa the Rift most promin game , EVE : Valkyri , in which you take on the role of a spaceship pilot kill in battl . Sinc your conscious wa captur when you die , it get inject into a new bodi for everi fight . The game , which involv steer a spaceship and shoot gun and missil at other onlin player , wa impress and stimul , and die wa appropri stress .But a realiti in which you are a dead pilot enslav to fight and die over and over ? Hard-cor gamer may love thi , but I prefer to be in a less depress place when escap from actual realiti . Put me on a beach where I can look at whale .Anoth game , Adventur Time , base on the children cartoon of the same name , took place in a more lightheart atmospher . It involv move the protagonist , Finn , through a three-dimension space , with the goal of jump around through multipl level in pursuit of a bad guy , Magic Man , to break a curs . The game wa cute and fun , but it could easili have been play on a televis set . The virtual realiti headgear didnt provid clear benefit .A better use of the virtual realiti headgear wa Farland , a game that involv visit foreign planet to gather inform about alien creatur and plant by take photo of them . Step toward the Oculu camera move me closer to an alien so I could tighten the frame of the photo . Look at a place and press a button on the game control teleport me to that locat .If you purchas the Rift , you had better have thick skin . The aesthet of the headgear  it look like a pair of black ski goggl with air traffic control headphon built into the side  is not design to get you a date . And sinc wear the Rift make user less awar of the outsid world , video and photo of them don the contrapt  and taken without their knowledg  may end up on Instagram or Facebook . I becam a subject of ridicul when my partner wa watch TV and I crouch in the middl of the live room while play the dead space pilot game .The Rift ha other consequ for the mind and bodi . I felt mental drain after 20-minut session . My eye felt strain after half an hour , and over a week I develop a nervou eye twitch .Oculu recommend Rift owner eas into the headset : Use it a few minut at a time initi , then gradual increas the amount of time . All Rift user should take short break after everi 30 minut of use , the compani said .The headset may also leav last impress , or what I call nerd paint ,  on your face . After a long session , the Rift left two set of parallel horizont line under my eye .The Rift graphic , sound and head track , which is the device abil to follow where the viewer look , do feel like someth out of scienc fiction . While the system setup is somewhat complex , the smooth of the graphic and the high-qual design of the headgear make virtual realiti feel readi for prime time .And yet there may be a higher reward for those who wait to buy the Rift .For one , Oculu ha delay the releas of it motion-bas control , call Touch , until later thi year . In my experi , the motion control felt much more natur to use in virtual realiti applic than a game control .It would also be wise to see what game becom avail when PlayStat VR , Sony virtual realiti headset that connect to a PlayStat , arriv in Octob . Analyst say PlayStat VR ha an edg partli becaus of it lower cost  about $ 800 when combin with accessori and a PlayStat 4 , or nearli half the price of a full Rift system .When it come down to it , I dont disagre with Mr. Zuckerberg that thi is just the begin of virtual realiti . With about 30 game and a few app avail at Rift introduct , there isnt much to do with the system yet . Oculu will eventu need a larger , more divers set of content to transcend it initi audienc of gamer geek .I , for one , will be wait .', 'HONG KONG  China govern said on Monday that it would take step to more strictli manag websit in the countri , it latest push to set boundari in the wider Internet .A draft law post by one of China technolog regul said that websit in the countri would have to regist domain name with local servic provid and with the author .It wa not clear whether the rule would appli to all websit or onli to those host on server in China . Chines law can be haphazardli enforc and are usual vagu , and becaus the new rule is onli a draft , analyst said they expect the regul , the Chines Ministri of Industri and Inform Technolog , to specifi later to whom the law would appli .If the rule appli to all websit , it will have major implic and will effect cut China out of the global Internet .

It can be that they expand in the future.

The discount increas if Spotifi wait longer than a year to do so , they said . The coupon payment on the debt would also continu to rise over time , the peopl said .The deal is similar to the one that Goldman Sach arrang for Uber in Januari 2015 . The ride-hail compani rais $ 1.6 billion in convert debt .

Feder offici have refus to identifi the person , or organ , who help crack the devic , and have declin to specifi the procedur use to open the iPhon .

A manag who had been respons for handl most of the government data extract request left the team to work in a differ part of the compani , accord to four current and former Appl employe , who spoke on the condit of anonym becaus they were not author to speak publicli about the chang . Other employe , among them one whose task includ tri to hack Apple own product , left the compani over the last few month , they said , while new peopl have join .The situat is in mani way a continu of the cat-and-mous game Appl is constantli engag in with hacker , but the unusu promin natur of thi hack  and the fact that the hacker wa the Unit State govern  creat a predica for the compani .Appl is a busi , and it ha to earn the trust of it custom ,  said Jay Kaplan , chief execut of the tech secur compani Synack and a former Nation Secur Agenc analyst . It need to be perceiv as have someth that can fix thi vulner as soon as possible.Appl refer to a statement it made on Monday when the govern file to drop it case demand that the compani help it open Mr. Farook iPhon . We will continu to increas the secur of our product as the threat and attack on our data becom more frequent and more sophist ,  Appl said .Appl ha been make mani long-term move to increas the secur of it devic . The company chief execut , Timothi D. Cook , ha told colleagu that he stand by Apple road map to encrypt everyth store on it devic and servic , as well as inform store in Apple cloud servic iCloud , which custom use to back up the data on their mobil devic . Appl engin have also begun develop new secur measur that would make it tougher for the govern to open a lock iPhon .For now , with the dearth of inform about the flaw in Mr. Farook iPhon 5C , which run Apple iO 9 oper system , secur expert could onli guess at how the govern broke into the smartphon .Forens expert said the govern might have attack Apple system use a wide discuss method to extract inform from a protect area in the phone by remov a chip and fool a mechan that block password guess , in order to find the user password and unlock the data .The author may have use a procedur that mirror the phone storag chip , call a NAND chip , and then copi it onto anoth chip . Often refer to as NAND-mirror ,  thi would allow the F.B.I . to replac the origin NAND chip with one that ha a copi of that content . If the F.B.I . tri 10 passcod to unlock the phone and fail , it could then gener a new copi of the phone content and tri anoth password guess .It like tri to play the same level on Super Mario Brother over and over again and just restor from your save game everi time you kill Mario ,  said Jonathan Zdziarski , an iO forens expert .Newer iPhon model may be less suscept to NAND-mirror becaus they have an upgrad chip known as the A7 , with a secur processor call the Secur Enclav that ha a uniqu numer key not known to the compani and which is essenti to the secur of inform store in the phone .Secur vulner in Appl product have becom increasingli prize by hacker in recent year , given the ubiqu of the company mobil devic . Yet as interest ha grown in attack Apple hardwar and softwar , the company own secur team have been in flux .Appl previous had two main secur team  a group call Core OS Secur Engin and a product secur team .

Mr. DeAtley did not respond to request for comment .A few other member of the team also depart . Other join Appl as the compani acquir a hand of secur outfit last year , includ LegbaCor , which previous found and fix flaw for Appl .Some of the departur had more to do with market forc , the former Appl employe said . Secur profession are some of the most sought-aft engin in the technolog sector .Whether Apple secur oper will ever obtain inform about how the govern hack into Mr. Farook iPhon remain unclear .It possibl that the govern wont say how it open the iPhon becaus the method is proprietari to the compani that help the F.B.I. ,  said Stewart A.

We have to be veri attent to keep our part of the bargain if we want other to do the thing that wer tri to use sanction to creat the pressur for them to do.Both in hi speech at the Carnegi Endow for Intern Peac and in the interview , Mr. Lew acknowledg the difficulti of reliev Iranian of nuclear-rel sanction given their other offens  support for terror and human right violat  that have provok separ sanction by both the Unit State and it alli .The nuclear sanction were includ in four Unit Nation resolut dure the Georg W.

And , Mr. Lew said , the Unit State must continu to invest money in a sanction infrastructur  investig , analyst , monitor and lawyer  togeth with busi , bank and foreign govern and institut .Ahead of Mr. Lew speech , expert from recent administr echo hi messag on the danger of overreli on sanction , as effect as they can be .He react to some real pressur ,  said Juan C. Zarat , a former counterterror advis to Presid Georg W. Bush and the author of a 2013 book , Treasury War ,  on financi weapon develop sinc Sept. 11 , 2001 .One is the desir to continu use these measur for each and everi crisi in a maximalist way ,  by Congress , foreign govern and interest group , Mr. Zarat said . But he also seen that there is pressur from the privat sector for prudenc .Nichola Burn , a career diplomat who serv in the Clinton and Georg W. Bush administr and draft the first sanction against Iran under Mr. Bush , said sanction have been use much more intens in the last 10 to 15 year than they had been befor . And Im a propon becaus it doe give you an option other than military.Mr. Burn ad : But you do have to ask the question , Can they be overus ? And you have to be care when you exact sanction that they actual work . Becaus if they dont work , then your not credible.', 'Hous Republican releas a draft of a rescu plan for Puerto Rico on Tuesday that they hope could quickli garner bipartisan support and win over skeptic on the island , on Wall Street and in Congress .The plan , be draft by Republican on the Hous Natur Resourc Committe , in consult with Democrat in Congress and the Treasuri Depart , call for put Puerto Rico financ under a presidenti appoint oversight board  a bitter pill to mani on the island .Thi discuss draft will chang ,  said Repres Rob Bishop , Republican of Utah , who ha been lead the draft process . We are releas it now to encourag feedback.The plan would also establish guidelin for restructur some portion of Puerto Rico $ 72 billion of debt , where necessary. While Puerto Rico would not be grant stand to seek relief in bankruptci  someth it leader want  it could get some of the legal tool found in bankruptci as long as it first jump through a number of hoop .Creditors demand for immedi payment would be halt for 18 month , for exampl , much as creditor lawsuit are automat stay in bankruptci case . Under certain circumst Puerto Rico would also have the author to impos loss on unwil creditor  an extraordinari power that is normal avail onli in bankruptci . The oversight board duti would includ keep Puerto Rico from abus that power .To some on the island , ani feder oversight board at all is a deal-break .Shortli after a summari of the committee approach began to circul late last week , the governor of Puerto Rico , Alejandro Garca Padilla , denounc it as shame and degrad ,  and someth that would depriv the island of it own government.The presid of the Puerto Rican Senat , Eduardo Bhatia , said upon read the propos that he wa deepli offend by the way it wa written , which he said wa from the 18th centuri ,  evok the worst coloni subjugations.Congression staff must work at a pace seldom seen in Washington these day , becaus between May 1 and Juli 1 Puerto Rico owe debt payment total around $ 2.4 billion . By set up a legal framework befor that , Congress may be abl to prevent the chao and devast of a disorderli default .That mean devis a packag accept both to Democrat , who tend to support debt relief for Puerto Rico , and to conserv Republican , who see debt relief as a bailout that would unaccept reward profligaci .Get a bill onto Presid Obama desk for signatur would also mean find common ground with Senat Republican , who have seem less will to assist Puerto Rico , cite it failur to make requir financi disclosur .Given the need to act quickli , Hous aid said , lawmak were tri not to be overli prescript ,  and were leav mani detail of the rescu plan for the five appoint and two ex-officio oversight board member to sort out . They said they hope to have a bill readi to be introduc when Congress return from Easter recess in April .Mr. Garca Padilla ha been call Puerto Rico $ 72 billion of debt unpayable for almost a year , and ask Congress for extraordinari power to reduc it . If there had to be an oversight board in the process , the governor had envis it made up primarili of peopl from Puerto Rico .On Saturday , he call for candid for governor from all parti on the island to form a unit front to block the packag as written .Mr. Bhatia said that as Senat presid , he knew enough about the legisl process to know the packag would be revis . It ha to be amend , becaus as written it is not go to pass ,  he said .All over the island , peopl have been take on the airwav and social media to hash out their thought about the rescu plan , even though almost none of them had seen a copi of it .Larg number seem to disagre with the governor , say they would accept a feder oversight board . Some said they expect feder oversight to be like surgeri  pain , but necessari to Puerto Rico recoveri .The small but well-regard Puerto Rico Independ Parti reject outright the governor call for unifi opposit , say hi longstand support for Puerto Rico territori statu made uniti imposs .And in Washington , Puerto Rico nonvot member of Congress , Pedro Pierluisi , said that the governor posit wa complet unrealistic. He said that if Puerto Rico expect Washington to help it reduc it debt , then it should not be surpris when Washington want a closer look .Mr. Pierluisi , a Democrat , also said that he had found dozen of thing in the draft propos that he thought should be chang , and that he plan to keep work with the Republican .Investor were less vocifer than critic on the island , but they still found fault with certain part of the rescu packag .The Mainstreet Bondhold , an organ seek to repres small investor , express concern about the idea of halt creditor lawsuit . The group said it want reassur that no one would get preferenti treatment .Steve Spencer , a financi advis to creditor group , said the most troubl aspect he could see wa the rescu plan broad cramdown provision.Cramdown can happen when compani declar bankruptci under Chapter 11 . They are not , in gener , controversi becaus Chapter 11 also give creditor legal tool to fight them . But Chapter 9 municip bankruptci also provid for cramdown , and dure the recent flurri of bankruptci in place like Detroit and Stockton , Calif. , creditor discov that the law gave them no way to protect themselv .Now , Mr. Spencer said , creditor see the same risk in the Puerto Rico rescu plan .The bill would retroact elimin an import investor protect , reli upon by million of individu investor throughout the U.S. mainland and Puerto Rico ,  he said in a statement on Tuesday . A a result , the bill would transfer billion of dollar from retail investor and retire to pay for Puerto Rico mismanag and reckless spending.He said he hope the peopl shape the rescu plan would remain open to stakehold input  and we look forward to be a construct part of that process.Mr. Pierluisi said everybodi had a stake in get a restructur framework in place befor the big default expect in May and Juli .If a bill doe not becom law , Puerto Rico and it creditor will almost certainli go over a cliff  togeth  thi summer ,  he said .', 'WASHINGTON  The Unit State is in the midst of one of the longest econom expans in it histori . Even American factori have late ad hundr of thousand of job .Meanwhil , the rest of the world is stumbl . Even China .Yet at perhap the least like moment in the last sever decad , misgiv about global are play a star role in the presidenti elect . Whi now ?Anger about unbalanc trade ha help to fuel the rise of Donald J. Trump , the Republican front-runn , and the success of Senat Berni Sander of Vermont in hi bid for the Democrat nomin . The manifest anger also ha push their princip rival , Republican Senat Ted Cruz and the Democrat front-runn , Hillari Clinton , to toughen their own trade rhetor .It is a situat that ha surpris mani expert becaus poll show voters concern about the overal health of the American economi ha declin significantli in recent year .Yet mani American are just take stock of the transform wrought by global trade . In two dozen convers with voter across the countri , onli two said they had heard of the propos new trade deal , the Trans-Pacif Partnership , involv the Unit State and a host of Pacif Rim nation .Instead , the concern they express were about chang in their own live and commun over the last coupl of decad .When we first did that big trade agreement I thought it wa a good idea , but now Im get a littl more conserv about it ,  said Phylli Arthur , a 74-year-old Republican from Walnut Creek , Calif. I think wer be overwhelm by the good come in . That practic all that avail in the stores.Kevin White , a 47-year-old Democrat from Dayton , Ohio , said it wa hard to find a job . He use to work at a hospit ; now he get feder disabl payment .The job went oversea ,  lament Mr. White . Then peopl couldnt afford their mortgag and we had a crash and nobodi wa abl to buy anything.Dougla Irwin , an economist at Dartmouth Colleg who studi trade , said the impact of China econom rise had becom more visibl in recent year , even though the worst effect of it rise may alreadi be in the past .Between 2000 and 2011 , import from China grew to equal 2.6 percent of American econom output , up from around 1 percent . That unpreced shock wa much larger than that from the increas in Japanes import in the 1980 or Mexican import in the 1990 , Mr. Irwin said . China rise , fuel in part by currenc manipul to make it export cheaper , play a key role in the loss of roughli five million American manufactur job .Those loss , howev , were offset and obscur dure the hous boom by a rise in construct job . Now , both the factori job and the construct job have gone away .Ration , said Mr. Irwin , It too late to get upset about China.The Unit State is no longer lose factori job . It ha ad 600,000 over the last five year . Beij is no longer suppress it currenc ; it now tri to prop up the valu .Polit , howev , it appear that the moment is perfectli ripe .Ahead of anoth Rust Belt primari next Tuesday in Wisconsin , Mr. Trump is press for fair trade with foreign countri , while Mr. Cruz ha adopt similar languag . Wer go to see million and million of new high pay job ,  Mr. Cruz told a crowd at an Oshkosh plastic factori on Monday , come back to America , come back from China , come back from Mexico.Person also appear to be play a role . Mr. Trump ha prove an unusu effect spokesman for concern among Republican voter . You look at those empti factori all over the place , and nobodi hit that messag better than me ,  he said after win the Republican primari in Michigan thi month .Mr. Sander ha connect with a Democrat base whose support for Presid Obama may have damp longstand concern about trade .Mr. Trump and Mr. Sander have also succeed in focus anger on trade as an explan for broader econom problem afflict mani American . Trade flow make up a small part of America econom activ . The primari explan for the stagnat of middle-class incom are necessarili domest .They are follow in the footstep of politician of all stripe who have found it conveni to blame the boogeyman of unfair trade for domest econom problem ,  said Eswar Prasad , a Cornel economist . Tough talk on trade is an easi way to distract attent from take on difficult domest challenges.Mainstream economist regard the evid as unequivoc that trade ha produc signific benefit for the American economi and the averag household .Yet much of the American public ha long been skeptic . A recent New York Times/CB News poll found that 61 percent of respond favor more trade restrict to protect domest industri , just as a major of respond ha favor increas restrict in everi such poll sinc 1988 .Charl Shank began to chang hi mind about foreign trade in the earli 2000 as he carri the piec of Pennsylvania factori south to the Mexican border to be reassembl there .Mr. Shank , then work as a truck driver , support the expans of trade with Mexico and Canada . A regist Republican , Mr. Shank said he subscrib to the party posit that trade deal would open new market for American compani .But Mr. Shank , now retir , said the politician made a mistak . He said he plan to vote in Pennsylvania come presidenti primari for a candid who would go back and renegotiate better deal with the nation trade partner .I think our trade deal were good idea with good intent , but I dont think it had enough control to protect the Unit State ,  said Mr. Shank , 65 . The fact that the factori are leav , there someth wrong with that whole system right there.At the same time , Mr. Shank ha person benefit from global . He spent year drive import good to market . Trade reduc the price of hi televis and hi cloth and increas the varieti of food avail at the local groceri store .Like mani American , Mr. Shank said he would still rather pay more for American good . A recent Bloomberg poll conduct by Selzer & Compani found just 13 percent of respond said they want good at the lowest price , while 82 percent of respond said they want good made in America .But do they ?Mr. Shank said he ha alway driven Dodg truck .He paus .Actual ,  he said , thi year , I bought a Mazda.Economist and politician underst the cost of global , which tend to be more concentr than the benefit . Everyon get a discount ; some peopl lose their job . Moreov , the Unit State ha lag significantli behind other develop countri in provid support for those left behind .Linda Young lost a good job in 1998 when Munekata America , which made plastic case for televis and other electron , close it factori in Dalton , Ga. , becaus most of the compani it serv had move to Mexico . Ms. Young work until the factory final day , pack equip so it , too , could be ship to Mexico .Ms. Young , 62 , ran a restaur for a few year .

But she wa think about Dalton declin when she decid to vote for Mr. Trump in Georgia Republican primari .I dont see their futur be better than mine ,  Ms. Young said of her grandchildren .

When the debat over Valeant account of it tie with the mail-ord pharmaci Philidor Rx Servic first began to rage , a report last Octob by the short seller Citron Research fan the flame by compar Valeant to Enron .The Valeant-as-Enron theori wa given a boost after Valeant fail to file it annual report on time becaus of an account restat and after the board accus the company former chief financi offic , Howard B. Schiller , of engag in improp conduct. For hi part , Mr. Schiller say he ha done noth wrong .The Enron theori is seduct , but Valeant is a real oper busi that by all account is profit . Unlik Enron , Valeant is not use account to cover up huge and unsustain loss . Inde , so far the account restat have amount to onli $ 58 million worth of revenu . And while there may be more account restat on the horizon , there is no indic of outright fraud .Thi view ha gain traction in recent week . Valeant chief execut , J. Michael Pearson , is a former consult at McKinsey , have spent 23 year there . And he appar surround himself with former McKinsey peopl on hi team .So did Valeant problem aris from a McKinsey-driven etho devot to drive sharehold valu through financi machin ? Arguabl , in the name of these McKinsey principl , Valeant wa move to Canada , shut down larg portion of it research and develop oper and becam a vacuum swallow up other pharmaceut compani , all key to it growth strategi .The McKinsey theori ha surfac appeal  after all , it is easi to make fun of consult and their PowerPoint present . But McKinsey execut have also been at the forefront of argument about long-term sharehold valu and more disciplin acquisit polici . Elsewher , McKinsey ha form an entir initi on invest in long-term capit .For good or bad , McKinsey advis thousand of compani , includ mani drug compani that do not engag in Valeant busi strategi .Thi argument assert that Valeant busi choic are come home to roost . Valeant built itself on spend a reduc amount on research and develop . Instead , it paid to acquir drug and in some case built profit by rais price . Thi busi strategi creat it downfal  by fail to focu on develop drug , Valeant left itself expos to failur .The foundat of thi theori is the nonsens notion that research and develop can never be bad . Mani drug compani , howev , have been unabl to capit on billion of dollar in research and develop and are now resort to purchas . Gilead Scienc , for exampl , made itself into a $ 100 billion compani larg through the acquisit of a hepat C drug .Sharehold activist are current take aim at technolog compani for excess spend on research and develop without result . Not focus on R. & D . ; wa part of Valeant busi model , but that wa not necessarili a problem in today world . Inde it made econom sens for Valeant . The compani focus on sale and price  someth at which it excel , at least for a while  while other did the develop .Thi view , made popular amid the uproar over Martin Shkreli , ha a feel-good natur to it . Propon of thi theori focu on the fact that part of Valeant busi strategi wa to buy drug and sharpli rais the price . Now , with congression scrutini and other attack , Valeant ha back away from thi approach . The halt to thi price strategi would seem to explain Valeant declin .The first problem with thi theori is that we dont have transpar around Valeant price , or inde that of ani pharmaceut compani . Valeant headlin price increas were most like fought by insur , and the actual increas were no doubt reduc in those battl .It is clear that to the extent Valeant expans strategi reli on increas price , that is no longer a viabl road to growth . But that doe not mean there should be a sudden collaps of Valeant . After all , the drug in it current stabl of product are price where they are and still sell .In thi scenario , the blame lie with the sharehold activist fund ValueAct , which partli creat the modern-day Valeant . ValueAct arrang for the hire of Mr. Pearson and particip in creat a compens packag , which , includ hi stock and option , wa worth at one point as much as $ 3 billion .ValueAct also press Valeant to focu on cut research and develop ( someth that the fund also push at Microsoft ) and use acquisit as a substitut . For a time , thi wa an extraordinarili success strategi . Even now , ValueAct is still in the black on the Valeant invest .The problem with target ValueAct is that thi explain the busi strategi , but it doe not help us understand what went wrong .There is certainli blame all around for the hedg fund that bid up Valeant stock price . The Sequoia Fund , for exampl , inexplic put more than a quarter of it portfolio into Valeant . ( In a you-cant-make-this-up sidelight , Sequoia chairman is Roger Lowenstein , the author of When Geniu Fail ,  about the collaps of Long-Term Capit Manag . )These investor should have known better than to chase return , but thi again ha noth to do with Valeant busi .It is clear there are problem at Valeant , but if Wall Street built Valeant , it is now run away from it . And the veloc of the turnaround ha distort all view of the compani . It ha creat a volatil unteth by realiti . In the Wall Street worldview , Valeant is worth either zero or it is worth $ 100 a share .But Valeant is a real compani . It doe not make sens for a compani with earn befor interest , tax , depreci and amort , or Ebitda , of about $ 5 billion a year to be worth onli $ 9 billion . A rival drug compani , Allergan , for exampl , with Ebitda of $ 7 billion a year and $ 40 billion of debt , is worth $ 110 billion .To be sure , Valeant ha about $ 30 billion in debt upon which it might technic default if it can not file it annual financi statement by April 29 . But such a situat is not that uncommon . Compani typic pay a fee to the bank and get a waiver from the debthold .There is no doubt that Valeant ha taken a major hit . The crisi ha crush it previou busi model of rais price and make acquisit . Thi ha left it a compani in transit . Valeant may still take some wrong step , but wherev it goe from here , one cant ignor the busi it alreadi ha  with billion of dollar in earn .The intrins worth of that busi remain essenti the same . It is the compani that is suffer from a crisi of confid . The flight by Wall Street shut down Valeant old busi growth model , not it busi .But understand requir think that is a bit too clear-ey for Wall Street , which when thing go bad , prefer the worst . And sometim it creat a self-fulfil frenzi . Rememb the financi crisi , after all .', 'Lester C.

Now theyr a disaster.The util that run the project , SaskPow , and advoc for carbon captur argu that the setback are typic teeth problem associ with ani new and complex technolog .Over time , as more compani , countri engag in carbon captur and storag technolog , the price for everybodi is go to come down ,  Mike Marsh , the chief execut of SaskPow , told a legisl committe in Januari . That will make it easier to employ.The Boundari Dam Power Station sit near a wealth of resourc not far from the North Dakota border .Hundr of year of coal reserv are buri under the ground nearbi , virtual elimin transport cost . And the mine creat employ in an area with limit job prospect .It a low-cost , stabl suppli ,  Mr. Marsh said . There a tremend opportun in North America to continu to util coal.To the util and the provinci govern , the process known as carbon captur and storag seem tantal when a review of the power system began 11 year ago .The technolog offer a way to stick with coal in a carbon-consci era . It wa especi attract in Canada , where rise emiss from the oil sand have more than offset reduct elsewher , includ Ontario abandon of coal-fir electr gener .Through the process , machineri would first remov most of the soot and ash from the coal exhaust . The exhaust would then pass through a kind of chemic call an amin that would snatch the carbon , in the form of carbon dioxid , out of it . The gather carbon dioxid , separ from the amin , would be compress , move through pipelin and ultim buri underground .Variat of the technolog have been use as far back as the 1920 . And small demonstr project have larg work , includ one in Norway that open in 2012 .Boundari Dam , which receiv a major Canadian subsidi and open in Septemb 2014 , wa the first full-scal deploy of the technolog to cut emiss from burn coal . Saskatchewan pick a process own by Shell , encourag by it histori with petrochem .At the outset , the util and the provinc said the project wa work as intend , captur 90 percent of the plant carbon . It wa the equival , they said , of take 250,000 car off the road . Environmentalist and politician from around the world came to check out Boundari Dam .But the success stori disintegr last Novemb when Ms. Sproul , a member of the opposit New Democrat Parti , unveil the confidenti document in the provinci legislatur . She wouldnt identifi the peopl who provid the document , although the govern confirm their authent .The document show that the system wa work at onli 45 percent of capac . One memo , written a month after the govern publicli boast about the project , cite eight major problem area . Fix them , it said , could take a year and a half , and the memo warn that it wa not immedi appar how to resolv some problem .A chart cover the first year of oper show that the system often didnt work at all . When it wa turn back on after shutdown for adjust and repair , the amount of carbon captur sometim even drop .The buoyant public remark , Mr. Marsh said , accur reflect the company earli assess of the system . We were veri optimist when thi plant came onlin ,  he said .Still , he acknowledg that there were a few statement that it wa achiev more than it had. Mr. Marsh character mani of the problem as design issu , such as inadequ temperatur control system , rather than fundament flaw .But Boundari Dam ha expos a problem with Shell process when use with coal exhaust . Despit the plant initi filter , tini particl of ash still remain in the exhaust and contamin the amin , reduc it abil to grab carbon , Mr. Marsh said .Over all , we are pleas with the perform of the captur technolog ,  Shell Canada said in a statement , ad that it wa work with SaskPow to optim oper and captur ani lesson that can be appli to improv futur projects.But the cost are pile up .One shutdown last spring to clean and replenish the chemic cost 17 million Canadian dollar . Mr. Marsh said that the compani wa still look for a way to prevent the contamin .The repeat shutdown have caus SaskPow to miss multipl carbon dioxid deliveri to Cenovu Energi , the Canadian oil compani that sign a 10-year contract with the util to buy most of the ga . ( Cenovu use carbon dioxid to forc oil from larg deplet well . ) SaskPow ha had to pay 7 million Canadian dollar in penalti , offset most of the 9 million Canadian dollar in payment receiv .On top of that , the carbon system is a voraci consum of the electr gener by Boundari Dam , which ha 150 megawatt of capac . Mr. Marsh testifi that about 30 megawatt of capac were consum by the system , and an addit 15 to 16 megawatt were need to compress the carbon dioxid .Tim Boersma , the act director of the energi secur and climat initi at the Brook Institut , said that extens power loss is a signific factor keep other util from follow SaskPower lead .That is exactli the reason thi is not go to fli ,  Mr. Boersma said . The plant effici goe down so dramatically.As it continu to sort out the plant problem , SaskPow is damp expect . The util cut it emiss reduct target for thi year to 800,000 metric ton , from one million .The compani said it is work with the engin firm that design the project to solv the problem and increas effici . Mr. Marsh said there were indic that perform wa improv . Last month , the util said the system wa work at 67 percent of capac .Even some environmentalist are hope for a turnaround .Georg Perida , a senior scientist with the Natur Resourc Defens Council climat and clean air program , said hi group did not endors the use of coal , but it accept that coal would continu to be part of the energi mix .Carbon captur , he said , will be a vital part of reduc emiss . Base on discuss with SaskPow , Mr. Perida said he wa confid that Boundari Dam would eventu work out .I dont see ani indic that the carbon captur system of thi plant is broken ,  Mr. Perida said . It had a bumpi start.', 'He is often compar in the media to Warren E. Buffett . Like the American billionair , he is leverag hi control of an insur compani to becom one of the biggest name in global financ . Like Mr. Buffett , he look to be acquir an immens person fortun .But that is where the comparison between Wu Xiaohui , the chairman of the Anbang Insur Group of China , and Mr. Buffett come to a halt .Mr. Buffett is a public figur who built hi fortun over decad . Mr. Wu avoid interview . The fax number on hi company websit connect to a dentist offic . And , unlik Mr. Buffett , whose net worth can be easili calcul , Mr. Wu fortun is a cipher , lost in Anbang labyrinthin sharehold structur made up of 37 interlock hold compani .At a time of grow demand for transpar in busi and financ , some expert say it is strike that an opaqu Chines insur is forg headline-grab deal in the Unit State , especi in an elect year that ha put China econom influenc under scrutini as never befor .Mr. Wu compani , which say it ha asset of more than $ 291 billion , is now in an intens bid war with Marriott Intern for control of Starwood Hotel & Resort . On Monday , Anbang rais it offer to $ 14 billion . Earlier thi month , Anbang agre to pay $ 6.5 billion to the Blackston Group for a portfolio of luxuri hotel such as the Essex Hous in New York . In late 2014 , Anbang bought the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York for almost $ 2 billion .Anbang , found onli in 2004 , explod in size two year ago , as those same 37 compani pour billion of dollar into it coffer .Ani time somebodi in China magic snap their finger and ha a lot of money , in thi case a coloss amount of money , that set off red flag for me ,  said Christoph Bald , associ professor of financ and econom at Peke University campu in Shenzhen , a citi in southern China . It in their interest to share inform to say we come in peac ,  but there just not that cultur of information-shar . In China , when peopl are hide thi amount of inform , it for a reason.Mr. Wu ha link to some of the most power famili in China . He marri Zhuo Ran , the granddaught of Deng Xiaop , China former paramount leader in the 1980 and much of the 1990 . That name , uncommon in Chines , appear in corpor record tie to at least two of the 37 hold compani .An Anbang director , Chen Xiaolu , is the son of a famou militari command who fought alongsid Mao Zedong . Mr. Chen name ha appear as a top offic in at least four of the Anbang compani , accord to a review of record file onlin with Chines offici . In 2014 , the name of Levin Zhu , the son of former Premier Zhu Rongji , also show up on Anbang list of director .Mr. Chen ha said he doe not own Anbang share . Mr. Zhu told local media last week that he never agre to be on Anbang board . Neither could be reach for comment .Anbang join a well-worn path use by Chines compani that enter the global financi system with tie to China polit elit . Among that group is Ping An Insur , a vehicl of immens wealth for rel of former Premier Wen Jiabao , and Dalian Wanda Commerci Properti , invest in by rel or busi associ of at least four former or current member of the Communist Party rule Politburo , includ the older sister of Presid Xi Jinp .Call to Anbang list phone number were not answer . Nobodi repli to a list of question deliv to it Beij headquart , with it enorm lobbi  the size of sever basketbal court  and it larg chandeli . An Anbang employe said the compani did not answer media question .Mr. Wu , 49 , a nativ of the citi of Wenzhou in eastern China Zhejiang provinc , in rare public appear talk of Anbang abil to gener high return from the compani it take over and the benefit to it corpor cultur of global .For instanc , if you choos to stay in rural villag , you can onli meet common villag girl ; yet if you come to Pari , you will have the chanc to lay your eye on the Mona Lisa ,  Mr. Wu told Harvard Univers student earli last year .Hi exact hold in Anbang are not clear . A close examin of Anbang sharehold structur show that the 37 compani control more than 93 percent of Anbang , while two Chines state-own compani own the rest . The 37 sharehold are link by common phone number , email address and interlock ownership , accord to compani record file with the Chines govern and avail onlin .For exampl , one Anbang sharehold  a coal mine compani in China western region of Xinjiang  is own by anoth mine compani , Zhongya Huajin , that list a Zhuo Ran as it first legal repres , though that person ha sinc resign .Zhongya Huajin share an offici websit address with a differ Anbang sharehold , a Beij real estat compani . Collect , those compani own nearli 4.6 billion share of Anbang , or more than 7 percent . The compani could not be reach for comment , and their common websit now contain onli link to pornographi and gambl servic .Five sharehold list the same legal email address in govern file . Phone at those compani rang unansw , and a messag to that address wa not return .The compani inject billion of dollar in capit into Anbang in 2014 , it document show , increas it regist capit fivefold from 2011 level and make it bigger than ani other Chines insur compani . Warren Buffett got wealthi by grow a small insur compani into a behemoth ,  Mr . Bald said . Thi is the exact opposit of that.Collect , the group of 37 compani control enough of Anbang to make ani one person one of China wealthiest individu . Mr. Wu is not list in the document as a major sharehold , and he doe not appear on wealth-track list compil by media compani .A Chines media report last year identifi two peopl list as director or sharehold in six of the 37 compani as Mr. Wu sibl . The report , by the Southern Weekend newspap , wa later remov from it websit . Southern Weekend issu an apolog to Anbang , state that there were inaccuracies in the articl , without specifi what they were .Chang Ping , a former news depart director of the paper who wa not employ by Southern Weekend at the time , said that the apolog had been made under pressure for polit reason .', 'FALL RIVER , Mass .

The state , home base for the American auto industri , also deliv an upset victori to Berni Sander , the Democrat anti-Nafta standard-bear .But the autoworkers animos is aim at the wrong target . There are still more than 800,000 job in the American auto sector . And there is a good case to be made that without Nafta , there might not be much left of Detroit at all .Without the abil to move lower-wag job to Mexico we would have lost the whole industri ,  said Gordon Hanson of the Univers of California , San Diego , who ha been studi the impact of Nafta on industri and worker sinc it incept more than two decad ago .Even in the narrowest sens  to protect job in car assembl plant  a wall of tariff against America southern neighbor would probabl do more harm than good .To be sure , Rust Belt voter drawn to Mr. Trump and Mr. Sander are not wrong to be angri . Trade and the deal to reduc trade barrier often threaten the livelihood of worker in the industri expos most directli to foreign competit .In the home of the onc proud Big Three carmak , which virtual own the American car market through most of the 20th centuri , the issu is person . Nafta put them in direct competit with Mexican worker earn littl more than one-fifth of their compens .The American trade deficit in auto and part tripl in the two decad after the trade deal struck with Mexico and Canada took effect in 1994 , to about $ 130 billion in 2013 . The industri lost 350,000 job , or about a third of it worker , over the period .It wa a massiv shift in a flagship industri ,  said Thea Lee , deputi chief of staff of the A.F.L.-C.I.O .Worker , she said , were promis one thing but got anoth . One thing you need to understand about whi working-class peopl are so cynic about these trade agreement ,  Ms. Lee said , i that everi time we had these big debat , and they heard these optimist project and it never turn out the way they were told it would be.Still , for all the brickbat thrown at it , the Nafta trade deal itself had a rel modest impact , most studi agre . For one thing , the Mexican economi is still tini compar with that of the Unit State and it trade surplu ha remain rel small .China , where worker were even cheaper and which ha attract far more foreign invest in manufactur , ultim bump Mexico out of mani American market after Beij enter the World Trade Organ in 2001 .Nafta is often blame for dynam that are not of it make . The surg of Mexican export in the 1990 wa propel by a sharp devalu of the peso , which set off the so-cal Tequila Crisi . The wave of immigr from Mexico into the Unit State , which last until 2005 , wa driven by a declin in govern subsidi to farmer and an econom collaps that occur just as million of young Mexican were enter their late teen and were desper for job .Lui Rubio , who head the Center of Research for Develop in Mexico Citi  known as CIDAC for it spell in Spanish  complain that Nafta get the blame for the whole packag of global and breakneck technolog chang that took off more or less at the same time .Nafta is also blame for lot of thing that are actual becaus of competit with China ,  he told me .The truth is that autowork in Detroit were not just compet with cheap worker in Mexico . They were also compet with American worker in the union-avers South , where mani car compani set up shop . They were compet with robot and more effici Japanes and Korean automak .Detroit respond by cut as mani costli factori job as it could . But valu ad by the car and car-part maker in the Unit State is onli slightli lower than it wa in 1993 .The integr of product across countri with complementari labor forc  cheaper worker in Mexico to perform mani basic task , with more highli paid and product engin and worker in the Unit State  turn out to play a central role in reviv the auto industri in North America .In the final analysi , Nafta might have save hundr of thousand of job . By offer a low-wag platform , Mexican plant increas the scale of product in North America , allow domest and foreign automak to amort their larg fix cost . Carmak and part supplier tend to cluster rel close togeth . So assembl plant in Mexico help sustain a robust auto-part industri across North America .The Honda CR-V assembl in El Salto , Jalisco , for exampl , use an American-mad motor and transmiss . Roughli 70 percent of it content is either American or Canadian , accord to govern statist .Thi region integr gave the Unit States-bas auto industri a competit edg that wa critic to it surviv . There wa a concern 20 year ago that an auto industri product chain would develop across Asia , includ China and Taiwan and Southeast Asia ,  Professor Hanson said .

Over the past few year , Bombardi , Cessna and Hawker Beechcraft have set up shop there , among other . Just as Michigan autowork might thank Nafta for keep China from take over the global auto industri , aerospac worker might one day have Nafta to thank for keep the Chines out , too .It exactli the wrong time to blow up Nafta ,  Professor Hanson argu .

Like automobil buyer , howev , airlin gener do not pay the post price , and Delta is known as a canni negoti . Delta ha taken option for an addit 50 aircraft beyond the 75 .Stumbl within Bombardi , combin with particularli aggress competit from it larger rival , had led mani analyst to question Bombardier decis to tri leverag it success in the market for small region jet by build an airplan that could compet directli with the Boe 737 and the Airbu A320 .The support from a major airlin , after a recent letter of intent from Air Canada to buy 45 of the CSeri plane , may begin to dispel specul that Bombardi may have to abandon the project . The develop of the CSeri ha creat a financi drain for the compani , which struggl to find buyer .Thi is a real big deal for us ,  Alain Bellemar , the presid and chief execut of Bombardi , said at a news confer at the factori northwest of Montreal were the plane are assembl . It a turn moment.Bombardi also said on Thursday that it had lost $ 138 million on sale of $ 3.9 billion dure it first quarter . For the compar period a year ago , the compani post a $ 100 million profit . With the Delta deal , Bombardi will hold 325 firm order when the CSeri will enter servic thi year , 25 more than the company target .The CSeri , which can carri 100 to 150 passeng , wa intend to be the first airlin use a new engin technolog from Pratt & Whitney , a unit of Unit Technolog . The engin is said to be unusu quiet and , accord to the compani , it requir up to 20 percent less fuel .But the CSeri project is more than two year behind schedul and vastli over budget . Delta will receiv it first deliveri of CS100 plane in earli 2018 .Although analyst have prais the CSeri as technic innov , the delay have allow Boe and Airbu to introduc version of their exist plane with engin said to offer similar innov . Although those slightli larger airplan are not as modern or fuel-effici as Bombardier offer , the two industri giant are abl to offer them at attract price .Ed Bastian , who will take over as Delta chief execut on Monday , said at the news confer that hi company purchas bring Bombardi in as the third competitor into the mainlin aircraft marketplac with Boe and Airbus.He ad : And we are thrill to be abl to have that choic in the marketplace.While the announc is expect to help creat momentum for further sale of the CSeri , it will not immedi resolv Bombardier financi problem .Evan Mann , an analyst with Gim me Credit , an independ debt research firm , call the Delta order a step in the right direction but maintain Bombardier underperform rate .The compani is still burn through cash , and the time as to when the CSeri program turn profit and becom free cash flow posit is still sometim away ,  Mr. Mann wrote .As the project drain Bombardi of cash , the compani wa forc to seek $ 1 billion in aid from the provinc of Quebec , which is now a sharehold in the CSeri .The compani is seek a similar bailout from the govern of Canada , led by Prime Minist Justin Trudeau . Negoti for that invest , howev , appear to have bog down on a number of question , includ the special vote share that give member of the found famili of Bombardi , a one-tim snowmobil maker , control of the compani .Dure a confer call with analyst on Thursday , Mr. Bellemar said that talk with the govern remain underway but suggest that feder money wa no longer necessari to keep the compani oper .

Yet most soda tax treat all sugari drink as if they have the same amount of sugar .That the structur of Mexico soda tax , which went into effect in 2014 and is be close watch by research . It also a featur of the soda tax in Berkeley , Calif. , the first American citi to pass one . Those tax appli a surcharg on everi liter or ounc of sugari drink , no matter how much sugar it ha .A new soda tax in Britain , expect to becom law , is differ .The British tax wont treat a full-calori soda and a lightli sweeten ice tea in the same way . Instead , it impos it tax in three bracket . Sugar-fre and low-sugar product , those with less than around three teaspoon of sugar for a 12-ounc can , arent subject to ani addit tax . Product with between three and five teaspoon , approxim , will pay a lower tax of around 9 cent for that can . Product like a standard cola , with more than nine teaspoon in a can , will pay more , about 12 cent . The result is a slightli more complic tax structur , but one that might provid some incent for beverag maker to offer healthier product .Donald Marron , an institut fellow at the Urban Institut who studi tax polici , said the tier price might steer price-sensit custom from high-sugar drink to lower-sugar one . But he think it bigger effect could be encourag compani to develop innov drink for the lower-tax categori .If there are small chang they can make to get under the threshold without realli affect mouth-feel and tast , they may well do that ,  he said . In a recent blog post , he hail the British idea as a better soda tax.Mr. Marron make hi own mid-calori product , he said , by mix diet and regular soda at soda fountain . But big soda compani have begun experi with more profession version of thi idea . Coca-Cola and Pepsi have recent releas lower-calori version of their flagship soda without elimin sugar entir . Coca-Cola Life , Pepsi Next and Pepsi True each have about two-third as mani calori as the origin . The compani also offer lower-sugar product in other categori , like ice tea .The beverag industri ha introduc these product in respons to consum demand for healthier drink . But they have also been spur by a voluntari pledg to lower the calori count in their beverag by 20 percent befor 2025 in the Unit State .The soda compani , natur , oppos soda tax . But a tax like the British one might give them more of a window to develop and sell these newer product .The British govern say thi is it hope , point to some beverag compani that have alreadi reduc sugar level .The independ Offic for Budget Respons expect that produc will chang their behavior as a result of thi levi , which will mean that the consumpt of high ad sugar soft drink should fall over time ,  the treasuri said in a fact sheet it releas .In the Unit State , consumpt of full-calori soda is alreadi declin . American are drink more than 25 percent less soda than they were in the late 1990 , a trend that is contribut to an overal declin in the number of calori consum by the averag American .In gener , sin tax have tend to follow the model of Berkeley soda tax . Alcohol tax are usual impos by categori and volum , not the proof of the drink . But there is one famou exampl of a tax propos along the line of the British soda tax : the carbon tax . That tax , as it is discuss by economist , is focus on the amount of the damag ingredi  carbon  not the product that contain it . Under a carbon tax formula , peopl who get energi from coal , a high-carbon fossil fuel , would pay more than those who get energi from natur ga , which emit less carbon .The result , in theori , is get peopl to focu on reduc the harm ingredi , not it vehicl .', 'Berni Sander had a great week . He won big in five Western caucus : Washington , Alaska , Idaho , Utah and Hawaii . It wa enough to whittl Hillari Clinton pledged-deleg lead to around 230 , despit her own solid win in Arizona .To get to a major , not count superdeleg , Mr. Sander now need more than 56 percent of the remain pledg deleg .It might not look too daunt after he just won at least 70 percent of the vote in five state . But the remain state arent especi welcom for him . Mrs. Clinton deleg advantag seem likeli to grow over the rest of the contest than to shrink . The remain state forc Mr. Sander to confront hi big weak : affluenc , divers , establishment-friendli area and close primari contest .To get a sens of how the rest of the Democrat race play out , consid how the remain state might vote if they follow the same demograph pattern of the first half of the primari season . The pattern includ the result for all of the state where The Associ Press ha report the result by counti .Our model estim that Mrs. Clinton would win around 54 percent of the remain deleg , not includ nonstat contest like Puerto Rico . She lose in a bunch of predominantli white , working-class state where Mr. Sander is hope to fare well : Wisconsin , Wyom , North Dakota , Kentucki , Oregon , Indiana and West Virginia . But she hold on in the affluent and divers state along the coast . Mr. Sander will need to win these state  and probabl by a comfort margin  to overtak her deleg lead .It import to note that thi type of a model is not a predict . It mere suppos that the rest of the campaign follow the same demograph pattern of the first half . And sometim voter go anoth way . The model put Mrs. Clinton on track for a big win in Michigan , which she ultim lost . After Michigan , the same approach predict a close race in demograph similar Ohio , where she got a big win .Just thi last week , Mr. Sander beat the expect of thi model in all five caucu state ( but underperform by more in Arizona ) . There no reason he cant do it again . But thi approach doe give a broad sens of what left , and it doesnt suggest a great opportun for Mr. Sander .Mrs. Clinton ha fare much wors in caucus and open contest  those that allow voter who arent regist as Democrat  than she ha in primari or close contest .So far , she ha done about nine percentag point better in primari than in caucus , and three point better in close contest than in open one .The five big win for Mr. Sander all came in open caucuses.There onli one open caucu left , North Dakota , and one close caucu , Wyom .Mr. Sander , convers , ha fare wors in close primari , like Arizona and Florida . These primari tend to exclud the independent-lean voter who most often support Mr. Sander . Regist Democrat also tend to be older ; the young , especi young white , are most like to regist as independ .There are a lot of close contest left , includ New York , Pennsylvania , Maryland , Connecticut , New Mexico , Delawar , Kentucki and Oregon . Mr. Sander ha not yet won a close primari .Mr. Sander will have the benefit of open or semi-open primari in just California , Montana , Wisconsin , Indiana and West Virginia .Mrs. Clinton tend to do best in affluent area . It wa even true in Mr. Sanders big win thi last week  she fare better in place like Seattle King Counti and Park City Summit Counti in Utah .The model estim that Mrs. Clinton would fare 27 point better in a counti where 100 percent of household made more than $ 100,000 a year than she would in a demograph similar counti where no household were so well off . She also doe better in place where the financ industri is strong .That good news for her in the Bay Area and the Northeastern corridor  two of the most affluent region of the countri . There ha alreadi been a sneak preview of her strength there : She won decis in Northern Virginia and the Boston metropolitan area .Mrs. Clinton fare best in area with larg number of Hispan or black voter . She doe better among these voter in the South than in the North , but it nonetheless an advantag for her in California and along the Acela Corridor , where there is an above-averag percentag of nonwhit voter .The model pick up on Mrs. Clinton strength among nonwhit voter in a few way , but the bottom line is that she ha won everi primari where white voter repres a below-averag share of the elector . She ha won all but one counti where nonwhit voter repres a major of elig voter in a primari  as is now the case in California as a whole .Her big win in Arizona might be particularli indic of her like strength in Southern California and the state Central Valley .Mr. Sander ha fare best in area known for support anti-establish polit  go all the way back to Teddi Roosevelt , Robert La Follett and Henri Wallac .Thi model use the last three major third-parti candid as a proxi for anti-establish sentiment : John Anderson in 1980 , Ross Perot in 1992 and Ralph Nader in 2000 . It ha anoth variabl for the Nader Democrats  the share of Nader voter in 2000 as a percentag of the total of Al Gore and Nader voter .These are veri power predictor of Mr. Sanders strength . Alaska , for instanc , ha the highest number of Nader Democrat and wa the best state for Mr. Sander outsid hi home state , Vermont .It bode well for Mr. Sander in Oregon , Montana and Wisconsin . But it wont go veri far for him in California or the Northeast .One thing Mr. Sander ha go for him are the anti-Obama Democrat .Mr. Sander ha gener fare poorli in the South and Appalachia , but he ha tend to do better in a surpris spot : area where there are larg number of the old regist Democrat who vote Republican in presidenti elect , but nonetheless find themselv trap in a Democrat primari thank to a close or semi-clos system .These conserv voter appear to be choos Mr. Sander in big number . You can see the trace of it in the stark increas in Mr. Sanders support when you cross from Georgia into the Florida Panhandl , a state with a close primari and parti registr . You can see it along the border of Oklahoma , and along the North Carolina border as well . It show up in anoth way : the larg number of voter who are vote for uncommitted or a minor candid .It not entir clear whether these voter actual support Mr. Sander . The exit poll in Oklahoma show Mr. Sander win big  59 percent to 24 percent  among the larg number ( 28 percent ) of voter who want the next presid to chang to less liber polici . That doesnt necessarili mean they dont support Mr. Sander ; perhap they think of liber in cultur term , like racial issu or gun . But it doe rais doubt . Mr. Sander won easili among the 17 percent of voter who trust neither candid in an intern crisi .The model account for thi with a surpris variabl : Barack Obama share of the vote in the 2012 Democrat primari . That not a typo . As presid and run without a major oppon , Mr. Obama won just 57 percent of the vote in Oklahoma in 2012 , thank to these conserv who still vote in Democrat primari .The pattern is good news for Mr. Sander in West Virginia and Kentucki , with the model put him over the top there , even though Mr. Sander ha lost almost all of the counti border these two state . Without thi variabl , Mrs. Clinton would be favor in both state .Mr. Sander ha the potenti to win sever state with more than 56 percent of the vote , like North Dakota , Wyom , Montana  and even Oregon , South Dakota and Wisconsin . But these state are worth just 13 percent of the remain deleg .Mrs. Clinton could easili win mani of the contest along the more divers and affluent East Coast in primari in Connecticut , Delawar , Maryland , New Jersey , New York and the District of Columbia .Even if Mrs. Clinton doesnt fare as well as the project suggest , Mr. Sander is veri unlik to win by a double-digit margin . He will have to make up for those deleg elsewher .Mr. Sander ha better opportun to win in California , Indiana , Kentucki , New Mexico and Rhode Island . But he is not a clear favorit in these state , and may be consid an underdog in the biggest prize : California .But Mr. Sander need more than mere a win in California . He need to win there by at least 20 percentag point , consid that he is unlik to win at least 56 percent of the vote along the Acela Corridor .So far , Mr. Sander ha won onli two of the 21 primari by more than 16 point : Vermont , hi home state , and neighbor New Hampshir .', 'WASHINGTON  A furiou legal battl over digit privaci in the age of the iPhon end on Monday with no clear winner  onli linger question over what will happen the next time the govern tri to forc Appl to help break into one of it own phone .The Justic Depart on Monday announc that it had gotten what it want most immedi in the case of the San Bernardino terrorist attack : a way to unlock the iPhon use by one of the shooter to determin what evid it might hold , even without Apple assist .But that develop forestal a court rule on the bigger legal question that have been so hotli debat sinc the case erupt last month when a judg in California order Appl to unlock the phone use by Sy Rizwan Farook .The legal debat in that state offer what mani legal analyst saw as a power test case for the Justic Depart to establish it posit . But that verdict will now have to wait for anoth day .Thi might be a miss opportun for the Justic Depart ,  said Eric Berg , a former feder prosecutor who now work on electron surveil case at a privat practic in Milwauke . Have thi whole debat mute by thi solut is probabl a littl bit disappoint for them.Likewis , the develop repres an uneven result for privaci advoc . They could claim some measur of victori becaus Appl wa abl to hold to it posit without give in to the govern , but an appar flaw in Apple vaunt encrypt protocol wa worrisom .Unfortun , thi news appear to be just a delay of an inevit fight over whether the F.B.I . can forc Appl to undermin the secur of it own product ,  said Alex Abdo , staff attorney for the American Civil Liberti Union .The Justic Depart did not say whether it would seek to use the method discov for access the San Bernardino phone in ani other case . Law enforc offici have said they have been lock out of dozen of other phone as a result of encrypt safeguard , and the unlock method  a tightli held secret at the F.B.I .  could be valuabl in mani of those case as well . But some law enforc offici said it wa too earli to say anyth about their abil to access other phone .With the Justic Depart move on Monday to withdraw it motion forc Apple cooper in the San Bernardino case , Appl is still on the win side in a separ but relat case in feder court in Brooklyn .In that case , Unit State Magistr Judg Jame Orenstein in the eastern district of New York rule last month in a 50-page opinion that the Justic Depart wa not entitl to forc Apple cooper in unlock a drug dealer iPhon . He said that prosecutor were take too broad a rule of a 1789 statut known as the All Writ Act in seek to secur Apple cooper .The Justic Depart is appeal hi decis .Mr. Berg , the Milwauke lawyer , said that although the San Bernardino fight might have end without a court decis and a clear verdict , thi case ha forc a nation dialogu , and it realli ha brought thi issu front and center .

But it could also increas unemploy among some of the veri same econom margin worker the wage increas is intend to help .Mani economist , even some on the left , worri that a potenti loss of job in a number of citi where wage are compar low could larg offset , and perhap even more than offset , the boon of higher incom at the bottom of the wage scale .Just as the benefit of thi polici are like to be greater becaus it cover a greater share of the work forc than for past minimum wage increas , the risk of these cost is also higher ,  said Ben Zipper , an expert on the minimum wage at the liber Washington Center for Equit Growth . It veri unclear how that go to stack up.San Francisco and San Jose , both high-wag citi that have benefit from the tech boom , are like to weather the increas without so much as a rippl . The neg consequ of the minimum wage increas in Lo Angel and San Diego  larg citi where wage are lower  are like to be more pronounc , though they could remain modest on balanc .But in lower-wag , inland citi like Bakersfield and Fresno , the effect could play out in much less predict way . That becaus the rise of the minimum wage to $ 15 over the next six year would push the wage floor much closer to the expect pay for a worker in the middl of the wage scale , affect a much higher proport of employe and employ there than in high-wag citi .Thi is a big experi ,  said Arindrajit Dube , an econom professor at the Univers of Massachusett at Amherst whose work ha shown that modest minimum wage increas typic have limit effect on employ . In area like Fresno , a major of worker are like to be directli or indirectli affected.Gov . Jerri Brown , announc detail of the propos legisl at a news confer on Monday , acknowledg the potenti hardship of give California the highest minimum wage of ani state in the countri .If you took the wage down and cut them in half , it would make it easier for certain busi ,  he said . But you cant function that way , becaus wer a community.Mr. Brown , who work out the deal with top legisl and labor leader , said the risk were worth it . It a matter of econom justic ,  he said , and it make sense.The legisl would delay by one year the schedul of wage increas for busi with 25 worker or fewer , and would allow the governor to paus an increas for one year if the economi weaken or the state budget deterior .Craig Scharton , the owner of a farm-to-t restaur call Peeve Public Hous in downtown Fresno , said he wa still smart from a recent increas in the minimum wage from $ 9 to $ 10 an hour . He said the increas had forc him to close on Monday and Tuesday and play a role in reduc hi staf to a dozen today from 18 two and a half year ago .Mr. Scharton wa at a loss to explain how he would absorb the new increas . Wer tri our best to revit downtown ,  he said . Thi just kind of kick our leg out from under us.The Fresno exampl illustr the challeng of rais the minimum wage to the same level across citi that , in econom term , have littl in common beyond the same state govern . Citi with high real estat price are typic better abl to withstand minimum wage increas than citi with low price , becaus wage repres a smaller fraction of a business overal cost in those citi and therefor have a smaller effect on the bottom line .But in Fresno , real estat is cheap and wage are by far the biggest cost for the typic servic sector busi . Mr. Scharton estim that labor is about 40 percent of hi cost , versu about 6 percent for real estat .Likewis , busi in citi with larg tourist industri often find it easier to pass along higher cost to custom , as tourist tend to be less price-sensit than local . But Fresno , unlik Lo Angel or San Francisco , is not a tourist hub .I dont think we have anyth over $ 14 for an entre ,  he said . We cant do $ 32 an entre like some high-end fanci New York restaurant.The advers effect from a sharp increas in the minimum wage may not be as sever as some oppon fear , howev . Michael Reich , an econom professor at the Univers of California , Berkeley  whose work polici maker in Lo Angel and New York State have reli on to analyz their recent effort to rais the minimum wage  said that , in hi model , the overal econom effect of a $ 15 minimum wage wa roughli neutral , even when it amount to 60 percent of the median wage .The reason , he said , is that the neg econom consequ of a higher wage  name , lower employ , partli becaus of greater autom , and declin sale becaus of price increas  were offset by greater purchas power on the part of worker , which would lift econom activ in an area .As for low-cost citi where the impact could be even larger , Mr. Reich said low-wag worker in place like Fresno were not so differ paid from low-wag worker in higher-cost citi  despit the fact that typic wage in those citi are far apart .Even if the averag wage differenti between Fresno and the rest of the state is about 25 percent ,  Mr. Reich said , just within retail and restaur you find that the wage differenti is more like 5 percent.Moreov , the benefit of the higher wage may be more than pure econom .Dave Regan is presid of SEIU-Unit Healthcar Worker West , which repres more than 85,000 hospit worker in California and deploy more than 2,500 member to collect hundr of thousand of signatur to qualifi a minimum wage ballot initi . He said that even if there were potenti econom downsid , the effect of empow worker to influenc their own fate could be transform polit .There so much cynic , anger ,  Mr. Regan said . To have the governor and legislatur respond in a posit and construct way to our member is realli import . It show , Wow , what we do realli doe matter.Citi in other state , like Seattl and Chicago , recent enact signific wage increas , and Gov . Andrew M. Cuomo of New York is press a plan to increas the minimum wage to $ 15 in New York Citi by 2019 and statewid by 2021 .Skeptic argu that the California polici is reckless , given that there were alreadi a varieti of local experi underway that would have given insight into the effect of a substanti minimum wage increas befor thrust the country most popul state into unknown territori .We just pass minimum wage law in some citi : San Francisco is a high-wag one , Lo Angel is not such a high-wag one ,  said David Neumark , an econom professor at the Univers of California , Irvin , who ha done work suggest that even rel moder minimum wage increas can lead to a more than trivial rise in unemploy .

The compani ha held at least one seat on the company board sinc 2007 , and more recent held two seat . It help instal Valeant now-dethron chief execut , J. Michael Pearson . It oversaw the design of the company compens polici that some critic now suggest creat incent to use aggress account practic . It also back Valeant controversi strategi to cut research and develop and to significantli increas the price of it drug .For year , Valeant success wa ValueAct success . It wa a home run . At one point last summer , when Valeant stock wa trade at $ 250 a share , ValueAct return on it stake wa a whop 2,100 percent . And it wa proud of Valeant deal-driven , slash-and-burn strategi : We believ extraordinari valu could be creat not from a tradit strategi of high-risk R & D ; bet but rather from a focu on oper excel , cost control and asset divestitur ,  ValueAct said in glow support of the compani back in 2009 .But that wa then .Today , Valeant share are down about 88 percent from their high of last summer in the face of question about the company account , the ouster of Mr. Pearson and a scuffl insid the boardroom that led to a director be ask to resign , a request the director refus . Oh , and the compani is be investig by Congress and the Secur and Exchang Commiss .ValueAct , amazingli , is still in the black , have bought much of it stake in Valeant at an averag share price of $ 11 .Last June , ValueAct sold about $ 1 billion worth of Valeant share onli month befor the company troubl surfac . Under secur law , insid are held to a veri strict polici about when they can sell sinc they are privi to the company intern record and plan . No one ha accus ValueAct of sell it share with knowledg of the company impend downfal , and there is no reason to believ that wa the case .ValueAct describ the sale of share last summer as a standard portfolio transaction.W have own Valeant share for over nine year and have sold share on three previou occas for the same portfolio manag purpos ,  it said in a statement at the time . After thi sale , our invest in Valeant will continu to be well in excess of $ 3 billion and will be one of the largest invest in our funds.But ValueAct , given it presenc on the board and long relationship with Valeant , had to be awar of the company use of a mail-ord pharmaci , Philidor , as a way around the effort of pharmaci and insur compani to sell lower-pr gener drug instead of Valeant high-pric brand-nam drug . That practic ha come under scrutini and led , in larg part , to Valeant current crisi .Valeant declin to make Mr. Ubben avail to comment . In fair to him , he is at a disadvantag as far as defend himself publicli becaus most compani lawyer prevent insid from speak out .It is hard to see how ValueAct wouldnt have been awar of some of Valeant more aggress strategi , unless it intend to claim that it wa dupe by manag , a claim it ha yet to make . Inde , even though ValueAct repres , Mason Morfit , had step down from the board ( befor return after the crisi hit ) , Mr. Pearson said in a statement last fall : Although Mason ha not offici been a part of the Valeant Board for more than a year , I have continu to valu hi vision and guidanc , and I believ hi insight will be invalu dure thi time.It wa Mr. Morfit , among other on the board , who help put in place a compens plan for Mr. Pearson and other manag that some govern expert say may have led to Valeant aggress approach , both with it use of Philidor and with it account practic , which have now come under scrutini .Mr. Pearson compens plan , onc herald as a model for pay for perform , wa tie directli to the success of the company stock price . Mr. Pearson need to reach certain threshold of perform to be paid or he would get noth beyond hi salari . And last year , Mr. Pearson salari wa slash to zero to make him even more depend on the perform model , so he wa complet focus on hi incent bonu .The stock need to go up at least 15 percent annual over at least three year for hi bonu share to vest . If the stock went up 45 percent , Mr. Pearson would be paid three time as much . By last summer , Mr. Pearson wa worth about $ 3 billion on paper .We richli reward for outstand T.S.R . perform ,  the compani said in a file , refer to total sharehold return , but pay significantli less for below-averag T.S.R . performance. It acknowledg that it formula meant the company execut could be among the best-paid in the industry.That might have sound good in theori . Who doesnt want their executives pay directli tie to the company perform ? Unlik those in so mani compani , Valeant compens structur meant that Mr. Pearson would do well onli if the sharehold did too . None of the head you win , tail you win too chicaneri that ha led to such skeptic about compens at public compani .But it meant that Mr. Pearson and hi team need the stock to keep go up . And that may have led to a cultur that wa too aggress .All along , ValueAct wa there . The firm manag may not have been oper the compani day to day , nor make some of the decis that led to the current crisi of confid . But it happen on their watch , under a chief execut they champion . At a minimum , ValueAct tacitli endors Valeant strategi . And now , ValueAct is stuck hold the share , unabl to sell them given it insid statu and all the continu investig .While ValueAct investor may still look at Valeant as a profit trade , they might want to give the compani the kind of scrutini ValueAct fail to give Valeant .', 'A feder judg in San Juan on Monday threw out a new tax that Puerto Rico had tri to impos on the American retail giant Walmart , call it unlaw .Walmart had argu that the new tax would confisc more than 100 percent of it profit from oper in Puerto Rico , make it one of the most oner tax on earth .The judg , Jos Antonio Fust of the Unit State District Court in Puerto Rico , said in hi opinion on Monday that it gave him no pleasur to throw out the tax , consid the commonwealth dire financi condit .

Offici were still analyz the lengthi opinion , he said , but would appeal soon . We will rais on appeal all the procedur error that , in our opinion , took place dure the trial ,  he said .The disput began in 2015 , when Puerto Rico amend it altern minimum tax for compani . That type of tax tri to catch those who might otherwis use loophol to avoid pay what they owe . Compani calcul their tax each way , then pay the higher amount .The tax chang includ a big increas in the rate for compani oper big-box store on the island . Walmart said in it lawsuit that the highest new rate wa reserv for busi on the island with revenu of more than $ 2.75 billion , and the onli compani that met that descript wa Walmart .Puerto Rico ha had troubl balanc it budget everi year for at least a decad . It accumul a $ 72 billion debt , in part , by issu long-term bond just to get the cash to balanc it budget , a practic wide consid unsustain . At the time the legislatur wa amend the altern minimum tax , it wa tri to plug a $ 125 million budget hole .Walmart also cite evid that Puerto Rican lawmak had sought to rais it tax high enough to pay for other busi on the island to get a tax reduct . Walmart argu that thi violat it right under the Equal Protect Claus of the Unit State Constitut , and Judg Fust agre .Puerto Rican offici said the tax chang were appropri becaus big compani like Walmart , with branch all over the world , let their supplier branch sell good to their retail branch at artifici inflat price . That made the retail outlet look as if they had littl or no profit , and therefor had to pay littl or no incom tax .They also said the case did not belong in feder court . The right procedur , they said , wa for Walmart to pay it tax , appli for a refund and then , when that wa deni , bring suit in a Puerto Rican court .That is true , so long as the tax-refund procedur will afford Walmart Puerto Rico a plain , speedi and effici remedi ,  Judg Fust said .He then describ at length the way Puerto Rico ha been kite check ,  shift money from one creditor to pay anoth and warehousing money in a vault to claim that it had made payment without deduct the fund from it book .The govern ha been cannib itself at an astonish rate ,  the judg said . He conclud that if Walmart paid the tax on demand , it would be send the money to an insolv govern that would never pay it back .', 'Pandora Media becam a powerhous in onlin music primarili by do one thing : tailor song after song to the tast of it listen , along with the occasion ad .

And a channel-stuf compani may also book revenu by transfer good to an entiti that is not total separ .In explain it recent revenu restat , for instanc , Valeant said it should not have book some sale when it transfer product to a distributor call Philidor Rx Servic , whose murki tie to Valeant were examin by the Southern Investig Report Foundat , which report on financi issu .But even befor the Philidor revel , larg and sudden increas in sale of certain product rais suspicion about channel-stuf .In the middl of 2014 , for instanc , Valeant post larg increas in sale for some product sold by Bausch & Lomb , the eye-car compani that Valeant bought in 2013 . Critic at the time wonder whether Valeant want to highlight strong gain at Bausch & Lomb becaus it acquisit strategi wa come under attack by Allergan , which wa fierc resist an acquisit attempt by Valeant . In the fourth quarter of 2014 , the sale gain in some Bausch & Lomb product were lower .One warn sign wa that Valeant profit were unimpress under gener accept account principl , the standard bookkeep that all public compani must use . Instead , it emphas earn measur that left out hundr of million of dollar of cost , includ expens relat to integr it acquisit .When such acquisit cost are consist high , investor may worri that cost relat to a company regular oper are somehow be includ in the acquisit expens to make oper earn look stronger than they are .Perhap in recognit of investors concern about the high level of acquisit integr cost , Valeant told investor in Juli 2014 that such expens would be below $ 70 million in the third quarter of 2014 , roughli half the $ 143 million record for such expens in the second quarter of 2014 . They did fall below $ 70 million , come in at $ 63 million . But a Valeant file later indic that the target wa met by chang where $ 20 million of restructur expens were book in the incom statement .Ms. Littl of Valeant said in an email that these expens , which relat to stock option , were more appropri classified in a differ part of the incom statement , and the compani ha kept them there sinc .A heavi acquisit strategi can also gener concern about a practic known as spring-load . When one compani acquir anoth , there is usual period of sever week between the announc of the deal and the actual date at which the acquir compani becom part of the acquir . In that interim , the acquir may find a way to book a higher level of cost and lower revenu at the compani be acquir .Thi process , which take place befor the acquir company financi statement merg with those of the acquir , is intend to suppress the profit of the firm be bought , sole for the interim period . Onc part of the acquir , the cost and revenu of the acquir firm return to more normal level , enabl it profit to surg onc it can benefit the bottom line of the acquir .Valeant skeptic wonder whether thi happen with Bausch & Lomb . In a special proxi file , Valeant includ an incom statement for Bausch & Lomb for the period between the end of the second quarter of 2013 , Bausch & Lomb last full quarter as an independ firm , and Aug. 4 , 2013 , the day befor Valeant acquir Bausch & Lomb .In the interim , Bausch & Lomb revenu , express on a per-day basi to make it compar , wa 16 percent lower than in the first half of 2013 , and then from Aug. 4 , 2013 , until Sept. 30 , 2013 , revenu surg to a per-day level that wa higher than in the interim and in the first half of that year . Also , some cost rose , on a per-day basi , in the interim from the first half of 2013 .For most of it growth period , Valeant ha been led by J. Michael Pearson , who is now leav , and Howard B. Schiller , the former chief financi offic . Valeant board ha ask Mr. Schiller to resign , but he ha not done so . He said in a statement last week that he did not do anyth improp in relat to the plan earn restat . And he ad in the statement that he wa told that Valeant extern auditor had review certain transact with Philidor .The auditor , PricewaterhouseCoop , or PwC , will now play an even more crucial role in determin Valeant stand . After miss a deadlin for file it annual report for 2015 , Valeant said it wa work to get the report out by April 29 . PwC , howev , may take more time to sign off on the financi statement , caus Valeant to miss it new project file date .Regul may now also take a close look at Valeant account .

By and larg , Theranos measur agre with those of the other lab , and cost much less . Still , the studi is almost certain to rais more doubt about the company assert that it had found a way to revolution medic test .On Thursday , Therano sent a letter to the journal , hope to stop it from publish the paper . The letter , sign by Theranos laboratori director , call the studi flaw and inaccurate and ad , We are disappoint that ani journal would accept thi studi for publication.Therano ha attract huge attent for say that it could perform numer blood test at veri low cost use a few drop of blood from a finger rather than the usual tube of blood drawn from a vein in the arm . The news media swoon over Elizabeth Holm , who drop out of Stanford to start Therano and now , at age 32 , is a billionair on paper .But articl in The Wall Street Journal and regulatori action have challeng the company claim . Feder regul in Januari cite Therano for sever defici , includ one that pose immedi jeopardi to patient health and safety.Therano is no longer do much finger-prick test , pend regulatori approv .The new studi , by research at the Icahn School of Medicin at Mount Sinai , wa conduct for the most part last Juli , befor the question about Therano aros .The studi involv 60 healthi adult volunt , each of whom wa test twice in the same day at two separ walk-in Therano site in the Phoenix area .For Quest and LabCorp , the volunt had blood drawn from their arm immedi befor the first Therano visit and again immedi after the second one .They were test for 22 measur , includ variou type of cholesterol and a complet blood count . The test did not includ one for the clot abil of blood , the one Therano execut say regul cite as pose a threat to patient .While most of the result were similar for the three lab , 12.2 percent of the measur report by Therano were outsid the expect normal rang for healthi peopl , compar with 7.5 percent for Quest and 8.3 percent for LabCorp .Therano wa out of rang more often for lymphocyt , which are type of white blood cell ; for a measur of hemoglobin ; and for certain type of cholesterol . But Quest and LabCorp also differ from each other in some instanc .There actual pretti widespread variabl in these clinic measur , even between the refer lab ,  said Eric Schadt , chairman of genet and genom scienc at the Icahn School and an author of the report . But Therano wa more outsid of rang and outsid of rang in way that would impact clinic decision-making.In their letter to the journal and in an interview , Therano execut said that just becaus a result wa out of the normal rang did not mean it wa wrong . There wa no attempt made by the study author to determin which measur wa correct .For instanc , for LDL cholesterol , both Therano and LabCorp report result out of the normal rang for mani of the same peopl , while Quest report normal level for them .Therano execut also said that take a big draw of blood from a vein immedi befor a finger prick wa not standard practic . They said that affect the finger prick sampl in a way that made it difficult to return a read .Still , some expert not involv in the studi said it wa done reason well .Thi repres just anoth effort for a fail compani to cover up bad press for a technolog that is not readi for prime time ,  Dr. Frederick L. Kiechl , medic director for clinic patholog at Memori Healthcar System in Hollywood , Fla. , said about Theranos letter to the journal .Dr. Kiechl said it wa known that cell in blood tend to clump togeth and travel in group ,  so the tini amount collect from a finger prick might not be repres .Greg Miller , professor of patholog and director of clinic chemistri at Virginia Commonwealth Univers , said the discrep in cholesterol result were medic meaningful and suggest that Therano had not properli calibr it test to an industri standard .Dr. Schadt said the studi wa done becaus hi genet group want to see whether Therano test could be use as a low-cost way to period monitor the health of peopl . Therano charg onli $ 33 for the 22 measur , about a fifth the cost at the two other lab .The research did not tell Therano about the studi , want it to be a real world test of the servic .In Decemb , howev , Dr. Schadt tri to contact a Therano execut through LinkedIn to ask some question . He said he got no repli . Therano say it ha no record of be contact .Therano ha been critic for not publish data on it own in peer-review journal . A spokeswoman said there would be such public in the come month .Dr. Schadt said he wa surpris that hi group of genet research , rather than the compani or laboratori scientist , wa the first to publish such a studi .You would have thought that it wouldnt be left to group like mine to flesh that out ,  he said .', 'SHANGHAI  The new $ 1.3 billion Cadillac factori on the outskirt of Shanghai is a shrine to modern manufactur , the kind of facil that automak all over the world dream of build but can seldom afford .Hundr of robot bend , arch and twist to assembl the bodi of Cadillac new flagship CT6 .

That is almost equal to the American and European market combin , and greater than even the most optimist forecast : that sale in China will reach about 25 million next year .Automak are expand at a time when China econom growth ha slow to it lowest level in more than a quarter-centuri .

The main beneficiari have been domest Chines automak , mostli affili with municip or provinci govern , that churn out cheap subcompact with small engin .A similar tax reduct produc strong sale in 2009 and 2010 . But it mainli encourag consum to buy sooner . When the tax cut expir , sale essenti level off for the next two year .With the current tax reduct schedul to end , 2017 will be a veri difficult year for the auto industri , probabl no growth ,  said Yale Zhang , the manag director of Automot Foresight , a Shanghai consult firm .Multin are focus more on higher-profit segment that are grow without help from such incent . But they are also finish up a factory-build spree that start three year ago , when the economi wa healthier .We see China move to a pace of what I would call moder growth ,  said Matthew Tsien , the G.M . execut vice presid who overse the company China busi .Volkswagen forecast that China auto market will grow slightli faster than the overal economi thi year and slightli slower than the overal economi for the rest of the decad . G.M . is forecast that the market will grow a littl less than 5 percent a year through the end of the decad , the equival of ad the entir auto market of Japan , or five Australia .Both automak are plan to meet much of that growth with factori they have alreadi commiss or will soon finish .

Most of the multin are go to get real and slow down the new capac ,  said Bill Russo , former chief execut of Chrysler China and now a consult . Im not sure about the local manufactur .

But if we instead take respons for riski invest or listen to the latest profess market seer , for not stick to our financi plan or for ani other number of thing , we have a much better opportun to minim the chanc of bad thing happen to us in the futur .What realli power about thi practic is that even when I know Im not to blame for my situat , I still find it help . It sound realli heavi , alway take respons . But Iv found the opposit to be true . It feel enlighten and not heavier at all , like a burden ha been lift from my shoulder . It allow me to let go of feel helpless and empow me to come up with creativ way to improv my situat .Thi idea remind me of a quot from Leo Tolstoy , Everyon think about chang the world , but no one think of chang himself. In the end , that the onli thing you have control over : yourself !Even if you could bend Goldman Sach over your knee and give it a spank when it mess up a market forecast , odd are that you wouldnt get the firm to chang it behavior . What you can do is take respons for how you react to that forecast . In the futur , you can make a plan for how to handl the risk , then stick to it .Think of thi not as an indict but as an invit . Im not here to lay blame on you ; Im here to encourag you to take at least some of the respons when thing go wrong and then learn from your mistak . Ultim , I think youll find that do so will be more empow and more product than blame someon els .', 'A 39-year-old Wall Street execut , Andrew Caspersen came from a life of privileg and opportun : Groton , Princeton and then Harvard Law School , where the student center is name after hi famili becaus of a gener gift from hi father .But the father had a secret that emerg onli after he commit suicid in 2009 : Finn M.W .

Irv Place Capit wa origin a privat equiti fund of Bear Stearn , the Wall Street firm that implod in 2008 .Mr. Caspersen , who previous work for Coller Capit , a fund that buy privat equiti fund asset , never told prospect investor the shell compani wa control complet by him , the author said .

The question may well devolv into whether Valeant can surviv everyth be thrown at it .Last week , it remov it chief execut , J. Michael Pearson , and appoint William A. Ackman , who is the company second-largest sharehold through hi hedg fund firm , Persh Squar Capit Manag , as the newest director .These chang come after the compani disclos in late Februari that it wa be investig by the Secur and Exchang Commiss over potenti account problem relat to it relationship with the mail-ord pharmaci Philidor Rx Servic , which it control . Valeant disclos in a secur file that the restat involv some $ 58 million in revenu that wa improperli includ in it 2014 financi statement .For a compani report billion of dollar in sale , that amount to hardli more than a drop in the bucket . But as the S.E.C . ha learn over the year , account problem are rare limit to a singl transact , so it can be expect to undertak a thorough review of Valeant financi statement to see whether there are more question entri in the corpor book .The compani sought to portray itself to the regul as cooper by accus it former chief financi offic , Howard B. Schiller , and former corpor control of engag in improp conduct that led to incorrect inform be given to Valeant director and outsid auditor . Thi reflect a recent push by regul and prosecutor to get compani to disclos who is respons for misconduct , rather than just take the blame at the corpor level while individu avoid liabil .Valeant finger-point drew a quick respons from Mr. Schiller . He issu a statement through hi lawyer assert that at no time did I engag in ani improp conduct that relat to ani restat of revenu the compani is considering.More import for Valeant , Mr. Schiller ha refus to relinquish hi posit on the company board , which give him a front-row seat to observ how it respond to the investig . As Steven Davidoff Solomon , the Deal Professor , ha point out , Valeant ha few option to remov Mr. Schiller befor it next annual meet , which mean he could be around for anoth coupl of month .Under the company articl of incorpor , it also must foot the bill for Mr. Schiller lawyer relat to ani investig or proceed . That could result in further litig if Valeant decid to fight him by not pay those cost , someth compani have been known to do when they believ a former execut wa the caus of the problem .Whether Mr. Schiller might be will to cooper with the account investig rais an interest question . The secur law govern corpor account can be pursu both in civil and crimin proceed , so the potenti for a prosecut ha to be consid in ani respons to the S.E.C .It would not be surpris if prosecutor were look over the agency shoulder to see whether the case might develop into a crimin prosecut , so Mr. Schiller lawyer will need to be care about disclos inform that may implic him in ani misconduct .As the Justic Depart learn when pursu account fraud case at compani like Enron and WorldCom year ago , a cooper chief financi offic can be a gold mine of inform becaus that is often the person who know where the financi bodi are buri . So Mr. Schiller is like to be a key player as the investig of Valeant account unfold .The Justic Depart is also look at Valeant drug price practic , with The New York Time report that grand juri subpoena were issu by feder prosecutor in Massachusett and Manhattan last year . The Unit State attorney offic in Boston ha brought a number of promin health care fraud case , includ a settlement in Octob with Millennium Laboratori that result in a $ 256 million payment , while the offic in Manhattan is well known for it aggress approach to white-collar crime investig .Ad to Valeant talli sheet of investig is anoth Justic Depart inquiri into the company Bausch & Lomb unit for possibl health care fraud relat to surgic product . There is also an S.E.C . investig into statement made by Salix Pharmaceut in 2014 about it inventori level , a year befor Valeant acquir it .As if that werent enough , there are a number of privat secur fraud lawsuit file against the compani and it director for the drop in it stock price . The suit claim the compani fail to properli disclos develop in it oper and the account problem it ha identifi . These type of case are typic whenev a compani undergo a signific declin in valu , especi if it disclos ani misconduct , and will requir Valeant to pay more for lawyer to fight them .Anoth lawsuit that continu to bedevil Valeant and Mr. Ackman is one claim that they engag in insid trade when Persh Squar bought a larg stake in Allergan befor Valeant tender offer for the compani in 2014 . The case wa brought by contemporan traders who sold their share as Persh Squar wa accumul a 9.7 percent stake in Allergan to support Valeant attempt to acquir the compani , lose out on the premium price when the offer wa announc and Allergan stock shot up .Reuter report that a feder judg reject a defens motion to dismiss the case last Novemb , allow it to move forward with discoveri . Both Mr. Ackman and Valeant senior manag are sure to be subject to deposit along with have to produc a larg volum of document , further drive up the legal fee they will have to pay .Mr. Ackman presenc on Valeant board could caus him a problem if he want to sell down hi stake in the compani  or perhap even increas it , unlik as that might seem at the moment . He will receiv a sheaf of materi nonpubl inform about the company oper and plan for tri to rebuild itself , or seek to buyer for some or all of the busi it acquir over the last few year .In a letter to the compani date March 22 , Mr. Ackman agre that he and Persh Squar employe would maintain the confidenti of Valeant inform and refrain from ani trade that might violat Unit State or Canadian secur law  the compani is charter in British Columbia . Although the letter state that hi hedg fund will refrain from trade onli dure blackout period impos on all director and employe befor the disclosur of import inform , ani trade by Mr. Ackman is sure to draw scrutini , and perhap a lawsuit , becaus of the possibl that he wa privi to materi nonpubl inform .That could effect lock Persh Squar into it invest in Valeant until Mr. Ackman leav the board , negoti a sale or come up with some other exit strategi . As of the date of hi letter to Valeant , Persh Squar report a year-to-d loss of 25.2 percent , accord to The New York Time , so investor may not be patient wait for the turnaround of an invest that the firm can not unload .The torrent of investig is sure to be a distract for Valeant manag and board , includ Mr. Ackman .

In those day , you didnt have the Internet , so track down compani wasnt easi .There were plenti of failur , but Iv alway been a veri posit person , and tri to see the silver line . Onc I rememb we order Dr. Marten ladies platform shoe in 36-40 , and got size 42-46 . There wa noth we could do , but then men start to buy those . Anoth time , we order T-shirt that came in a children size . Luckili the trend for super-tight T-shirt wa start , so we told the young girl that wa the way to wear it .Q. Youv been a strong propon of social entrepreneurship . Whi ?A . When we first made our first $ 50,000 cash , my sister and I were wonder what to spend it on . Then we heard our pastor say he want to rais $ 50,000 to build six small church in Gujarat ( India ) . We hesit a bit but decid to give him the money . A year and a half later , we learn there had been a big earthquak there , but the six church had not collaps and had becom the help center for the victim . At that point it hit me that God had a plan for us and that if we were abl to provid for peopl in need we should . So our mission of do busi and do well is realli to provid for other .Today , we still give to our church , but we also put asid money to help as much as we can directli . We have built seven church in China , we support a home for the elderli , an entir villag in Indonesia , and a children home for 100 kid in Myanmar . Start new busi is realli about sustain what I want to do . You should make money for a purpos .Q . How would you defin social entrepreneurship ?A. It about use a busi model to help solv social issu . I do believ you can do well , make money and do good at the same time . With social entrepreneurship you can integr into your staff disabl peopl , ex-offend , singl mother , pay them a fair wage ; but it not a token hire . It built into the busi model .One great exampl is Dialog in the Dark , by Andrea Heineck . It offer the experi of daili life in pitch dark . You have a blind guid who becom the one who is able and you are disabled. You need him to take you through daili life , go to the market , cross the road . You pay for the experi , which is a veri impact one , and it help provid job for the blind . There are a lot of differ model .Q . What kind of social enterpris have you start ?A . Eight year ago , I approach Vivoc ( a Singapor shop mall ) and ask them to give me space where I could help disadvantag peopl who make handicraft sell their work dure the first and last weekend of the month  becaus in Singapor , that payday and peopl are more like to be will to part with money to buy a littl someth . I think we all need a space where we can buy , sell and trade .I think that everi shop mall in the world should have thi marketplac concept , mayb just two day a month , and allow the margin and artisan to showcas and sell their product .More recent I invest into an app call FastFast Deliveri . It like an Uber for courier servic . I got the idea becaus I sit on mani board , and they need me to sign lot of document . My staff is alway track me down , and I thought , wouldnt it be nice to just have those paper deliv wherev I am that day , and give an opportun to peopl who are current unemploy or mayb retir and need a bit more cash ? So I found someon , my co-found , who could creat the platform , and sinc we launch last August , wev had about 900 driver who sign up . I set it up think thi would primarili be use by individu like myself , but what wev found is that our top client are actual hotel concierg and small busi , like florist , cooki shop that just want someth deliv immedi .Q . What advic would you give to a young social entrepreneur ?A. I think today young peopl do have a heart and want to do good , but if you want to succeed that not enough . You also need to think through your financi model . So my advic : Befor launch yourself into a busi , get some experi , do volunt work . Mani youngster today have been rais on handout from their parent and they need to build some inner core strength . They cant take stress , becaus theyv never realli experienc hardship , theyv never experienc failur ; their parent have alway been there to help . To build a muscl you need to train it regularli ; it the same in busi . You will have issu come your way everi day , and that someth you need to learn to deal with so it doesnt becom stress .What you learn earli on will be valuabl lesson . My grandpar own a dispensari clinic and I wa alway there , do magic to entertain peopl wait . In primari Grade 4 , I start resel 3-D card for someon els at school . Id make about 20-30 percent on each card and I learn to save that money , and then give it away . I think it good to let children experi how to make money from an earli age and encourag them to give back .Q . You play a role as a mentor to mani youngster . Did you have a good mentor yourself ?A . Along my journey Iv had differ mentor , busi mentor and spiritu , but the greatest mentor Iv ever had ha been my mom . She alway bring me back to ground . She ha never been the one who say , Go for it at all cost. A coupl of year ago , I wa work on a big project , I realli pour my heart and soul into it and I got play by my partner . I thought about go to court , and then my mom told me , Let it go , you dont need it . Even if you win , it go to eat you up and Im just go to lose you as a daughter. As an entrepreneur I want to fight for it , but in the end I let it go .', 'SYDNEY , Australia  Ben Gray , the co-head of TPG Capit in Asia , will leav the American privat equiti firm amid report that he is set up hi own Australia-focus invest firm .Mr. Gray departur from TPG , set for the end of thi year , will leav Timothi Dattel , a former Goldman Sach partner , as sole head of TPG in Asia .TPG said it had hire Joel Thickin as it new countri head of Australia .

The merger will creat a power new forc in the industri that will dramat reshap the futur of how peopl gain access to the Internet , watch televisionand much more .Emili Steel , who cover media for The New York Time , and Cecilia Kang , who write for The Time from Washington about technolog polici , have been follow the stori sinc it broke in the summer of 2013 .EMILi STEEL : Hi , Cecilia . It hard to believ that thi day is final come . What the latest that your hear from regul in Washington on the Charter deal ?CECILIA KANG : Hello from the seat of govern , where corpor come to win heart at the risk of get their broken . In thi case , it look as if Charter , a small cabl compani with big ambit , will find rare success . The Feder Commun Commiss shot down two big merger in the last five year but is about to approv Charter bid for Time Warner Cabl and Bright Hous . The acquisit will creat the second-largest broadband provid , after Comcast , with 19.4 million subscrib , and the third-largest video provid , after Comcast and DirecTV , with 17.3 million custom . The combin compani will span 40 state and includ big market such as Lo Angel and New York .The creation of such a giant cabl and Internet compani upset consum advocaci group , which say a lack of competit ha led to increas price and poor custom servic . But the F.C.C . think the deal wont harm consum becaus the compani dont realli compet in the same market . While Comcast made a similar argument in it fail bid for Time Warner Cabl , the F.C.C . wa more skeptic in that case becaus Comcast big media hold with NBCUnivers held the potenti for a conflict of interest .Charter and Time Warner Cabl have also persuad regul that togeth , theyll be abl to bring faster broadband to more household .The big focu at the F.C.C . ha been on how thi deal will affect the fastest-grow area of media : video stream . Emili , what do peopl in the media and tech industri think ?EMILi STEEL : Stream ha definit been a hot topic . The big fear is that a gigant Charter will have both the power and the incent to hurt rival stream servic . It also could hinder the invent of other new offer .In the three year sinc Charter start circl Time Warner Cabl , there ha been an explos of new option for cord cutter , who want to ditch their tradit cabl subscript but keep feed their TV addict . HBO and Showtim , for exampl , both start  la cart stream servic . And Dish Network start a servic call Sling TV that offer live and on-demand view for about two dozen channel . Those new servic are usual cheaper than a typic cabl TV offer ( like what Charter sell ) and also give peopl more choic to pay for what they want to watch , when they want to watch it . ( I tri out Sling to watch my North Carolina Tar Heel in the March Mad colleg basketbal tournament thi year . )If Charter is sell tradit cabl servic , whi would it want to eas the way for a new set of competitor ? Both Dish and Time Warner , the parent compani of HBO , have warn regul that Charter takeov could alter the futur of stream .How do you expect regul to address that concern ?CECILIA KANG : As a condit of approv , the F.C.C . persuad Charter to agre to a number of public interest commit , includ a promis that it will treat stream servic fairli . It possibl that Charter will promis not to pressur programm like Viacom and Disney to withhold show from compani like Hulu and Netflix , which could siphon viewer away from Charter offer . Arrang to withhold program , known as most favor nation claus , are common but secret . But the F.C.C . and Depart of Justic , which is also review the deal , have made more nois about them in variou speech becaus they think such deal stifl stream servic by keep the most popular show exclus in the cabl bundl .Tom Wheeler , chairman of the F.C.C. , ha talk a lot about hi mission to ensur that nascent media and telecom servic blossom dure hi tenur . After the agenc reject Comcast bid for Time Warner Cabl last April , the F.C.C. top lawyer said that particular deal would have threaten stream compani that compet with Comcast video servic .Which rais a question : Whi would regul say ye to Charter but no to Comcast ?EMILi STEEL : For one , thi deal is not as big . The Comcast-Tim Warner Cabl merger would have unit the country two largest cabl compani into an entiti that control as much as 57 percent of the nation broadband market and just under 30 percent of pay televis . That would have put a lot of power in the hand of one compani that sever TV execut alreadi describ as a major bulli . And while Charter deal ha gener it share of critic , the opposit to the Comcast deal wa much louder and came from a wider base of lawmak , public interest group and big compani like Netflix , Dish and Discoveri Commun .Comcast lash out against it critic , call some extortionist . Charter , on the other hand , ha taken a more conciliatori approach , strike deal with potenti oppon , like one in which it promis not to charg access fee to onlin content compani such as Netflix no matter how much traffic they creat . ( Charter ha a major financi incent to make the concess necessari for approv : Time Warner Cabl will receiv a breakup fee of up to $ 2 billion if the deal fall apart . )One other interest point , I think , is the idea that regul could be use the Charter deal to drive the industri to adopt new busi model . Cecilia , what do you think the F.C.C . is hope to achiev through the merger ?CECILIA KANG : Thi F.C.C . clearli want to support stream video servic , and that push is seen in so mani of it regulatori decis . It net neutral rule  a condit of thi deal that will be upheld even if the agency rule are overturn in feder court  would ensur that Netflix and Hulu are never slow or block by Charter . The F.C.C . hope that open up the set-top-box market will allow compani like Googl and Amazon to sell devic that blend cabl program with Hulu , YouTub and onlin video servic .Merger are also use to spur broadband provid to extend servic to more custom and offer cheaper plan for low-incom household , a provis Charter ha alreadi volunt to adopt . Other commit could includ the promis not to impos data cap or usage-bas price for broadband custom .And even if the deal gain approv from feder regul , it ha one more hurdl : Regul in California are also review the merger . But there is littl indic it will be block by state commission .The complet of one merger is near , Emili , but Im sure anoth big cabl , wireless or media merger will have us back here talk again veri soon . Until then .', 'SAN FRANCISCO  As the oracl of Silicon Valley debat whether the latest tech boom is slide toward bust , there is alreadi talk about what will drive the industry next growth spurt .The way we use comput is chang , toward a boom ( and , if histori is ani guid , a bubbl ) in collect ocean of data in so-cal cloud comput center , then analyz the inform to build new busi .The term most often associ with thi are machin learning and artifici intellig ,  or A.I. And the creation spawn by thi market could affect thing rang from globe-span comput system to how you pay at the cafeteria .There is go to be a boom for design compani , becaus there go to be so much inform peopl have to work through quickli ,  said Dian B. Green , the head of Googl Comput Engin , one of the compani hope to steer an A.I . boom . Just teach compani how to use A.I . will be a big business.Thi kind of chang is what keep Silicon Valley go . When person comput displac mainfram comput , it open the door not just for Appl , but for compani make PC softwar for busi , game and publish . In the network and Internet revolut , ventur capitalist invest in these new comput style , and anoth gener of compani wa born .Over the last decad , smartphon , social network and cloud comput have move from feed the growth of compani like Facebook and Twitter , leapfrog to Uber , Airbnb and other that have use the phone , person rate system and power remot comput in the cloud to creat their own new busi .Believ it or not , that stuff may be head for the rearview mirror alreadi . The tech industry new architectur is base not just on the giant public comput cloud of Googl , Microsoft and Amazon , but also on their A.I . capabl . These cloud creat more effici and suppl use of comput resourc , avail for rent . Smaller cloud use in corpor system are design to connect to them .The A.I . resourc Ms. Green is open up at Googl are remark . Google autocomplet featur that most of us use when do a search can instantan touch 500 comput in sever locat as it guess what we are look for . Servic like Map and Photo have over a billion user , sort place and face by comput . Gmail sift through 1.4 petabyt of data , or roughli two billion books worth of inform , everi day .Handl all that , plu task like languag translat and speech recognit , Googl ha amass a wealth of analysi technolog that it can offer to custom . Ur Hlzle , Ms. Greene chief of technic infrastructur , predict that the busi of rent out machin and softwar will eventu surpass Googl advertis . In 2015 , ad profit were $ 16.4 billion .In the 80 , it wa spreadsheet ,  said Andrea Bechtolsheim , a note comput design expert who wa Google first investor . Now it what you can do with machin learning.He ad : Better map and photo is just the start . It go to be in life scienc , automobil , everything.A number of start-up are alreadi aim at the new architectur . A Mountain View , Calif. , outfit call Mashgin use comput vision to autom retail checkout . Up Highway 101 in San Mateo , a compani call Alluxio is creat way to make cloud-bas A.I . work better . Last week , a San Francisco compani call Mesospher , which make a way to oper among variou corpor and public cloud , rais $ 73.5 million .Microsoft and Amazon are race Googl to domin the new architectur .Thi week , Microsoft will kick off a confer in San Francisco that is expect to focu on way machine-bas intellig can be use to analyz , among other thing , the Microsoft graph ,  or all the data compani alreadi have in the Microsoft product theyv own for decad .Amazon last year announc it own machine-learn servic , and it is amass it own larg repositori of corpor data .Hewlett Packard Enterpris , an older compani struggl to find it way in the new landscap , wa one of the investor in Mesospher .When you are build predict data , you dont know what you are go to need next ,  said William Hilf , a senior vice presid at H.P.E . If someon make a bet in machin learn on Microsoft or Googl , they may need to come down to their old data system , too . We are build platform to bridg among all of them.To Ms. Green , all of the activ so far , along with the size and sophist of comput , is small compar to what will happen when the world biggest busi start lean on the new A.I . technolog .We may build an A.I . system to figur out all the way busi can use thi ,  she joke . The relationship between big compani and deep machin intellig is just starting.', 'A new virtual gold rush is underway .Even as Bitcoin , riven by intern divis , ha struggl , a rival virtual currenc  known as Ethereum  ha soar in valu , climb 1,000 percent over the last three month .Beyond the price spike , Ethereum is also attract attent from giant in financ and technolog , like JPMorgan Chase , Microsoft and IBM , which have describ it as a sort of Bitcoin 2.0 .The rise of the rel new virtual currenc ha been help by a battl within the Bitcoin commun over how the basic Bitcoin softwar should develop .The fight have slow down Bitcoin transact and led some peopl to look for altern virtual currenc to power their busi . Enter Ethereum .Like Bitcoin , the Ethereum system is built on a blockchain in which everi transact is record publicli . The promis of such a system is that it allow the exchang of money and asset more quickli and more cheapli than reli on a long chain of middlemen .But Ethereum ha also won fan with it promis to do much more than Bitcoin . In addit to the virtual currenc , the softwar provid a way to creat onlin market and programm transact known as smart contract .The system is complic enough that even peopl who know it well have troubl describ it in plain English . But one applic in develop would let farmer put their produc up for sale directli to consum and take payment directli from consum . There are alreadi dozen of function applic built on Ethereum , enabl new way to manag and pay for electr , sport bet and even Ponzi scheme .All of thi work is still veri earli . The first full public version of the Ethereum softwar wa recent releas , and the system could face some of the same technic and legal problem that have tarnish Bitcoin .Mani Bitcoin advoc say Ethereum will face more secur problem than Bitcoin becaus of the greater complex of the softwar . Thu far , Ethereum ha face much less test , and mani fewer attack , than Bitcoin . The novel design of Ethereum may also invit intens scrutini by author given that potenti fraudul contract , like the Ponzi scheme , can be written directli into the Ethereum system .But the sophist capabl of the system have made it fascin to some execut in corpor America . IBM said last year that it wa experi with Ethereum as a way to control real world object in the so-cal Internet of thing .Microsoft ha been work on sever project that make it easier to use Ethereum on it comput cloud , Azur .Ethereum is a gener platform where you can solv problem in mani industri use a fairli eleg solut  the most eleg solut we have seen to date ,  said Marley Gray , a director of busi develop and strategi at Microsoft .Mr. Gray is respons for Microsoft work with blockchain , the databas concept that Bitcoin introduc . Blockchain are design to store transact and data without requir ani central author or repositori .Blockchain ledger are gener maintain and updat by network of comput work togeth  somewhat similar to the way that Wikipedia is updat and maintain by all it user .Mani corpor , though , have creat their own Ethereum network with privat blockchain , independ of the public system , and that could ultim detract from the valu of the individu unit in the Ethereum system  known as an Ether  that peopl have recent been buy .The interest in Ethereum is one sign of the corpor fascin with blockchain . Most major bank have express an interest in use them to make trade and money transfer faster and more effici . On Tuesday , execut from the largest bank will gather for a confer , Blockchain : Tap Into the Real Potenti , Cut Through the Hype.Mani of these bank have recent been look at how some version of Ethereum might be put to use . JPMorgan , for instanc , ha creat a specif tool , Masala , that allow some of it intern databas to interact with an Ethereum blockchain .Michael Novogratz , a former top execut at the privat equiti firm Fortress Invest Group , who help lead Fortress invest in Bitcoin , ha been look at Ethereum sinc he left Fortress last fall . Mr. Novogratz said that he made a significant purchas of Ether in Januari . He ha also heard how the financi industry chatter about the virtual currenc ha evolv .A lot of the more establish player were think , It still an experi ,   he said . It feel like in the last two to three month that experi is at least get a lot more validation.Sinc the begin of the year , the valu of an individu unit of Ether ha soar as high as $ 12 from around $ 1 . That ha brought the valu of all exist Ether to over $ 1 billion at time , significantli more than ani virtual currenc other than Bitcoin , which had over $ 6 billion in valu outstand last week .Sinc Bitcoin wa invent , there have been mani so-cal alt-coin that have tri to improv on Bitcoin , but none have won the follow of Ethereum .Unlik Bitcoin , which wa releas in 2009 by a mysteri creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto , Ethereum wa creat in a more transpar fashion by a 21-year-old Russian-Canadian , Vitalik Buterin , after he drop out of Waterloo Univers in Ontario .The most basic aim of Ethereum wa to make it possibl to program bind agreement into the blockchain  the smart contract concept . Two peopl , for instanc , could program a bet on a sport game directli into the Ethereum blockchain . Onc the final score came in from a mutual agre upon sourc  say , The Associ Press  the money would be automat transfer to the win parti . Ether can be use as a currenc in thi system , but Ether are also necessari to pay for the network power need to process the bet .The Ethereum system ha sometim been describ as a singl share comput that is run by the network of user and on which resourc are parcel out and paid for by Ether .A team of seven co-found help Mr. Buterin write up the softwar after he releas the initi descript of the system . Mr. Buterin team rais $ 18 million in 2014 through a presal of Ether , which help fund the Ethereum Foundat , which support the software develop .Like Bitcoin , Ethereum ha succeed by attract a dedic network of follow who have help support the softwar , partli in the hope that their Ether will increas in valu if the system succe . Last week , there were 5,800 comput  or node  help support the network around the world . The Bitcoin network had about 7,400 node .One of Mr. Buterin co-found , Joseph Lubin , ha set up ConsenSi , a compani base in Brooklyn that ha hire over 50 develop to build applic on the Ethereum system , includ one that enabl music distribut and anoth that allow for a new kind of financi audit .The ConsenSi offic are in an old industri build in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn . The offic is essenti one larg room , with all the messi trademark of a start-up oper , includ white board on the wall and comput part lie around .Mr. Lubin said he had thrown himself into Ethereum after start to think that it deliv on some of the fail promis of Bitcoin , especi when it came to allow new kind of onlin contract and market .Bitcoin present the broad stroke vision , and Ethereum present the crystal of how to deliv that vision ,  he said .Joseph Bonneau , a comput scienc research at Stanford who studi so-cal crypto-curr , said Ethereum wa the first system that had realli caught hi interest sinc Bitcoin .It is far from a sure thing , he caution .Bitcoin is still probabl the safest bet , but Ethereum is certainli No . 2 , and some folk will say it is more like to be around in 10 year ,  Mr. Bonneau said . It will depend if ani real market develop around it . If there is some actual application.', 'The thing about dictat is they dont have to answer ani stink question from the press . We call it undemocrat ; they call it job secur .That whi Presid Obama joint news brief with Presid Ral Castro of Cuba last week wa so extraordinari . For the first time sinc the earliest day of the revolut , independ report pose tough question to a Cuban presid name Castro on Cuban soil for a Cuban televis audienc , live . It wa a moment all of us would have talk a lot more about had ISI not intrud with mass murder in Brussel .The first question came from Jim Acosta of CNN , whose father fled the island on the eve of the Cuban missil crisi , and he made sure the opportun didnt go to wast . Whi do you have Cuban polit prison ?  he ask . And whi dont you releas them ? You could watch in real time as Mr. Castro came to term with the idea that thi wa actual happen . He stammer and got himself into a muddl over how thi whole news confer deal work , anyway . Wa the question direct at him ? It wa onli with prompt from Presid Obama that he final answer Mr. Acosta , though by demand a list prove that ani such prison even exist . ( Happi to help you out with that , Sir . )Mr. Castro made sure hi Cuban audienc did not forget who wa in charg when he chastis the report from state televis who attempt to join the fun with hi own anodyn seri of question . You are ask too mani question to me ,  Mr. Castro told the eager beaver . I think question should be direct to Presid Obama.So , no , the island major daili newspap , Granma , is not about to do a five-part seri on domest wiretap . But you realli couldnt begrudg Presid Obama for wink at the camera dure the news brief and take a mini victori lap afterward , tell David Muir of ABC News , Today , itself , wa an exhibit of what happen when we have thi kind of engagement. It wa , at least , a tini step forward for transpar and press freedom in Cuba .And that is truli great , realli . Now , much as I hate to break up the festiv , Mr. Presid . ...What Mr. Obama help enabl in Cuba , albeit briefli , he and hi administr are help to erod back home .He got compani , and Ill get to that . But let begin with the latest regress news from the Unit State press freedom front , which came by way of The Associ Press just two day befor Air Forc One took off for Havana . The A.P . report that thi administr had set a record for fail to fulfil request made under the Freedom of Inform Act , which requir feder agenc to answer all reason inquiri , with some exempt for nation secur , privaci and law enforc matter .The act often provid the best tunnel into the otherwis impenetr feder bureaucraci , expos wrongdo and incompet . It can be vital if you want to find out how your town water becam undrink , for exampl , or how the administr arriv at the legal justif for the target drone kill of an American citizen abroad .It wa more than a littl disappoint when the White Hous press secretari , Josh Earnest , gave The A.P . an answer that wa not all that differ from the one Mr. Castro offer in Havana ; he wa not familiar with The A.P. number on F.O.I.A . request , Mr . Earnest said , so he did not speak to them directli .You could write off the whole affair as bureaucrat bungl , if it did not fit a broader pattern dure Mr. Obama two term  the crimin investig into govern leaker and whistle-blow by hi Justic Depart ; relat incid of snoop into reporters phone record and email ; and a more gener press strategi that frequent put the presid in front of opinion writer and non-journalist media person but rare provid formal interview to the report who cover him daili , mani of whom work for tradit newspap and wire servic .Grant , hi White Hous ha been savvi in use new and altern media in way the current crop of presidenti candid would be wise to follow . Appear like the one with the comedian Zach Galifianaki on the websit Funni or Die , and on the comic Marc Maron W.T.F. podcast , expos Mr. Obama to audienc that are tune out tradit media .But the strategi can produc awkward result , as it did last week just hour after the Brussel attack . Hi main sit-down interview of the day wa with ESPN , at an exhibit basebal game . By necess , the convers toggl between the horror in Brussel and the univers injustic of home-field offici .More subtl  and import  by avoid the press corp that cover him daili , Mr. Obama undercut the tradit journal that he say he hold dear , which is alreadi fight for it surviv against the wave of new media that the presid is ride with such agil .Hi aid argu that the presid can do it all , tradit and upstart . And he will possibl speak for himself about it on Monday night when he address report at the annual Toner Prize dinner , name in honor of our deceas Time colleagu Robin Toner , who passion believ that basic journalist prioriti  substanc over nois  should be inviol .But hi speech will be a coda . What matter more now is what come next .

Each one learn from the one that came before.Hillari Clinton , the Democrat front-runn , ha face question about her open becaus of the privat email server she kept as secretari of state and her long stretch between news confer .

If hotel are consist not offer the most attract price to consum , our algorithm would push other hotel ahead.Mr. Ranqu also said that the hotel would lose custom who would have been direct to the hotels websit by a third parti .Wer tri to make them understand it a bad approach ,  he said of Hilton .Geraldin Calpin , Hilton global head of market , say the campaign goal is to make consum awar of the goodi avail to loyalti custom who book directli  includ lower rate and room select  and to clear up misunderstand that crop up with third-parti booker .If you book direct , it get rid of the confus ,  Ms. Calpin said . Thi is where you can get the best price and the best value.The tension between onlin travel agenc and hotel chain  and airlin as well  ha been grow over the last few year .One factor is simpl econom . Hotel pay commiss if a third parti book the reserv . Thi commiss is 15 to 20 percent for each book , said Cindi Esti Green , chief execut of Kalibri Lab , which provid research to the hotel industri about revenu perform .Anoth factor is the increas concern about consum confus  that is , custom think they are book directli with a hotel and find out later that they use a third-parti site . Sometim consum think they are book reserv that can be cancel without charg , onli to find out later that is not the case  or they arriv at a hotel to discov that they do not actual have reserv .The Feder Trade Commiss ha gotten veri interest in thi ,  Ms. Esti Green said . Some consum are not just perplex about whether they are book directli or through a third parti , she say , but also who realli offer the lowest price .The fact is , most hotel and onlin travel agenc have rate parity agreement that neither can undercut the other price and that hotel must give the best price to all the onlin agenc and not favor one over anoth .Rate pariti ha come under deepen scrutini ; in 2014 , about 30 lawsuit were file in variou state against major hotel chain and online-book group say rate pariti violat antitrust law .The lawsuit were consolid and eventu dismiss becaus the plaintiff were unabl to prove that there wa an actual conspiraci between hotel and onlin travel agenc to set price , said Ils Scott , a lawyer who special in hospit law with the firm Michelman & Robinson .There are except to rate pariti .

', 'Donald Trump believ that a half-trillion-dollar trade deficit with the rest of the world make the Unit State a loser and countri with trade surplus like China and Mexico winner .Theyr beat us so badli ,  he ha said . Everi countri we lose money with.The realiti is differ . Trade deficit are not inher good or bad ; they can be either , depend on circumst . The trade deficit is not a scorecard .What more , elimin the trade deficit would not , on it own , make America great again , as Mr. Trump promis . And in isol , the fact that the Unit State ha a trade deficit doe not prove that trade agreement are bad for American , a stapl of Berni Sanders campaign in the Democrat presidenti primari . In fact , tri to elimin the trade deficit could mean give up some of the key lever of power that allow the Unit State to get it way in intern polit .Get rid of the trade deficit could veri well make America less great . The reason have to do with the global reserv currenc , econom diplomaci and someth call the Triffin dilemma .Imagin a world where there are onli two countri , and onli two product . One countri make car ; the other grow banana .Peopl in CarNat want banana , so they buy $ 1 million worth from peopl in BananaLand . Resid of BananaLand want car , so they buy $ 2 million of them from CarNat .That differ is the trade deficit : BananaLand ha a $ 1 million trade deficit ; CarNat ha a $ 1 million trade surplu .But thi doe not mean that BananaLand is losing to CarNat . Car are realli use , and BananaLandit got a lot of them in exchang for their money .Similarli , it true that the Unit State ha a $ 58 billion trade deficit with Mexico , for exampl . But it not as if American were just fling money across the Rio Grand out of chariti . American get a lot of good stuff for that : avocado , for exampl , and Cancn vacat .If you want to think of it in term of winner and loser , in fact , you could justifi revers Mr. Trump prefer frame : Those loser in Mexico gave us $ 58 billion more stuff than we gave them last year . Ha , ha , ha . Wer winners.Mayb .It is true that a trade deficit subtract from a country gross domest product . G.D.P . measur the valu of good and servic produc within a country border , so when a countri is sell less stuff abroad than it buy from abroad , the countri is make less stuff , and as a result there are fewer job . Thi piec of the Trump theori of trade is true .But when a countri run a trade deficit , as the Unit State doe , there is a countervail forc . Think back to our pretend countri . BananaLand ha a $ 1 million trade deficit with CarNat . But that mean that car produc in CarNat are sit on an extra $ 1 million a year in incom .Someth ha to happen with that $ 1 million , and both of the two option have consequ .One option is to keep that money at home . But keep that money insid CarNat will push the valu of it currenc upward . And as it currenc goe up , car will becom more expens in BananaLand  caus peopl there to buy fewer of them until eventu the trade deficit is elimin .If CarNat doesnt want it currenc to rise , it ha to take that $ 1 million trade surplu and plow it back into BananaLand . There are differ way it could do that . Peopl in CarNat could buy stock or bond in BananaLand , or compani in CarNat could invest in factori in BananaLand , or the govern of CarNat could buy asset directli .The choic is stark : A countri run a trade surplu must either let it currenc rise or let money flow back to it trade partner .Thi isnt just an abstract . It what ha happen between the Unit State and China for the last coupl of decad . China ha had consist trade surplus , but it did not want it currenc to rise in a way that would undermin it export . So money ha flow from China into the Unit State  both from the Chines government purchas of Unit State Treasuri bond and more recent in the form of direct invest from Chines compani into the Unit State .When you see a headlin about a Chines compani buy an American hotel group for $ 13 billion , your see the flip side of the trade deficit Mr. Trump bemoan . ( The same when a citizen of China buy a luxuri apart in a Trump tower . ) Money flow into a countri is usual consid a good thing . It make borrow money cheaper , drive up stock price and can mean more invest in new busi .So doe a trade deficit mean fewer job ? It depend on which forc is more econom power : fewer job creat export or invest dollar flow into the countri .It depend on what the countri doe with the invest that come in .In theori , that money could go toward long-last invest with posit econom return : new factori and equip ; educ for the work forc ; and new road and bridg , or repair and improv to exist one .Unfortun , how countri use these capit inflow is not alway so good . In the Unit State , the influx of foreign capit in the mid-2000 went in larg part to fuel an unsustain hous and mortgag bubbl . Greece capit inflow in the same time period went to fund bloat public spend .When the world is fling money at you , it import to use it for someth product . It not that trade deficit ( and the capit inflow that are their flip side ) dont matter  but just know the number doesnt tell you much about whether they are good , bad or indiffer .It not clear that that even an option , becaus the dollar isnt use just in trade between the Unit State and other countri .The dollar is a global reserv currenc , mean that it is use around the world in transact that have noth to do with the Unit State . When a Malaysian compani doe busi with a German compani , in mani case it will do busi in dollar ; when wealthi peopl in Dubai or Singapore govern invest fund want to sock away money , they do so in larg part in dollar asset .That creat upward pressur on the dollar for reason unrel to trade flow between the Unit State and it partner . That , in turn , make the dollar stronger , and American export less competit , than they would be in a world where nobodi use the dollar for anyth except commerc involv the Unit State .The roughli $ 500 billion trade deficit that the Unit State run each year isnt just about poorli negoti trade deal and currenc manipul by thi or that countri . It also , to some degre , a byproduct of the central role the Unit State play in the global financi system .There even a name for thi : the Triffin dilemma . In the mid-20th centuri , the economist Robert Triffin warn that the provid of the global reserv currenc would need to run perpetu trade deficit to keep the world financi system from freez , with those trade deficit potenti fuel domest boom and bust .The key idea is that if a Presid Trump or ani other futur leader realli want to reduc our trade deficit in a major way , that leader is go to have to rethink the veri underpin of global financ .Be care what you wish for .There no doubt that maintain the global reserv currenc creat cost for the Unit State , name a less competit export industri .But it also creat a lot of advantag . Lower interest rate and higher stock price are among them ( though they have the downsid of also feed debt-driven boom and bust ) . Even more import is what the dollar promin in global financ doe for America place in the world .It help ensur that the Unit State can afford to financ war , and it give the govern greater abil to fight recess and panic . A countri experienc a bank panic will see money sent out of the countri , caus it currenc to fall and it interest rate to rise . All that limit a government option for fix the problem . In 2008 , when the Unit State experienc a near collaps of the bank system , the opposit happen .But it not just econom . A lot of the benefit of have the reserv currenc are more on the foreign polici side than the econom ,  said Jennif M. Harri , a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relat and author of a come book , War by Other Mean ,  on the use of econom tool in foreign polici .The central of the dollar to global financ give the Unit State power on the global stage that no other countri can match . It ha enforc sanction on Iran , Russia , North Korea and terrorist group with the implicit threat of cut off access to the dollar payment system for ani bank in the world that doe not cooper with American foreign polici .Part of what make the Unit State power is the great import of the dollar to global financ . And part of the price the Unit State pay for that statu is a stronger currenc and higher trade deficit than would be the case otherwis .The debat over the trade deficit is about more than Mexico and China , car and banana , or win and lose . It about what make America great , and which of the country prioriti should come first .', 'Justic Sandra Day OConnor , who turn 86 on Saturday , ha mani achiev to her name , includ serv as a state senat in Arizona and becom the first woman appoint to the Suprem Court , where she serv for almost a quarter-centuri .Now she can add an accomplish for the digit era : video game impresario .Justic OConnor is behind an anim civic educ game call Win the White Hous , whose latest edit wa recent releas .

Justic Sonia Sotomayor join iCivics govern board last Novemb .In a phone interview on Friday , Justic Sotomayor said she thought it wa brilliant of Justic OConnor to realiz that comput game could be a veri success way to interest kid in civic education. Justic Sotomayor , who said she develop an earli interest in law after watch the Perri Mason televis show , said she had incorpor iCiv into her own frequent visit to school , where she encourag student to learn how govern work and to get involv in their commun .I thought thi wa realli in keep with my messag to kid about how law affect you everi singl day ,  Justic Sotomayor said , ad that she ha play the game . Theyr fun . Iv challeng my clerk to play them to see how they do.The involv of the two justic in digit educ game underscor a grow belief among educ that interact tool may improv students engag in their own learn . In Januari , Microsoft introduc an educ version of Minecraft , the popular game in which player use block to construct elabor virtual world . Last fall , Googl unveil Expedit , a virtual realiti system for classroom use that take student on simul field trip around the world .Teacher who have use Win the White Hous said the game help their student experi and understand the complic trade-off that candid often make .Anna Nelson , assist princip at Bronx Latin , a high school in New York Citi , recent divid her 12th-grade honor civic class into Democrat and Republican team and assign them to play the game . Along the way , her student learn the differ between conserv and liber polit belief , and that candid had to stick to the platform they had chosen , she said . They also learn to select run mate from differ background to broaden their appeal with voter .It taught them so mani thing in one short simul ,  Ms. Nelson said . Now , when they come to class , they want to discuss new develop in the actual presidenti primari with her , she said .Justic Sotomayor suggest parent play the game with their children as well . Do you know how mani adult dont know anyth about civic ?  she said .Justic OConnor said she start iCiv out of concern that mani school had abandon the idea of teach student to becom engag citizen . She said she worri that student would not grow up to becom good leader , or even activ voter , if they did not understand , say , the import of an independ judiciari or their right to due process .A quarter of student can not demonstr a profici knowledg of how our govern work ,  Justic OConnor said , while their knowledg of TV show like American Idol is way up there.She said she began to serious investig the idea of educ game after consult with Jame Gee , a professor of literaci studi at Arizona State Univers and the author of a book titl What Video Game Have to Teach Us About Learn and Literacy.I explain to her that game were not about shoot peopl ,  Professor Gee said . They were about problem solving.Filament Game , a learn game compani in Madison , Wis. , one of whose founder is a former student of Professor Gee , design the game for iCiv , which is base in Cambridg , Mass . Justic OConnor own passion and prioriti were central to the develop of a number of the game  among them Suprem Decis , in which student take on the role of an imaginari Suprem Court justic who must cast the decid vote in a case .In one of the most popular iCiv game , call Do I Have a Right ? , student run a fiction constitut law firm , take on client , figur out which right appli to them and argu their case . Although the game could not have anticip recent contenti issu like the iPhon privaci fight between Appl and the F.B.I. , it cover topic that may give student insight into current event or their own experi .I wa struck that mani student did not know their right ,  said Danni OSullivan , a 17-year-old high school senior in Washington . The son of one of Justic OConnor former clerk , he help test the iCiv game with student at a differ local high school . They didnt know that if a cop stop them and search them without a reason , it wa illeg ,  he said .The game also ha play element . Student who collect enough point to buy a virtual coffe maker for their imaginari law firm will find that the game speed up , in a nod to the avail of virtual caffein .Justic OConnor said it wa import for the game to be inclus and nonpartisan .Student who play Win the White Hous may choos avatar , male or femal ; blond or brunet ; goate or clean-shaven ; Democrat or Republican ; beig or brown . But whether player decid to support , say , gun right or gun control , the game provid neutral explan of each stanc .Justic OConnor will go down in the annal of American histori for be the FWOTSC  her nicknam for First Woman on the Suprem Court  not to mention the swing vote in Bush v. Gore , the Suprem Court case that effect settl the contest 2000 presidenti elect . But these day , she like to say her effort to encourag student to understand and particip in govern repres her most import legaci .When she attend a recent reunion of her former clerk , she insist that they bring laptop so she and their children  she call them the grandclerk  could play iCiv game togeth .Govern isnt hand down in the gene ,  Justic OConnor said .

A hand of independ store around the countri have taken the trade on the road , in an effort to stir up busi and bring book to neighborhood and suburb without a bookstor .

It will doubl in size , ad 2,500 squar feet of retail space , when it take over a recent vacat storefront next door . It owner consid look for a second locat , but decid the book van would be a better way to expand the store geograph rang and custom base .The van pack around 1,000 book , mostli new releas and best seller  a small fraction of Parnassus stock of 20,000 book . It owner have manag to make the cramp space bright and invit : custom can walk the narrow aisl between the shelv , and can linger and sampl book on one of the pad blue bench .One of my hope is that well be abl go into some of the outli suburb and citi that dont necessarili have a bookstor ,  said Grace Wright , a Parnassu booksel who will manag the bookmobil .

Last time a compani tri to get fanci with crazi softwar featur on a smartphon wa Amazon with it Fire phone . And we all know how that turn out .So what next ?

You see them through all of life up and down ,  a woman voic say as the ad end .The commerci for New York Life , which is part of an advertis campaign to get consum to associ the compani with the good thing in life rather than the insur it sell , is just one exampl of how an insur is tri to solv a difficult problem : how to market a product that remind peopl of their own mortal .That not an easi subject for peopl to talk about ,  said Todd Fancher , presid of the American Famili Life Insur Compani . Your realli talk about buy death insurance.Life insur compani must overcom other signific barrier . Life insur , for one , is option , and most peopl do not think about buy it until marriag , the birth of a child or anoth signific event . When it come time to make a decis , insurance complex and people mispercept about how much they need and what it cost can drive peopl away .The insur industri as a whole offer an array of polici that it sometim mask in confus name . Life insur polici , for instanc , can come with modifi like whole ,  term and univers ,  the mean of which are not necessarili obviou to consum .What interest about life insur is that we know that most peopl valu it ,  said Todd A. Silverhart , director of insur research at Limra , an insur trade organ . But we also know that there a lot of confus in consumers mind in how to go about buy it , how much they need , who to buy it from.Over the last sever decad , the percentag of household in the Unit State that own life insur ha fallen . Seventi percent of American household now own life insur , down from 83 percent in the 1970 , accord to Limra .Anek Belbas , a research at the Center for Retir Research at Boston Colleg who help conduct a recent studi on life insur purchas decis , said peopl gener shi away from make the difficult financi calcul requir to determin how much life insur they need . He said they resort instead to mental shortcut when budget for life insur , which could distort how much coverag they thought they should buy .For instanc , peopl tend to think about how much money their famili will need to pay off big futur liabil like a mortgag , but few consid how much life insur they will need to replac their monthli incom . As a result , he said , peopl often miscalcul how much insur they need .Mr. Silverhart of Limra said that for a 20-year , $ 250,000 term life insur polici , about 80 percent of consum overestim the annual cost , make it seem less afford .Howard Kunreuth , a professor at the Wharton School of the Univers of Pennsylvania who studi insur and behavior econom and who ha written a book on the subject , said anoth barrier to sell ani kind of insur wa that peopl thought of it as an invest rather than a protect measur .The hardest thing to convinc peopl on an insur polici is that the best return on a polici is no return at all ,  he said . The whole idea is to tri to convinc peopl that insur is a form of protection.But that kind of think can make life insur a tough sell . Whi buy protect now for an event that is uncomfort to think about anyway ?To break down some of these barrier , compani are tri new market approach to reach consum more directli and make the buy process easier .In 2013 , MetLif set up kiosk in Walmart locat in South Carolina and Georgia where custom could buy the first month of a life insur polici for $ 5 . The pilot program end in 2015 . Protect Life ha work with Costco Wholesal to offer life insur to the retailer member . Massachusett Mutual Life Insur Compani start the Societi of Grownup to promot financi literaci , with a locat in Brooklin , Mass. , where peopl can meet with a financi advis or attend a class .It is realli about build relationship with custom ,  said Telisa Yanci , vice presid for market for American Famili Insur , which tri to connect with local commun through civic group and religi organ .Some compani also tri to persuad consum to buy life insur through advertis campaign that deliber have noth to do with mortal .In addit to it recent commerci featur babi learn to walk , New York Life also ha ad that depict parent do thing with their children , like ride roller coaster . American Famili Insur recent introduc an ad show the footbal player J. J.

We found that peopl did significantli wors on a test of financi literaci  we ask them question about such thing as inflat and interest rate  when they took the test on a smartphon , at least when compar with those who use pen and paper .Thi new data build on a larg amount of evid outlin the potenti decision-mak hazard pose by digit technolog .

Becaus smartphon can encourag us to tap and swipe quickli , we might neglect the long-term consequ of our behavior . A pizza smother in bacon might tast delici , but it probabl not good for our diet .

Pay attent to detail . Pay attent , pay attent , pay attent ! Our entir live wer warn : Pay attent , or. Well , you know . The worst will happen .But when it come to your invest portfolio , pleas do not pay too much attent to it . Market research clearli show that when your horizon is not today , not next week , but way in the futur , the most profit strategi is to invest more heavili in riskier asset  that is , stock  than peopl are prone to do .The real question is , Whi dont peopl invest more in stock ? Thi profound mysteri is sometim describ as the equiti premium puzzl ,  becaus although over the last centuri the relationship between risk and return ha greatli favor stock over bond , enthusiasm for invest in stock ha not follow .Perhap the best insight into thi mysteri come from so-cal behavior econom . Peopl , the think goe , tend to be loss-avers . That is , even when their portfolio show gain , they are gener more keenli awar of compar loss . That mean that for most peopl , the pain of a $ 100 loss is more acut than the joy of a $ 100 gain .Loss avers can put a signific strain on portfolio . Data show that when peopl evalu their invest frequent  sever time a week , or even multipl time a day  the return on riski asset like stock are often lower than those on safer asset like bond . But when a portfolio is examin less frequent , perhap onc a quarter , the opposit is more like .The result of lab and field experi suggest that the invest behavior of even profession trader fall in line with loss avers . And thi avers , combin with frequent review of invest , lead to underinvest in riskier asset like stock .Those who complain about the cost of colleg or worri that they havent save enough for retir would probabl have made more money if they hadnt been hobbl by loss avers .So what can we do ? Well , not pay ( too much ) attent to your portfolio is a good first step . It wont be easi . Just as Odysseu had himself tie to the mast to keep from be seduc by siren , summon the will power to keep from micromanag your invest . Set an appoint calendar with the date you may look at invest , and stick to it .Thi is not to dismiss other time when your invest should be re-examin : after a birth , a death , a job loss . But in gener you should evalu your portfolio onli onc everi three month . Even better , do as I do and peek onli everi six month .Im proof that thi strategi can work .

Not a big chang , so I left it intact . The index ha sinc doubl , to 17,000 .Had I been evalu my stock daili in earli 2009 , loss avers might have compel me to sell when the Dow dip to around 6,500 . I would have miss the signific return that the market ha had to offer in the last seven year . And I would have endur a lot of stress even if I had not sold .Avoid the sweet song of beauti siren wasnt easi , but Odysseu did it . You can , too .', 'Ken Dychtwald , who is 65 and is the chief execut offic of Age Wave , a consult and research compani focus on age , decid in hi 50 that he and hi wife should buy long-term care insur so they wouldnt be a burden on each other or their children if they becam ill or disabl .Mark V. Pauli , 74 , a professor of health care manag , busi econom and public polici at the Wharton School at the Univers of Pennsylvania , consid long-term care insur and decid against it .He is self-insuring  that is , stash enough in save so that , hope , it will cover ani need that aris .Both are expert in the field of age and both understand , more than most , the potenti cost of pay for care in later year . But they took differ path in address those need .Even as the debat about how to take care of an age popul grow , interest in long-term care insur ha wane . Individu market sale of long-term insur stood at 380,000 in 1990 , peak at 750,000 in 2002 and were at the lowest figur in a quarter-centuri at 110,000 in 2015 , accord to the American Associ for Long-Term Care Insur .That slide ha occur for a number of reason . First , insur compani found themselv face with more claim , and more expens claim , than they had anticip . Anoth factor is that the low interest rate of recent year mean their invest didnt earn what they onc did .Compani began rais premium on long-term care polici . Some left the busi . Long-term care insur develop a reput for be unpredict .Now , onli about eight million American , of the almost 45 million who are 65 and older , have such insur , which is usual sold to peopl in their 50 and 60 . The averag long-term care insur premium for a coupl who are both 60 year old is $ 2,000 to $ 3,500 annual , accord to the American Associ for Long-Term Care Insur . The older you get , the more difficult and more expens it is to buy .That hypothet coupl would be elig , upon buy the insur , for $ 164,000 each in benefit , which would go up to $ 365,000 each when they turn 85 . Polici holder must be medic certifi as disabl to collect the insur , but onc that occur , they no longer have to pay premium . Polici vari wide in what they cover , so it import to do some research . Caring.com offer help tip , includ make sure the polici includ control premium increas and inflat protect .Research show that peopl who buy such insur tend to be veri conscienti and cautiou .Theyr the peopl who get their flu shot , get their mammogram , exercis , alway wear seatbelt ,  said Kathleen McGarri , a professor of econom at U.C.L.A. , whose research focus on the well-b of the elderli . So that mean the veri peopl most like to buy long-term care insur are the veri one who are least like to need it .The lack of interest in the insur probabl stem from a number of factor .One is the mistaken notion that Medicaid will help them when they need it .The presenc of Medicaid crowd out insur ,  said Gopi Shah Goda , a senior research scholar at the Stanford Institut for Econom Polici Research . It a classic case of the more insur provid by govern , the less incent there is to buy private. But to receiv Medicaid , you must be essenti impoverish .Famili dynam come into play , as well . Survey show that most peopl are divid about whether they want profession or their famili member to take care of them if need , accord to research by Professor Goda and McGarri , and Prof. Jeffrey R. Brown , who teach financ at the Univers of Illinoi at Urbana-Champaign . Not surprisingli , 26 percent of those survey who said they prefer profession care had long-term insur , compar with 15.7 percent who would rather have their children care for them .And some peopl have a differ worri : that long-term insur will make it too easi for their kid to put them in a nurs home ,  Professor Pauli said .The decis is complex and tough to make becaus no one know whether 24-hour care or just partial care will be need . Insur compani have too often oversold worst-cas situat , pli peopl with more coverag than they need at higher premium , said Anthoni Webb , the research director at the Retir Equiti Lab at the New School for Social Research . The realiti is that the averag stay in a nurs home for men is 10 month , and the averag for women is just over one year , he said .The averag annual cost of a semipriv room in a nurs home is $ 81,030 , while the averag home health care cost is $ 21 an hour , accord to Long-Term Care : How Big a Risk ?  publish in 2014 by the Center for Retir Research at Boston Colleg .For Mr. Dychtwald , concern about hi wife and children wa the reason he decid to get long-term care insur .He know insur will not cover all the cost , but say he believ it will take a larg burden off hi famili if he becom disabl in some way .Professor Pauli said he assess the benefit of long-term insur and self-insur and decid that he prefer to put money into annuiti and other fund to ensur an annual incom of at least $ 100,000 dure hi retir year to cover hi long-term health care need .Maureen Whelan , a financi planner , said that long-term insur for her age parent had one signific emot benefit . It made it easier for my parent to accept help in the home , know that they had paid for thi type of insur ,  she said . I believ it would have been quit a struggl for my sibl and I to convinc my father to start pay out of pocket for home health aides.She said she relay her experi to client but realiz that the decis to purchas insur is much harder now  the premium are so high and the benefit limited.A new option is includ long-term care coverag in a gener life insur polici .For year , expert have been look at way to revis govern and privat long-term insur to make it more palat and effect . One idea is to have payment go directli to those who need it  or their children , if they are the caregiv  rather than the nurs home or home health care . That way , children who leav their job to take care of their parent can receiv some reimburs .The real challeng , said Dylan Ross , a financi planner with Garrett Plan Network , is get peopl to take a hard look at what variou situat in the futur might look like , someth that is not easi when face with the all-too-human desir to ignor unpleas topic .What would I need if I had a short-term stay in a rehabilit or a skill nurs home ?  he said . What would I need for an extend stay ? How doe that affect my spous ? Should I spend on premium or beef up my save ? Or as Ms. Whelan said , thi process of imagin the futur i about so much more than insurance.', 'From their earliest day , the loos confeder research effort that came to be known as behavior econom spawn a larg quantiti of studi center on secur invest . Thi wa not becaus the field pioneer were especi interest in stock and bond , nor wa the earli research commonli underwritten by financi servic firm .Rather , the hive of activ that evolv into it own field  behavior financ  reflect that invest market provid unusu robust data set for analyz judgment under uncertainty ( the titl of a semin textbook co-edit by the winner of a Nobel in econom scienc , the behavior economist Daniel Kahneman ) and decis under risk ( a phrase in the subtitl of hi Nobel-win Prospect Theory ) . Everi day , global secur market provid research with billion of data point for understand how peopl make choic when resourc are at stake and the outcom is unknown .Which , if you think about it , is a fair descript of most decis . Inde , the major of cognit bias and shortcut that influenc everyday judgment and choic have analogu in invest behavior . Consid the sunk cost fallaci ,  a primari reason an unhappi lawyer might struggl to leav the law and an unsuccess investor might balk at sell money-los share .Both peopl are highli like to obsess over their sunk cost  law school tuition and time serv for the lawyer , the origin invest amount for the stock picker  in a nonconsci desir to justifi their earlier decis . Both are also veri like to fall prey to loss avers ,  a key tenet of Prospect Theori , which tell us that human typic respond to the loss of resourc  be it time , effort , emot , materi good or their proxi , i.e. , money  more strongli than they react to a similar gain .What differenti the typic lawyer and averag investor , howev , is their justif for engag in their activ . Lawyer are train to do what they do , while the major of investor are not . Ask a random player in a law firm basketbal leagu whether he or she could compet with LeBron Jame , and the most common respons will be laughter . Yet mani of those lawyer would willingli compet with the billionair investor Warren E. Buffett .Despit the spectacular growth of index fund  passiv invest vehicl that track market averag and minim transact cost  million of amateur investor continu to activ buy and sell secur regularli . Thi despit overwhelm evid that even profession investor are no more like to beat the market than monkey throw dart at secur list .Money manag , at least , are paid to make invest bet . But whi do amateur believ they can outperform the profession  or even identifi those pro who will outperform ? ( Perform of individu mutual fund can not be predict with ani greater degre of accuraci than individu stock or bond . ) Mani bias and cognit error contribut to thi costli behavior , but a few deserv mention .Consid thi pair of challeng :Give high and low estim for the averag weight of an empti Boe 747 , pick number far enough apart to be 90 percent certain that the true answer fall somewher in between . Now , give high and low estim for the diamet of the moon in mile . Again , choos number far enough apart to be 90 percent certain that the true answer fall somewher in between .Come up with a rang for each so you could confid bet $ 9 against the prospect of win $ 1 .As it happen , an empti 747 weigh nearli 400,000 pound , and the diamet of the moon is roughli 2,200 mile . But research involv these and similar problem suggest that these answer do not fall within your high and low estim . That becaus most peopl do not realiz how littl they know about the subject or how difficult it is to bracket estim as request .Instead , peopl come up with what they believ to be logic estim of the plane weight and moon diamet , then they adjust from those figur to arriv at their bracket . But unless you work for Boe or NASA , your initi estim are probabl go to be wildli off the mark , so the bracket should be wider they probabl are  say , from one pound to one billion pound for the plane weight and from one mile to a billion mile for the lunar diamet . That most peopl do not default to such broad rang reflect a trait that behavior economist call overconfid . Thi is not run-of-the-mil arrog , but rather the tendenc we all have to overr our abil , knowledg and skill , at whatev level we might place them .Studi have reveal signific overconfid in the judgment of scientist , lawyer , engin , doctor and those in other profess . The Univers of Pennsylvania psychologist Philip Tetlock and Barbara Meller collect more than 25,000 forecast from peopl whose job it wa to anticip how the futur would unfold . All demonstr remark overconfid . When they were 80 percent sure of their predict , they were correct less than 60 percent of the time .Anoth exampl is shown in a 2012 studi from the State Street Center for Appli Research , in which investor were ask about their financi acumen .Nearli two-third rate their financi sophist as advanc ,  said Mirtha Kastrap , a senior research analyst at State Street . Thi seem a littl optimist , so in our 2014 studi , The Folklor of Financ , we ran a financi literaci exam . The averag score wa just 61 percent , bare a pass grade . Thi disconnect between actual and perceiv financi sophist , she explain , is evid of how widespread the overconfid bia is.Overconfid is hard-wir into our brain becaus it is use . Mani of our mental bias evolv becaus they make us cautiou or they otherwis protect us from harm , but overconfid is part of a suit of cognit trait that serv to propel us forward . Just as no one would think to write a children book about a train engin that repeat , I think I cant ,  few explor would ventur into the wild  and few entrepreneur would start new busi  unless they believ that they would succeed in the face of long odd .A bia toward optim help to explain whi mani , if not most , smoker are confid that they will not develop cancer ; whi mani driver are certain that their text will not lead to an accid ; and whi mani investor believ they can outperform the market . We are evolutionarili program to believ that thing will work out ,  said David Hirshleif , a financ professor at the Univers of California , Irvin .More confound than the exist of investor overconfid is it persist : As market teach us costli lesson , we should grow humbl . But the fact that mani do not reflect what Professor Hirshleif describ as self-enhanc psycholog process . One of the biggest esteem builder is hindsight bia , or the tendenc to rewrit our own histori to make ourselv look good . In landmark experi by the psychologist Baruch Fischhoff , then at Hebrew Univers , studi particip were direct to make predict about real-lif event , then were ask period to recal the event and their predict after the fact . Hi find ? Particip consist misrememb their forecast , in way that made them look smarter . Too often we look back not in anger but in awe , at least of our own capac .Of cours , mani peopl easili recal failur , which suggest that hindsight bia is not all that power . But even when our failur remain vivid memori , we rememb them in a way that neutral their abil to inhibit our present-day decis . When event unfold that confirm our thought or deed , we attribut that happi outcom to our skill , knowledg or intuit . But when life prove our action or belief to have been wrong , we blame outsid caus over which we had no control  and thu maintain our faith in ourselv . The Harvard psychologist Ellen Langer describ the phenomenon as , Head I win , tail it chance.Final , even if investor are not rewrit histori or blame outsid forc , they are still highli like to miss sign of their own incompet . The culprit is confirm bia , which lead us to give too much weight to inform that support exist belief and discount that which doe not . And those exist belief need not be long held , explain Thoma Gilovich , a Cornel Univers psycholog professor . Onc one entertain the idea that thi seem like a good invest ,  the process of relev inform narrow consider  and in a direct that lead to overconfidence.Professor Gilovich , an author of The Wisest One in the Room : How You Can Benefit from Social Psychology Most Power Insight ,  warn that overcom overconfid is difficult . Common prescript includ a meaning period of dilig log one invest idea , to keep track of hit and miss . Note the emphasi on idea and not just action . More often than not , the aforement bias lead us to recal invest that soar that we thought to make but did not  and to forget those that plummet .Professor Hirshleif advis a strategi of self-distanc , or consid the opposit side of ani transact befor make it .Such a strategi wa also recommend by Professor Gilovich , with a caveat . Someth more specif and guid is like to be more effect , like conduct a pre-mortem ,   he said . The idea is to suppos that your idea bomb . What would you be say to yourself right now about how or whi you should have foreseen it ? ', 'A new crop of electron financi tool is tri to help American save .The fledgl app are appeal to consum like Brittney Gould , a 28-year-old retir plan consult in Rockvil , Md . Ms. Gould duti maxim automat paycheck deduct to fund her own workplac 401 ( k ) account . But for shorter-term save , she use the mobil app Qapit that let user set multipl save goal and have cash transfer into save , base on rule the user set .User can , for instanc , tell the app to save $ 5 everi time they buy a latt .Ms. Gould like be abl to custom her account . When she peek at her iPhon to see how much she ha accumul for pet expens , she see a photo of her dog . It more motiv , and meaning ,  she said . Sinc she began use the app last June , she ha save about $ 5,000 .Qapit , along with app like Digit , Dyme , Acorn and mani other , strive to use mobil technolog to make save easi and automat . Aim mainli at a young clientel , the new tool offer an updat take on tradit , somewhat stodgi save advic  start small , contribut regularli and take satisfact as your balanc grow  in an effort to make save fun .American are gener lacklust saver . Forty-on percent of household lack liquid save to cover an unexpect $ 2,000 expens , accord to research from the Pew Charit Trust , which also found that a lack of save is a top financi worri , even among famili with higher incom .One in three American famili report have no save , includ one in 10 of those with annual incom greater than $ 100,000 . Feder data show the overal person save rate in the Unit State is about 5 percent , and an analysi by Moody Analyt find that American under 35 actual have a neg save rate , mean they are spend more than they earn .The vast major of peopl need to save more , and some should save much more ,  said Dan Ari , a psychologist and behavior economist at Duke Univers and the head of CommonC Lab , which collabor with Qapit and other financi tool to identifi effect save strategi . ( Mr. Ari wa name chief behavior economist at Qapit in Octob , and own share in the compani ) .Whi is it so hard to save ? For one thing , our consum cultur is design to encourag spend . Everi coffe shop ,  he said , want you to buy anoth cup of coffee.Technolog ha also help make spend frictionless ,  he said . Think of the conveni of use Uber : With the tap of a phone , a car ride appear .The new tool aim to revers that pattern , by use technolog to make save as effortless as spend .Paula Pant , 32 , a person financ and real estat blogger in La Vega , ha use Digit for about a year . It pull tini amount that your not go to miss ,  she said . You just let it hum in the background. After just a few month , she said , she had save $ 814 .The app also use humor . Dyme text use personas like Terribl Parent ( Whi cant you be more like your sister ? Text to save $ 20 . Becaus I said so. )The app are not bank themselv , but act as a financi go-between , ferri fund between the customer check account and a separ account at an actual financi institut , so the fund are F.D.I.C.-insur . One except is Acorn , which put money into invest .The app are not without drawback , howev . Perhap the biggest hurdl for some consum is that the tool , like mani popular onlin budget tool , requir user to share their check account number and password , in order to link the account with the app so it can withdraw fund .Some app go beyond simpl save and transfer fund into invest account , where there is some risk of lose money . Acorn invest the spare change from round up purchas in fraction share in low-cost index exchange-trad fund , invest that are similar to mutual fund but trade like stock . The tool recommend one of five portfolio , depend on their risk toler , and rebal the invest period . ( While other so-cal robo advis offer mani more invest choic , Jeff Cruttenden , co-found of Acorn , said Acorn offer fewer option by design , so user are not overwhelm by choic . )Invest small amount is less intimid than invest a larg lump sum , said Mr. Cruttenden . Start with their chang is approachable.While the strictli save app are free , Acorn charg monthli fee . The basic charg for Acorn account with balanc of less than $ 5,000 is one dollar a month . Account with more than $ 5,000 pay 0.25 percent of the balanc a year..Jonathan Janseniu , a 23-year-old state worker in Panama Citi , Fla. , said he and hi husband use Acorn to save for colleg for their two young children . We have a regular save account ,  he said . But Id never put ani money in it.Becaus Acorn transfer small sum , he said , it foster save without feel like it take more out of my paycheck. After about 18 month , their account ha about $ 900 . Im not an expert ,  he said ,  so it an entranc into the market.What about the convent wisdom that it best to save first and invest onli after establish a substanti cushion ? Absolut , peopl should save befor they invest ,  Mr. Cruttenden said . But if it help them save when they otherwis wouldnt have , that veri powerful.It is not known how success the app are in help peopl save in the long term . Most of the emerg save app lack a clear current revenu sourc , and reli on start-up capit to fund oper . Qapit , for one , eventu plan to offer a debit card , so user can access their save directli ; the app would earn a share of the fee that the payment network charg retail for process debit purchas .', 'Save for retir should be simpl arithmet  the longer your money ha to grow , the more money you should have when you stop work . But save today for a distant tomorrow isnt so simpl , and ha a great deal to do with how peopl think about money .Sean Furlong , the director of financ and administr at Gilman School , a privat secondari school in Baltimor , said he realiz that while teach a busi class .He wa teach student , he said , but then I realiz I wasnt teach my faculti and staff.They didnt know the thing I wa teach to high school student ,  he ad . Mani of them had miss that.Mr. Furlong said he decid to ask the school for permiss to begin a retir educ program . It goal wa to increas particip in it retir plan and to educ peopl on think about their save choic and invest option .Nearli five year after Mr. Furlong push for that educ campaign , the school ha an averag contribut rate of 22 percent , up from 16 percent . ( Thi includ Gilman 8 percent match after particip contribut the first 7 percent of their salari . ) At the highest end , peopl are contribut 35 percent of their salari .Chang how peopl think about the money they save for retir is one of the central tenet of a movement that is base on behavior financ , the approach to econom that aim to understand how averag peopl , not ration economist , make financi decis .After all , it the way peopl behav around money that tend to derail their plan , not a lack of knowledg about what they need to do if they want to retir comfort .The biggest challeng is not save enough ,  said Liz Davidson , founder and chief execut of the consult Financi Finess and author of What Your Financi Advisor Isnt Tell You. Histor , there been a lot of focu on return . The return is on what you save , and most peopl arent save enough.Ms. Davidson , whose consult work with compani on their financi plan for employe , said that when it came to retir , her compani tri to get employe to think about how much they could set asid each day , and to forget about a larger monthli or annual number .Most peopl can save a few dollar a day or even $ 10 a day ,  she said . That doabl . But if you say , Can you save $ 300 a month or a coupl of thousand dollar a year ?  peopl will say , Whoa. Avoid that whoa ,  which is the hesit that can derail plan , is what consult like Ms. Davidson are tri to do . Just as save a bit more today is go to pay off in the futur , not save enough , fail to particip in a retir plan or take money out of a plan too earli can significantli reduc the amount of money avail decad later .Mani of these effort come back to semin work by Shlomo Benartzi and Richard H. Thaler , behavior economist who have research how to get peopl to be better retir saver .One of their conclus is peopl need to be nudg by employ to stay on track , often in way that keep them from miss the money they are save . These strategi includ automat enrol peopl in retir plan , ask whether they would like to increas their contribut when they receiv a rais and limit the invest choic so they would need to opt out of a broadli diversifi portfolio , which is like to produc the best return over time .As simpl as the nudg seem , they have been prove to work .The Nation Footbal League Player Associ , which repres current and former player , move to automat enrol it player in 2007 . Sinc then the particip rate ha gone to 90 percent , from 82 percent .You dont miss what you dont have ,  said Dana Hammond , senior director of player affair and develop .At Gilman School , Mr. Furlong push to limit the number of invest option , cut the fund it plan offer by 75 percent , while increas the educ about the one that were avail .It use to be faculti and staff could be invest 100 percent in commod fund and no one would care ,  Mr. Furlong said . Now the major are in target date funds.( Target date fund are set up so that the alloc of a person invest chang as the person get older . )Increas the amount peopl contribut ha also been a challeng . The default rate use to be 3 percent , which wasnt enough , said Aime R. DeCamillo , head of retir plan servic at T. Row Price , which provid plan for two million peopl at 3,500 compani . She said a save rate closer to 15 percent , includ the employ match , wa better .One way it get peopl closer to that number is to use behavior financ trick with it onlin portal . Thi come into play with increas the contribut rate . If your at 10 percent , well show you 13 , 15 , and 17 percent , know youll go for that middl number ,  she said . It drive behavior in the right direction.Anoth featur is what T. Row Price call it confid number ,  which aim to predict the likelihood that you will be abl to replic your salari in retir .It drive you to an experi where you chang assumpt ,  Ms. DeCamillo said . You can chang your retir age . You can adjust your salari ; you can pull in addit outsid asset . It help you build confid that you have thi control over the outcome.Aetna , which ha work with Financi Finess to develop it workplac program , began a yearlong initi thi month call Retir Readi . It goal is to help employe think about what they are save but also about what that money might be use for in retir .It about financi readi but also the emot and physic readi for retir ,  said Kay Mooney , vice presid for benefit at Aetna . It critic for front-lin employe who servic our custom . We know the busi is challeng if our employe are stress financially.Ms. Mooney said the compani would measur the program effect base on how employe chang behavior , like increas contribut to their 401 ( k ) plan or reduc their credit card debt .But success might also start by get peopl to rethink what their retir save are for .

Flexibl is veri important.', 'Sunil Yapa wa bounc from colleg to colleg , search for a career , when he decid to return to a familiar place : hi hometown , State Colleg , Pa . There , he found himself in the build where he had often visit hi father , Lakshman , a geographi professor at Penn State . He took hi dad class , help him write a draft of a book about the social construct of poverti and earn a bachelor degre in geographi in 2003 .I wa get readi to take over the famili busi ,  Mr. Yapa said .He plan to complet a doctor after an extend trip to China . But onc he land on the other side of the world , away from hi famili and cultur , he return to the write practic he had love as a teenag but abandon .I wa lucki ,  Mr. Yapa said . In the end I didnt have to choos just one . If I had walk away from write , I would have been a mess.He earn a Master of Fine Art from Hunter Colleg in 2010 and start a novel about Seattle 1999 World Trade Organ protest . Your Heart Is a Muscl the Size of a Fist ,  which includ theme about geographi , came out in Januari .It seem so stupid , look back on it ,  he said of hi struggl to accept a career that should have been obviou . Be a writer ha not been without a downsid , though ; befor he sold hi book , he took on side job , includ sell poster to colleg student , to get by .Accord to behavior economist , he is not unusu . Career choic are not obviou or simpl to make . Expert have found that bias that we are not awar of skew our percept of our option and creat blind spot on our choic . Understand these bias can help young peopl succeed in select a profess that will earn them a live and also yield fulfil , a sens of purpos and a chanc to master a skill that fascin them .In pursu geographi , Mr. Yapa nearli fell into the trap of what is call statu quo bia .Peopl gener dont like chang ,  said Alain Samson , a behavior scienc consult and editor of the Behavior Econom Guid . It human to go down the path of least resist and stick to what we know best. While the narrowest definit of thi bia is individu behavior that involv inertia or avoid of chang , it is also a tendenc that can influenc children to follow their parent into the same line of work .It is import to keep long-term happi in mind , becaus anoth bia can lead to an overemphasi on the next few year rather than the next few decad .Mani of us avoid action that are costli in the short term , even if they present payoff in the futur ,  Mr. Samson said . In behavior econom , thi is call present bias.He ad , The younger you are , the more difficult it is to think about the future.Present bia could prevent someon from pursu a job that requir an initi invest in educ , Mr. Samson said . The bia could also encourag a person to choos a job that offer high pay initi , but ha limit opportun for advanc .To combat these bias , economist suggest speak to profession in variou stage of a career . Experienc mentor can offer a longer-term perspect on what it will be like to work in that area for most of your life ; younger worker can offer a view of what it like to start in the field now .Thi kind of investig , economist say , will help job hunter avoid anoth seriou mistak : make choic base on the most obviou factor .Behavior econom tell us that peopl often focu too much on the wrong thing , and tend to focu on aspect of the job that are salient ,  said Alan Krueger , a professor of econom and public affair at Princeton Univers . So , for exampl , the pay is salient , especi the start pay.When make decis under thi salient bia , peopl may place more import on visibl or quantifi featur , such as the Corvett a lawyer drive , without consid the less readili visibl , such as how satisfi that lawyer may be with hi career .One of the thing we know from behavior econom is that social interact are veri import ,  Mr. Krueger said . Do peopl feel like theyr treat fairli ? Do they get along with the peopl they work with ? I think that an aspect of the job peopl should focu on to a greater extent . Do they find the work intrins reward ? Richard Freeman , a professor of econom at Harvard Univers , advis student to explor the world hands-on as much as they can through internship or a gap year . He suggest that if student do not like what they find that way , they could tri a differ employ or anoth job in the same field to see if that help .Lesli Stevenson , the director of career servic at the Univers of Richmond , suggest that student should visit the career center at their univers as earli as their freshman year .The good news is that peopl can chang their mind even after they get their degre  someth Mr. Yapa is thank he did . Ms. Stevenson also said graduat should not be afraid to call career offic after graduat , as mani offer servic to alumni . We encourag student to view career manag as part of an ongo process ,  she said .In the end , outwit your bias might mean learn to follow your gut feel and to keep listen .

Time magazin pile up around her apart and gather dust after she bought a subscript simpli becaus it came with an offer for extra point . And she ha increas the amount of time she spend shop on the Internet becaus merchant offer incent onlin for cardhold that are not avail in store .I havent paid for a trip on Southwest in year ,  say Ms. Falcon , which may be technic true , but a host of econom and social scienc research suggest that consum tend to spend more use plastic than they ever would with actual cash .Incent like frequent-fli mile or reward point onli amplifi a temptat that bank and financi servic compani have been profit from for decad .When you vari the payment method , peopl are will to pay more ,  said Duncan Simest , a professor of market at M.I.T . who publish a landmark paper on the subject in 2001 . Your not fork over a dollar bill , so there is less sensat of loss.With M.B.A. student as the subject , Mr. Simest and a colleagu , Drazen Prelec , held an auction of ticket to basketbal and basebal game featur two local team , the Boston Celtic and the Boston Red Sox .Some particip were told they would have to pay by credit card , other were inform that onli cash would be accept .When credit card were an option , the M.B.A. student offer to pay roughli twice as much as they were will to hand over in cash for the same ticket .The most surpris thing wa the size of the effect ,  said Mr. Simest , who titl the result paper Alway Leav Home Without It : A Further Investig of the Credit-Card Effect on Willing to Pay. He ad that while it wa not unusu to see spend pattern shift by 5 or 10 percent in experi , you dont see too mani exampl where peopl offer doubl what they would have otherwise.But the eas of buy with plastic , or what market call friction-fre spend ,  is onli half the stori . Social scientist have also found that consum have been condit by even the sight of credit card logo to want to spend more .Unlik Mr. Simest , who creat an experi from scratch , Richard Feinberg of Purdu Univers persuad restaur near campu in West Lafayett , Ind. , to let him studi actual patrons spend habit .Mr. Feinberg place credit card logo and symbol on some tabl and left other without them , as normal .

Just as Pavlov found that dog would saliv when they heard tone that were associ with food , peopl have been condit to associ credit card with spending.Although tool like Appl Pay and other mobil payment method are too new to have gener much academ research , or allow the kind of condit that half a centuri of credit card use ha produc , Mr. Feinberg suggest a similar dynam could be at work .The less friction there is , the easier it becom to spend ,  he said . Just stand at Starbuck and watch how mani peopl there use their smartphon to buy a latte.Speak of latt , credit card also encourag peopl to pay more for everyday item than they might otherwis , accord to Scott Bilker , founder of debtsmart.com and the author of Talk Your Way Out of Credit Card Debt.Pay $ 5 for a coffe might seem like a lot if you onli have $ 10 in your wallet ,  he said . But if your credit card ha a $ 10,000 limit on it , it doesnt seem like much.The key , said Greg McBride , chief financi analyst at Bankrate.com , a person financ websit , is to tri to exercis the same disciplin with plastic that you would with cash , despit the urg to splurg .If you cant help yourself , or occasion do have to carri a balanc , avoid incent card at all cost . They onli work for consum who pay their balanc in full ,  he said , as Ms. Falcon doe scrupul each month .For the 60 percent of consum who cant pay off what they owe each month , a much smarter bet would be to seek out the card with the lowest possibl interest rate .Of cours , even the best card rate are still high  the typic consum today ha $ 2,200 in credit card debt , with an averag annual interest rate of nearli 16 percent , accord to Bankrate.com .Doe that mean consum should cut their card up , stick to cash the way our great-grandpar had to and embrac the supposedli tradit valu of thrift ?It not that simpl today , nor wa there realli ever a golden age when American bought onli what they could truli afford , said Lendol Calder , a professor of histori at Augustana Colleg in Rock Island , Ill .The river of red ink ha run through American histori from the begin ,  said Mr. Calder .

Money goe into an H.S.A . tax-fre , grow tax-fre and is withdrawn tax-fre , if spent on elig medic cost .Yet some peopl find it difficult to commit to build up an H.S.A . to save for health need . At the end of last year , there were nearli 17 million account with balanc total more than $ 30 billion , accord to the H.S.A . track firm Devenir . But most of the money sit in save account , pay anem interest rate ; just 14 percent of the total wa in invest account with more growth potenti ( and , of cours , the possibl of loss ) .H.S.A. have been around for more than 10 year , but mani still confus them with workplac flexibl spend account , or F.S.A. , anoth tax-favor save tool . F.S.A. are avail onli through employ . Worker cant take the money with them if they chang job , and they cant invest the fund ; the account are meant to be spent on current cost , and in some case the fund are forfeit if they arent spent by an annual deadlin .Some saver may not have the minimum balanc need to invest , or may need money now to pay for care ; some may not like the invest option their H.S.A . offer . But it frustrat that mani peopl arent use the account to their full potenti , said Laura Scharr-Bykowski , a financi planner in Columbia , S.C .That money will never be tax ,  she said . Whi wouldnt you want to max out that gift the I.R. . ha given you ?The reason are like to includ not onli a lack of understand about how the account work but also mental or emot stumbl block . While save for retirement in a 401 ( k ) or an I.R.A . may evok pleasant imag of travel , hobbi and time spent with grandchildren , save for medic cost might inspir a sens of dread , said Michael Herndon , vice presid of financi resili with AARP .Marti Martin , a psychologist in Chicago who counsel client of the Plan Center , a financi plan firm , said one factor in save for the futur wa hyperbol discounting  the tendenc to favor smaller reward now over potenti larger reward in the futur . Theyd rather spend money on what here today ,  he said .An individual perceiv vulner ,  or percept of risk , come into play , too : Your less like to save for someth that you think wont happen ,  he said . Often , it not until peopl have a health scare themselv , he said , or see a famili member have one , that the possibl of futur health cost hit home .The uncertainti of just how much peopl may need to spend is anoth barrier .Peopl dont feel like they can predict their health care need ,  said Eric Dowley , senior vice presid of the H.S.A . busi at Fidel .Fidel attempt each year to project health care cost in retir , and the estim can be daunt . Fidelity latest estim is that an averag heterosexu coupl retir in 2015 at age 65 will need $ 245,000 to cover health cost in retir , if they have health coverag under tradit Medicar . ( The estim assum the man live to age 85 and the woman to age 87 ; it doesnt includ dental servic or long-term care ) . Other estim of health cost in retir are even higher .To help consum get an idea of how much they should target for save long-term , financi advis suggest two onlin calcul , theAARP health care cost calcul , prepar with OptumHealth Financi Servic , and Live to 100 ,  a life expect tool .A health save account is avail to employe and independ worker , and the money follow worker from one job to anoth . There no use it or lose it deadlin with an H.S.A . and , while the money can be spent on current cost , it also may be save for long-term expens becaus it roll over each year , an aspect that financi planner prefer .Howev , onli peopl with specif kind of health insur can contribut to an H.S.A . The account must be pair with health plan that meet strict criteria , includ a high deduct ( at least $ 1,300 for an individu and $ 2,600 for a famili , in 2016 ) , and an out-of-pocket maximum of no more than $ 6,550 for an individu and $ 13,100 for a famili .Ms. Scharr-Bykowski said that even client who could afford to do so often resist her advic to pay for current health cost with other fund and let the H.S.A . grow .User also dont realiz , planner say , that they can reimburs themselv from the account in the futur for cost incur today .Limit on annual contribut to health save account are rel low . For 2016 , the maximum contribut is $ 3,350 for an individu and $ 6,750 for a famili . ( Peopl age 55 or older can add an extra $ 1,000 as a catch-up contribut . )If H.S.A . money is spent on nonhealth care need befor turn 65 , youll pay a 20 percent penalti on the fund spent , in addit to regular incom tax . But after age 65 , the penalti goe away , and fund , then taxabl , can be spent on nonhealth need .If you look at estim of retir health care cost as be in the quarter-million-dollar rang , it hard to think you could oversav for that ,  said David Arm , a financi planner special in health care in Long Beach , Calif .', 'Abbott agre on Thursday to acquir St. Jude Medic for $ 25 billion , bring togeth two manufactur of devic for cardiovascular diseas .In combin the two , Abbott and St. Jude Medic will captur a larger posit across the market for cardiovascular devic , the two Midwestern compani said in a news releas .

Whi ?Origin are import becaus they brand your network . There is no taglin , there is no market campaign that will ever work for a network that is as good as show your perform .The stori line of WGNA four origin program span the Salem witch trial ( Salem ) , the secret race to build the world first atom bomb ( Manhattan ) , a clan of outsid live off the grid in Appalachia ( Outsiders ) and a group of slave escap a Georgia plantat ( Underground ) . Whi these stori today ?We want to go after American theme . Now , there is a marketer reason for that , and that is , especi when you are our size , especi when you are tri to make a mark , you want to make sure that you are target the biggest cross section of peopl to go after .The number of script show avail is expect to pass 400 thi year . Is there too much TV ?There is too much mediocr TV , but there is never enough qualiti TV .The Underground premier rank as the most-watch program in nearli 18 year on WGN America , with 5.7 million total viewer across the week . How did you attract such a larg audienc ?We did screen in black univers , megachurch and with the White Hous . We screen in certain museum . The most import thing that we need to get go on the show wa word of mouth and the approv of unbias audienc , not a profession audienc , not Hollywood premier , not New York premier , but premier in Middl America .You recent announc that Tribun had hire financi advis and is explor a possibl sale or strateg partnership for some or all of the company asset to unlock value. What the latest ?Look , it is our job everi day to maxim the valu of the asset . It earli on in the process .

I think thi bring our asset into focu , it bring what we are do into focu , and it kind of creat a process by which we think that valu should get recogn .Tribune stock ha declin about 45 percent in the last year , amid broader fear about the role of tradit TV in a digit world . Major concern includ sharp rate declin , a weak ad market and so-cal cord cut . What is the role for tradit televis in a digit world ?First , I would clearli categor a lot of it as overreact . Let just deal with the fact . At the end of the year , cord cut wa less than 1 percent versu the year befor . So if you have 99.5 percent or 99.4 percent of peopl stay with cabl , it is pretti slow eros . Two , when you look at what is go on with rate , clearli rate are chang .The busi which are current more vulner are the matur one that have been there , done that ,  wherea when you look at where we are , we are outsid . In the first quarter , our rate were up over 40 percent , so our trajectori is much higher .Is Netflix kill TV ?No . No . No . Absolut not . In some way , mayb , it is grow TV .You look at their top show , and the top one will get between three and six million view over the cours of 30 day . Outsiders and Underground did between 5.5 and 5.7 million viewer in seven day [ on tradit televis . ] God onli know what happen when someon decid to bing . So here we are , a nascent network , go toe-to-to with the biggest show , the biggest behemoth , and wer abl to get somewhat equal viewership . I think that say if you continu to put on provoc program , broadcast and cabl televis will be quit healthi .Did you just call Netflix the biggest behemoth ? That interest becaus until onli recent , they were consid an upstart .I use that in quot . Everyon is look for a boogeyman in the media environ , and I just think we all need to stick to our knit .On your watch , Tribun ha made a big push into the data busi . What is the power of that data ?Without give away too mani trade secret , the question befor everyon are : Is music a frontier for televis ? How do you get sport inform out there in an effect , compel manner ? How do you creat rock-solid , predict recommend ?What will the televis busi look like in five year ?I am so not a prognost , but so what I will do to answer your question and avoid prognost , I will go back to a turn of phrase which hasnt been use in a while : You will be abl to watch what you want to watch , when you want to watch it , where you want to watch it .

On the other , the economy expans continu to be lacklust : The pace of growth in the first quarter wa the slowest in two year .Both yardstick contain a measur of truth . And the explan is the appar lack of improv in product  the output of individu worker  despit dazzl advanc in Silicon Valley , America technolog frontier , and a continu econom recoveri that is near it seventh anniversari .For now , at least , mani busi , are find it more advantag to hire more worker than to invest in new technolog or equip to increas output and meet grow demand .In the short term , thi could be seen as a posit , especi with million of American just now come back into the job market after be sidelin dure and after the Great Recess .But in the long term , thi phenomenon threaten to undermin the nation prosper , said Michael Gapen , chief Unit State economist at Barclay .Economist view product growth and technolog chang as drive improv in standard of live over time ,  Mr. Gapen said . A perman slowdown in product growth would suggest that live standard rise more slowly.He note that product had been increas at an annual rate of about half a percentag point over the last five year . That is well below the Internet-driven 2.5 percent gain record annual in the second half of the 1990 , and below the more typic 1.5 percent rate of product gain in previou decad .We can tell stori about whi it so weak , but nobodi realli know ,  Mr. Gapen said . I think product growth can rebound , but the fear is that it wont.Whatev the answer , it clear that busi have grown much more wari of new invest recent , and the clearest evid of that ha emerg in the last two quarter .Much of the recent downturn in busi spend is a result of much lower price for oil , metal and other commod , and fear of a slowdown in China and elsewher around the world that are put a crimp on invest opportun .It doesnt look like there ani danger of recess , but the global economi and commod are weak ,  said Kevin Logan , chief Unit State economist at HSBC .

And over all , the growth in the Unit State ha been lacklust ever sinc the nation pull out of recess in 2009 .After a shaki start to thi year , the stock market ha rebound and energi price have stabil , provid some comfort to the oil industri , which ha undergon big cut in hire and invest in Texa , Oklahoma and other oil patch area .Recess fear , which domin the headlin and fixat trader on Wall Street three month ago , have larg fade .

Competitor from differ countri come togeth as one wa a way to make Thoma more cultur awar .Thi stori is a way to help him understand that there is a bigger world out there ,  Mr. DAlleva said .Attribut : driven to achiev and make progress.Most of the exist locomot have name that are basic ( Edward , Emili , Sam ) or sound British ( Fergu , Duncan , Berti ) . So Yong Bao stand out right away . China ha becom a crucial growth market for the franchis .Three year ago , we werent even in China ,  Mr. DAlleva said . Now it the second-largest territori for us ,  behind the Unit State , with Britain fall to third .Attribut : show no fear ,  happi to help out.She is the first one who can take on Thoma in term of be the fastest engin ,  Mr. DAlleva said .

How doe Thoma develop a relationship with someon who look veri differ from him and in some case can do thing better than he can ? Attribut : proud ,  alway wear a smile.If Carlo seem to have a Frida Kahlo-styl unibrow , that may be intent . Mattel went to great length , Mr. DAlleva said , to make sure each new charact had a color palett and person reflect of a particular country cultur .

But they dont yet own a home .Instead , they collect pay nearli $ 2,000 simpli to servic their student debt . Their next-largest monthli expens is the rent on their apart in Union Citi , N.J .It a rough realiti ,  said Ms. Danner , a 26-year-old analyst for Fidel , who graduat from Montclair State Univers with $ 85,000 in loan , more than doubl the nation averag . We definit want to buy a hous in the near futur , and we certainli want to have kid in the next coupl of year ,  she ad . But when you look at the initi monthli payment , it is stagger . It is hard to plan for the future.So she said she wa thrill to learn of a new perk that her employ made public last week : Fidel will appli up to $ 2,000 annual to the princip of it employees student debt . In Ms. Danner case , that will shave four year off her repay period , bring it to roughli eight year from 12 .Fidel is one of the more promin employ to announc the student loan repay benefit in recent month , a polici that seem like to gain traction . The benefit help address what some employ describ as a challeng attract and retain younger worker , mani of whom cant see beyond the burden of their student debt . Most employ that are offer the new perk also cap their cost at , say , $ 10,000 total per employe .Beyond Fidel , a varieti of organ  includ PricewaterhouseCoop , Natixi Global Asset Manag and Nvidia  have alreadi either announc plan or start offer the payment . Sever smaller compani  LendEDU , CommonBond , SoFi , Chegg and ChowNow  are also provid the benefit . The feder govern , howev , may be the pioneer here , have offer a repay program to select employe for mani year .And the list is grow . The hand of compani that administ the benefit behind the scene  Tuition.io , Gradifi and EdAssist among them  said demand wa rise . Tim DeMello , Gradifi chief execut , said hi firm wa in talk to bring about 100 more employ aboard thi year , and ha sign 26 letter of intent .While thi is all welcom news , the benefit are just anoth symptom of the underli problem : Tuition ha been rise faster than wage and inflat for decad , accord to the Colleg Board . But now that younger worker  or those born from about 1981 to 1997  have surpass Gener X as the largest share of the American work forc , accord to a Pew Research Center analysi of Censu Bureau data , it appear that employ are begin to hear their concern .Retir benefit , even incred gener packag , did not reson with younger worker at Fidel . Nor did potenti recruit find them tantal . Yet Fidel happen to have a 401 ( k ) match that made thi Gen X-er mouth water : Worker who contribut 7 percent of salari receiv a match of 7 percent , for a total of 14 percent . And if the compani perform well , it will sweeten that with profit-shar of up to 10 percent more  for a total of , ye , 24 percent of salari . That retir save made easi .But for younger worker , the dead weight of their student debt eclips all els . We were surpris to hear , loud and clear from employe and their manag , that a key concern wa student loan ,  said Jennif Hanson , head of associ experi and benefit at Fidel . It wa more acut than we realiz , and we heard peopl were put off real-lif transit  buy a home , get marri , have a babi . Given that we are all about plan , guidanc and save for the futur , it wa a real issue.So after speak with employe , Fidel decid it want to be seen as a trailblaz , larg to attract and retain talent . At the same time , the compani more than doubl it paid parent leav polici ( to 16 week for new mother , and six week for all parent ) .Under the student loan repay program , Fidel will appli up to $ 2,000 a year  or nearli $ 167 a month  toward an employee student loan princip , up to $ 10,000 total . More than 5,000 employe , or about 11 percent of it work forc , have sign up sinc Januari . Tuition.io , a compani base in Santa Monica , Calif. , collect the payment and send them directli to the loan servic . It also give worker guidanc on which loan to pay off first .I cant make predict ,  said Betsi Dill , a partner and leader in the well advisori practic at the consult firm Mercer . But if I could , I would say base on the level of interest , I think we are go to see more repay program .There are sever piec of feder legisl , in variou stage , that could encourag more employ to help chip away at their employees student debt . Right now , an employer contribut to the student loan is tax as incom to the worker . That make it less valuabl to the employe ( or the employ ha to contribut more money to provid , say , an after-tax benefit of $ 100 a month ) . Fidel , for instanc , want to provid at least $ 100 monthli on an after-tax basi , so it contribut $ 166 , which work out to $ 120 a month for worker who pay the most tax .But sever bill would make the perk tax-fre , up to certain limit . Other bill would go further , enabl employe to make their own payment on a pretax basi , up to a certain ceil .One propos , introduc by Repres Rodney Davi , Republican of Illinoi , and Gwen Graham , Democrat of Florida , would let worker receiv up to $ 5,250 in tax-fre payment annual , which is on par with the exist benefit for employ tuition reimburs . There a companion bill in the Senat , introduc in Januari by Senat Mark Warner , Democrat of Virginia .Element of the benefit appeal to polici maker on both side of the aisl , though it ha not yet gain widespread support . Republican like employ and tax cut and Democrat like educ , and an exclus from incom for employer-paid student loan repay assist lie at the intersect of the two ,  said Mark Kantrowitz , a student loan expert and publish of Cappex.com , a colleg comparison site .The financi impact for worker can be substanti . Consid an employ that contribut $ 100 a month to an employe  with a maximum benefit of $ 10,000  who is pay off a $ 35,000 debt with a 6 percent interest rate over 10 year . That would save the worker at least $ 2,213 in interest , and shave 2.5 year off the repay period , accord to calcul by Tuition.io .But that doesnt necessarili mean worker should focu sole on pay their loan at the expens of retir save . If an employ is offer a match on 401 ( k ) contribut , the no-brain advic is to take it . The match is free money ,  said Daniel Wrenn , a financi planner in Lexington , Ky. , who special in help physician and other highli indebt graduat .The repay program themselv vari across employ . But Brendon McQueen , chief execut of Tuition.io , said that mani employ were offer it to all employe . After all , there a swath of worker who are enter retir with student loan and plenti of work parent who have taken out loan for their children .There are restrict , howev . Natixi , for exampl , make the perk  up to $ 10,000 total  avail to all employe who have been with the compani for at least five year , but onli on their feder loan . PricewaterhouseCoop offer the benefit  up to $ 10,000  onli to more-junior employe . Nvidia , a comput graphic compani , extend repay to employe who graduat within the last three year , up to $ 30,000 total .But some employ may also begin to give worker a choic of how to deploy a benefit of , say , $ 100 a month . Mayb it dedic to a gym membership , a health save account or to a student loan payment . I think you will start to see more of that , where they are give the option to pick one of three ,  said Mr. DeMello of Gradifi .If that the case , here a suggest for the often-forgotten middl child , the Gen X-er who worri about pay a child colleg tuition : A $ 100 to $ 200 monthli contribut to a 529 plan would be most appreci , thank you veri much .', 'SOMETIM the hardest part of be a philanthropist is say no  particularli if the request come from worthi organ or equal well-heel friend .We start from a place of empathi ,  said Susan Wolf Ditkoff , partner and co-head of the philanthropi practic at the Bridgespan Group , a consult . It hard to say no to someon work on a worthi cause.But say no is sometim necessari , and how philanthropist say it can clarifi their mission and even help the reject organ .In some instanc , no come after ye . Carri Morgridg , vice presid of the Morgridg Famili Foundat and the author of Everi Gift Matter : How Your Passion Can Chang the World ,  said her family foundat often make three-year gift to group work in educ , health , the art and the environ .But she said she told organ at the outset that three meant three . Wer often ask , Cant you just do Year 4 ?  she said . We say , No , that part of our agreement. When we say no , we tri to guid them to the resourc in the other foundat and the other resourc in the sector.A no like that should be expect . Other time an organ can becom complac with the grant it get year after year . Rudolph G. Andrea , presid of the Andrea-Mennen Famili Foundat , said hi foundat had put organ on hiatu when they lost touch and then suddenli ask for more money as if they had been in contact all along .He said thi happen recent when he mention the lack of commun from an organ to the organization former execut director . Her successor call within 48 hour . He figur he would have never receiv that call had he not said someth .I took the posit that right now your out of the rotat ,  Mr. Andrea said . That the tough part when you have a relationship that wa great.Most of the time , though , the no come befor a relationship ha been establish .John Oddi , senior philanthrop director at Foundat Sourc , recent wrote Just Say No : The Art of the Turndown ,  a white paper that outlin the best way to reject request . At the top of hi list is to be direct but compassion with organ .Part of give them the news is allow them to feel like theyv done everyth they could  to the extent that you can valid their caus or their effort while at the same time say thi isnt a great fit ,  he said . You have to be firm but compassionate.Mariann Philbin , execut director of the Pierc Famili Foundat in Chicago and also a lectur on philanthrop issu , say that as hard as say no can be for philanthropist , it doesnt get easier with time .The earlier you can make a declin for legitim reason , the less pain it is for everybodi ,  she said . The sooner you can establish is there a fit here or not , the more respect you are of everyone time.The Pierc foundat , she said , focus on fund servic for the homeless in Chicago but more specif on make grant to help organ with oper expens . She said have such a specif screen limit most of the applic that would be outsid the scope of what it would fund .When declin are the most difficult is when an agenc is taken through a labori process that take up time from board member and staff and the C.E.O . and it still come out with a no ,  she said . It is much more difficult than work with a foundat that ha a veri fine screen at the front end so the grant seeker can find out sooner rather than later if there a real possibl there.Ms. Ditkoff said she had one philanthrop client who wa brutal honest in hi reject . He say , I dont want to beat around the bush . Thi isnt someth Id invest in . I could wast your time by send you to my execut director and wast her time as well.That kind of blunt isnt the norm , she said .Yet no , if present in the right light , can be help to an organ . Melissa Beck , execut director of Educ Foundat of America , which give money to art , environment and reproduct right organ , said she often focus on the reason behind a no and how it could benefit an organ .Wer dedic to the area we fund ,  Ms. Beck said . No is an opportun to strengthen an organization.No one benefit when there a gloss put on a reject ,  she ad . If the foundat is dedic to their strategi , have a realli frank strateg discuss could lead to a fresh conversation.And thi is where no might mean mayb or ye later . Charlen Wood , whose father start an amus park and sever restaur and hotel in the Lake Georg area of New York , said her famili foundat , Charl R. Wood Foundat , focus on organ support children , the art and health care within a two-hour radiu of Lake Georg . She said grant rang from $ 2,000 to over $ 1 million .When an organ that she like get turn down , she will often offer a suggest .Sometim , it a gray area and the board will discuss it , she said . Sometim , we go back to them and ask them to come back to us . We might ask them to come back with a children program.And how should the organ that ha been turn down react ?If someon say no , act gracious , and ask , What do I need to do to turn thi into a ye ?  Ms. Morgridg said . I say , Go to one of my other partner , have lunch with them and ask them. No is a soft no when done right.Then there is the no that come when philanthropist are ask by their friend or peer for donat to their own chariti . Mr. Oddi said thi forc the turndown to be more nuanc becaus it is a convers between what he call social and net-worth peers.For philanthropist with privat foundat , he often recommend they send the request to the board . When the request is reject , the philanthropist can blame the board .Of cours , thi tactic is fairli transpar . At that point , he said , peopl need to show they care about that caus or honor .You could say , The foundat wont support it , but Ill person come to the benefit where your be honor to show you that I care about you and your caus ,  he said . But make it clear that your not go to be ongo funders.Ms. Ditkoff tri to put thi type of give into perspect . Sometim , your go to say ye to someth becaus you realli care about it ,  she said . Or sometim , it a busi associ or an alma mater . Just name that and be honest about it.But howev they handl request , everi philanthropist ha to say no at some point . Declin worthi project is part of the packag ,  Ms. Philbin said .

The onli question now is whether it happen befor or after Yahoo annual meet .Starboard ha act forc , put up a slate to replac everi singl director . Typic , hedg fund nomin onli a short slate  two or three director  but given the state of Yahoo , thi wa not an option .For good measur , Starboard issu a letter that said mean thing about the Yahoo board . For exampl , Starboard said it wa extrem disappoint with Yahoo dismal financi perform , poor manag execut , egregi compens and hire practic , and gener lack of account and oversight by the board.But realli , after all these year of investor , competitor and comment treat Yahoo as a footbal to kick around , arent we all at thi point ?To be fair , the compani is tri . It is ad new two new board member , embark on new busi and tri to give the chief execut , Marissa Mayer , room to succeed on her chang busi plan , but patienc ha certainli worn thin .The comparison will be drawn between Starboard contest at Darden Restaur and thi one . In that contest Starboard propos replac the entir Darden board after the board vote to sell the Red Lobster chain against the wish of Starboard and other hedg fund that want to spin the compani off with the Oliv Garden chain .Sharehold vengeanc wa swift . Darden chief execut , Clarenc Oti Jr. , wa oust and the entir board wa replac . Oliv Garden , it should be note , ha had a nice turnaround sinc then  there is gold in those breadstick . )But it not quit the same situat . There you had an entrench , longtim , imperi C.E.O . who did not seem to be pay much attent to the core busi and seem more focus on draw a big salari . Darden appear to make no attempt to even speak with sharehold ( at least with those from outsid the compani ) . The fight at Darden wa over how to break up the compani , but for Yahoo it is simpli about the sale process .Here , Ms. Mayer is certainli listen , and though her salari is big she is certainli work hard to effect a turnaround . The problem is that she may be a great product engin , but that hasnt produc success at Yahoo , at least not yet . Time ha run out , though . It ran out when Yahoo itself chang it mind about it direct and decid to start a full sale process . At the time , Yahoo left open the option of be independ .But the directors nomin by Starboard cement Yahoo fate . Now , there is littl doubt that Yahoo will be sold .Yahoo board is like to be unseat in ani contest . Inde , one suspect that the reason the talk broke down is that Starboard , know it good hand , demand that a major of the board go .So thi is all come down to whether the board can cut a deal befor a sharehold meet , which will most like occur sometim in June .( You may recal , howev , that Yahoo postpon it meet in 2008 when it wa face with a hostil bid by Microsoft , so it may tri to buy a month or two by set the meet in Juli or August . At thi point , whi not ? It is like to lose the proxi contest anyway . )It a silli situat . You have Yahoo director tri to run an auction and reach a deal befor they are thrown out . You have a hedg fund race to unseat the board so it can cut the same deal . What is separ the two is that one group , the hedg fund investor , doesnt trust the other , Yahoo current director , to cut a good deal . In Darden case , the argument wa about what asset to sell and to whom .It not surpris  Yahoo board ha had a trust problem for year , one aggrav by perceiv misde over it possibl sale to Microsoft eight year ago . When Yahoo announc the chang in it spinoff plan , I thought that would buy the compani anoth year or so  Yahoo had listen to sharehold after all .But I underestim the trust issu . And now that trust problem is hurt the compani big time . The chatter among mani industri particip is that Yahoo is not take the sale process serious . Thi is of cours just gossip and should be dismiss , but it illustr the level of distrust in the market .Still , thi is someth that should be settl , perhap with Starboard get some particip in the buyout process . Certainli , the three differ invest bank Yahoo hire to run it sale process can help .But as with mani thing in the world , just becaus the path is easi and visibl , doesnt mean it will be taken . Yahoo the compani remain a pawn in it battl .', 'A juri in San Diego on Thursday reject claim by a law graduat , Anna Alaburda , that the Thoma Jefferson School of Law entic her to enrol by use mislead graduat employ figur .In the first  and perhap last  such case to reach the courtroom , Ms. Alaburda , 37 , argu that the school report a higher percentag of it graduat land job after graduat than wa actual the case , and that she reli on the bogu data to choos to attend the school .After amass more than $ 150,000 in debt to graduat in 2008 , she ha been unabl to find a full-tim , salari job as a lawyer , she say .A juri vote nine to three to reject her claim .Still , unlik more than a dozen other disgruntl lawyer who have tri but fail to bring their former law school to trial for count their graduates post-degre job such as waitress and bartend as full-tim legal employ , Ms. Alaburda surviv attempt over the past five year to sink her case .Thoma Jefferson stood by it employ figur . It lawyer , Michael Sullivan , argu that earn a law degre wa not a guarante of a well-pay job .Im not here to tell you a law degre is a guarante of career success , is a guarante of rich ,  Mr. Sullivan told the juri . It not . No degre is.At trial in San Diego Superior Court thi month , Ms. Alaburda said she chose Thoma Jefferson after consult popular law school guid , includ the 2004 edit of best graduat school by U.S. News & World Report . The San Diego school list said that just over 80 percent of it graduat were employ nine month after they graduat .I knew it wasnt as competit as first- or second-ti law school , but it still had pretti decent statist and wa A.B.A . accredit ,  she told the juri .So I thought it wa a pretti decent school to appli to.Other law school graduat , cite six-figur debt and mislead employ data , have tri to hold law school around the countri account .

Judici restraint is a doctrin long cherish by conserv and Republican , as well as mani judici scholar across the ideolog spectrum .Sinc Judg Garland sit on the Unit State Court of Appeal in Washington  in what is known as the District of Columbia Circuit  hi docket ha been heavi with appeal of decis by administr agenc like the Environment Protect Agenc or the Nation Labor Relat Board . In the overwhelm major of those case , he defer to those agencies decis . The Suprem Court justic whose languag hi most close resembl is none other than Antonin Scalia , the conserv justic whom Judg Garland would replac .Justic Scalia deliv a ring endors of judici defer to administr decis in a 1989 speech at Duke Univers 's law school . The legisl process becom less of a sport event ,  he said , when administr disput will be resolv , within the bound of permiss interpret , not by the court but by a particular agency.Of all the Suprem Court justic , Scalia wa the most outspoken propon of judici defer to agenc action ,  said Richard J . Pierc Jr. , a law professor at Georg Washington Univers and the author of the wide cite three-volum Administr Law Treatise.Still , the analog can be taken onli so far ; no one expect Judg Garland to be anoth firebrand in the Scalia mold . Justic Scalia wa the strongest propon of defer , but the weakest practition of it ,  Professor Pierc said . Judg Garland share the first of those valu and not the second. In that regard , he said , Judg Garland more close resembl Chief Justic John G. Robert Jr .( In a rank of all 35 Suprem Court justic from 1946 to 2011 base on friendli to business by two law professor , Lee Epstein and William Land , along with a feder appeal court judg , Richard A. Posner , Justic Robert rank second . Justic Scalia wa ninth . )Busi interest have a tremend stake in the next justic , sinc the loss of Justic Scalia end a five-to-four pro-busi major on the court that ha endur sinc the Reagan administr . Among issu of intens interest to busi expect to wend their way to the court are the statu of class action , the right of organ labor , employ discrimin , access to court and polit contribut by busi and labor .The District of Columbia Circuit get rel few explicit busi case ; far more end up in the Second Circuit , which includ New York . Judg Garland reput as a moder come primarili from hi rule in crimin case favor prosecutor and law enforc offici . But even those opinion can be view as show defer toward elect or appoint offici , which most law enforc offic are .In and of itself , the doctrin of judici restraint is neither liber nor conserv . The ideolog outcom depend on the particular presidenti administr and the legisl agenda to which a judg is defer . Justic Scalia remark at Duke came dure the earli day of the administr of Presid Georg H. W. Bush and just after the Reagan era of deregul , when administr decis reflect the mostli conserv valu prevail in those administr .Mani of Judg Garland recent opinion uphold administr action , includ numer appeal from Nation Labor Relat Board decis that have been interpret as favor organ labor , simpli reflect the ideolog cast of the Obama administration appointe to the board . Judg Garland wa also a feder appeal court judg dure the Georg W. Bush administr , when he appear to have been no less will to uphold agenc decis .Alarm by the pro-labor outcom in mani of these recent case , some have been quick to oppos Judg Garland confirm . The Nation Feder of Independ Busi said it oppos hi confirm becaus Judg Garland would be a strong alli of the regulatori bureaucraci , big labor and trial lawyers.But the small-busi feder is not exactli an imparti observ : It ha two challeng to the author of the Environment Protect Agenc pend befor the Suprem Court . The small-busi lobbi may well want an activist justic who it believ will rule in it favor , but that self-interest , not principl .Hannah Belitz , a student at Harvard Law School who contribut to the blog On Labor , analyz 22 Garland opinion involv the Nation Labor Relat Board and found that he side with the agenc in all but four . She acknowledg that while the languag of hi opinion speak repeatedli of a need for judici defer to agenc decision-mak , nonetheless the effect of that defer is favor to labor and unions. Her work ha been wide cite as evid that Judg Garland is a captiv of Big Labor.But sinc the Suprem Court landmark rule in Chevron v. Nation Resourc Defens Council  the veri rule Justic Scalia prais in hi speech at Duke  it ha been settl law that court should defer to most administr rule . Even the most conserv appeal court judg tend to agre .Nearli all of Judg Garland opinion were in unanim decis by three-judg panel of the District of Columbia Circuit , which includ mani Republican appointe and some veri conserv judg . In one labor relat board case , Judg Garland wa join by Judg Janic Roger Brown , a 2005 Bush appointe consid by mani to be a libertarian in the mold of Justic Clarenc Thoma . And Laurenc Silberman and David Sentel , two of the court most conserv judg , have lavish prais on Judg Garland .I dont see much signific in the N.L.R.B . case ,  said Professor Pierc of Georg Washington Univers . I read all the D.C . Circuit opinion . Iv alway thought of him as a moder and I still do . The fact that he ha rare issu separ opinion from hi Republican colleagu suggest he isnt strongli influenc by polit or ideolog considerations.In an exampl of Judg Garland approach that result in a pro-busi opinion , he side with bank and brokerag firm  and against consum advoc  argu that judg should defer to a Secur and Exchang Commiss rule that exempt broker dealer who provid fee-bas invest advic from the Invest Advis Act . The opinion is one of Judg Garland rare dissent from a major rule , which wa written by a judg nomin by Presid Bill Clinton .I spoke thi week with David Rivkin , a partner at Baker & Hostetl in Washington , a promin libertarian who wa a lead architect of the legal campaign to declar the Afford Care Act unconstitut . Judg Garland i an extrem impress lawyer and judg ,  he said .While Mr. Rivkin said he would like to see the Suprem Court impos greater constitut check on the power of the execut branch , he nonetheless agre that judici restraint and defer to administr author are not realli partisan issu .It all depend on who the polit master are ,  Mr. Rivkin said . Administr agenc can make bad decis that are both liber and conserv . Im realli surpris my progress friend seem so eager to confer thi boundless faith on the wisdom of bureaucrat . The next polit master could be Trump.Judg Garland ha drawn opposit from the left , though it ha been rel mute . The Democrat candid Senat Berni Sander said he would not have chosen him , and if elect presid befor Judg Garland were confirm , he would ask that Mr. Obama withdraw the nomin in favor of someon more progress . The Nation Organ for Women said it wa unfortunate that Mr. Obama chose someon whose record on women issu wa a blank slate. Mark Joseph Stern in Slate call him an extraordinarili disappoint choice. And he a Harvard-educ white man with a wife and famili . No divers there .Judg Garland judici philosophi on the appeal court suggest Republican senat should consid shift cours and confirm a bird in the hand .Judg Garland is an accomplish lawyer and a respect judg with a power legal mind ,  Tobia Barrington Wolff , a professor of constitut law at the Univers of Pennsylvania , said . He is also the most centrist nomine that the Republican leadership could reason have imagin from a Democrat president.\", 'Apple ambit to go head to head with Netflix and creat it own lineup of exclus movi and TV show ha long been the subject of much chatter and specul .But it first origin TV project  a nonscript seri about app  might sound more like a market campaign than a blockbust product .Appl announc on Thursday that it wa work with the entertain Will.i.am and two veteran TV execut , Ben Silverman and Howard T.

It would , howev , give the island certain crucial tool that bankruptci proceed can offer  but onli if it first come under close feder oversight and meet other condit .The oversight would be provid by a five-memb vote board , select by the presid of the Unit State from candid with expertis in financ , law or other relev field ; at least two would have their primari resid in Puerto Rico . The secretari of the Treasuri and the governor of Puerto Rico would also serv on the board , but would not have a vote .The board would have offic both in Washington and San Juan , and would have the power to subpoena document from both govern . It would audit Puerto Rico govern , improv oper , find save and ultim determin how much of the $ 72 billion debt realli ha to be restructur , if ani . The creation of such a board ha been highli controversi on the island , where some resid and offici have call it an act of coloni ,  and express some concern about outsid make financi decis  like budget cut  that could advers affect island resid .The rescu packag is primarili the work of Hous Republican under the direct of Paul Ryan , the Hous speaker , in consult with the Treasuri Depart and Democrat leader , includ Repres Nanci Pelosi , the minor leader .Like Puerto Rico , the Treasuri Depart ha been call for all of the island debt to be elig for restructur , no matter which part of the govern issu them .But while the Hous Republican draft the rescu packag have work close with Treasuri , they remain skeptic of Puerto Rico financi disclosur and want the oversight board to first audit each unit of govern , allow restructur onli in certain areas and where necessari ,  accord to a legisl summari review by The New York Time .The plan would also requir Puerto Rico to provid fair-valu measur of all pension asset and liabil , instead of the number now provid by actuari , which tend to underst the amount promis . Puerto Rico current report a pension shortfal of around $ 43 billion , but at fair valu the shortfal could be twice that amount or even more . Tell the truth about the cost of it pension plan would make it harder for Puerto Rico to mismanag the plan in the futur .The Treasuri had recommend that Puerto Rico give pension payment to retir govern worker prioriti over payment to bondhold , but lawmak reject that approach .Rearrang the exist payment prioriti would have seriou consequ on the broader municip bond market and exist creditor-to-debtor relationship ,  the summari said .Befor ani restructur of it debt , most it in the form of municip bond , the govern would first be requir to seek a consensu settlement in mediat . It would also have to issu up-to-d audit financi statement and balanc it budget ; Puerto Rico debt grew to it current crush size becaus for year it took out new long-term debt just to get enough cash to get through the year .If Puerto Rican offici are unabl to make the budget balanc with exist resourc , the oversight board would have the power to do it for them  which could mean cut in servic .On the other hand , Hous Republican agre with the Treasuri that ani restructur would best take place outsid of bankruptci . Give Puerto Rico access to the bankruptci court threaten to becom a constitut minefield . Instead of work through the bankruptci code , the lawmak devis a restructur framework under the Territori Claus of the Unit State Constitut , which give Congress broad author to write all need rule and regulations for territori .The legisl summari state that give Puerto Rico access to Chapter 9 i ill conceiv and would undermin the rule of law.Much of the rescu packag ha been draft in the Hous Natur Resourc Committe under it chairman , Rob Bishop of Utah . It jump into action after Mr. Ryan set the March deadlin back in Decemb , instruct the committe with jurisdict to come up with a respons solution by then .If the lawmak stay on schedul  a discuss draft is to be made public Tuesday  the rescu packag could be the first substanti piec of legisl to get traction in the Hous sinc Mr. Ryan wa elect speaker in Octob , promis to rejuven the legisl process by give the committe the lead in draft all major bill .Open the process ,  Mr. Ryan said at the time . Let peopl particip , and they might chang their tune . A neglect minor will gum up the work . A respect minor will work in good faith.Although the Natur Resourc Committe might seem an odd place to resolv an offshor financi collaps , the committe ha jurisdict over America territori , which includ Puerto Rico .The top-rank Democrat on the committe , Raul Grijalva of Arizona , yield hi posit in hear to Puerto Rico nonvot member of Congress , Pedro Pierluisi , also a Democrat , to give someon from the island a central role .A number of repres , all Democrat , who are not member of the committe also took part becaus they have close tie to Puerto Rico . Sever of them have said they thought the Republican were negoti in good faith , although they had not yet seen the draft of the bill .A court-supervis restructur would offer Puerto Rico some of the legal tool that bankruptci make avail . The plan , for exampl , would hold off creditor lawsuit while the restructur is underway , a central featur of bankruptci court .Chapter 9 is the part of the bankruptci code for insolv govern . Current , the code specif bar Puerto Rico from seek ani relief under Chapter 9 , and the governor and other offici have been call for an amend to chang that .On Tuesday , Puerto Rico went befor the Suprem Court seek the right to enact it own version of a bankruptci law . Justic were aggress in their question but seem perplex about whi Congress  in 1984  deni the island bankruptci protect .The Natur Resourc committe also ha taken an interest in Puerto Rico big electr power author , which is respons for about $ 9 billion of the island total debt . It appear to be insolv and is embroil in a scandal over improprieti in it purchas of fuel oil , it biggest expens .A summari of the rescu plan cite power cost as one reason peopl and busi have been leav Puerto Rico .', 'WASHINGTON  It seem like a chummi reunion between friend .

Then there wa the time he tick off Roger Ail , Fox power chairman , after chastis the host of the network morn show , Fox and Friend ,  for their carp coverag of Senat Barack Obama in 2008 .They were veri unhappi ,  Mr. Wallac recal . I had call them out on the air. He ad : There a phrase that we all talk about , which is , You do not fire insid the tent. That the ultim transgress in Roger Ailes mind.Over egg and tea here on Sunday , Mr. Wallac , whose Fox News Sunday is experienc it highest rate sinc start 20 year ago thi week , did not hesit to take hi industri and even hi network to task , say that Mr. Trump ha been grant too much exposur on cabl news .If we put Donald Trump on for a ralli now , and it go to spike our audienc , it pretti hard if your a news execut to say no ,  he said . Did everybodi do it too much ? Yes.Mr. Wallac singl out CNN as a notabl offend . Would he includ Fox in that group ?

The move to Fox prompt him to review what he call hi unexamin assumptions about tradit network news .If there a stori on same-sex marriag , it like thi is a celebr of a new civil right ,  Mr. Wallac said . Im not say I disagre with that . What Im say is there are two side to the stori , and I dont think , gener speak , the broadcast network will portray both side evenly.Wri and punchi on-air , Mr. Wallac ha long had a rebelli streak .

Mike Wallac onc stole an interview , with the comedian Chri Rock , away from hi son ; the two did not speak for sever month .Chri Wallac said there wa a time when Mr. Trump remark might have bother him , ad : It doesnt anymore.At some point , I realiz , I wa never go to be Mike Wallac , but neither wa anybodi els ,  he said .He and hi father , who die in 2012 , bond later in life ; Mr. Wallac ha also borrow bit of hi father interview style , prefac tough question with a polit Forgiv me ,  and occasion place a deferenti arm across hi chest .He a dignifi , smart , fairli quiet guy , who came up under a legend ,  Mr. Ail said in an interview .

Ye ,  Mr. Ail said , after a paus . On the other hand , it not just cabl news , but all news.The broadcast network are just as guilti ,  Mr. Ail ad , note that Mr. Trump , in addit to be the Republican front-runn , ha been more access to the news media than hi oppon . When you go tri to drag anoth candid to talk about anoth seriou issu that day , he not avail ,  Mr. Ail said .Andrew Heyward , a former presid of CB News , prais Mr. Wallac for hi tough interview and for refus to allow Mr. Trump to phone in to hi Sunday show , an accommod made by some other network .

Stream is up . Vinyl ha continu it unlik renaiss . And did we mention that stream is up ?But a closer look show that the big sale number that have sustain the record music busi for year are way down , and it is hard to see how they could ever return to where they were even a decad ago .Revenu from music sale in the Unit State ha hover around $ 7 billion sinc 2010 , accord to the Record Industri Associ of America . For 2015 , the number wa $ 7.02 billion , up slightli less than 1 percent from 2014 .Within that steadi total , howev , have been drastic shift in listen behavior . CD and download have been gradual abandon as stream ha becom the platform of choic .The result is that the music industri find itself fight over penni while wave goodby to dollar . For instanc , the grow but still special market for vinyl record is gener more revenu than the music on YouTub , one of the biggest destin on the Internet , but that becaus YouTub pay royalti in the tiniest fraction of cent .Stream  whether through paid subscript to Spotifi or Rhapsodi ; Internet radio from Pandora ; or even video on YouTub  now make up 34.3 percent of sale , edg out digit download as the industry biggest sourc of revenu . In 2015 , the year that Appl Music arriv and Tidal wa reintroduc by Jay Z , paid subscript servic gener $ 1.2 billion in sale in the Unit State . After ad in free stream platform and Internet radio , the total for stream is $ 2.4 billion .Get peopl to subscrib en mass to stream servic ha been a prioriti for record label and the stream compani alik , who have often claim that by build robust subscrib rank , they would eventu return the industri to it former glori .But so far stream ha not save the music busi , and deep worri persist about the model . Mani artist are suspici of the deal that their record compani have cut with technolog compani , and they want to know how much money is trickl down to them . In a rough analysi of the record industri association number , Billboard magazin estim that the averag amount of money gener each time a song is stream fell last year by about 24 percent , to 0.506 cent . ( The fine print : That number , a retail sale figur , cover so-cal on-demand stream , exclud Internet radio . )What get lost in the battl over fraction of penni , howev , is just how much money ha vanish from the music busi as consum have abandon it most profit product : the CD .In 2006  year after Napster , and well into the iTun era  record label still reap $ 9.4 billion from CD sale in the Unit State , more than the total sale revenu of the busi today .

( In respons , Googl , which own YouTub , object to it comparison alongsid audio-onli platform , refer to it as appl to oranges. )It may be possibl for the music industri to wring more money out of YouTub .

After a court rule on Thursday , he might have to wait even longer .I havent heard anything from the automak about a solut , said Mr. German , the owner of a 2010 Audi A3 diesel compact wagon in Ithaca , N.Y. Are they just lie low and hope thi whole thing goe away ? It a littl bit strange.Mr. German , execut director of a health administr program at Cornel Univers , is among almost 600,000 Volkswagen , Audi and Porsch owner in the Unit State who are stuck in limbo by the carmaker deliber cheat to violat air-qual regul .Volkswagen miss a court deadlin on Thursday to present a plan to bring the car into line with clean air rule , but Judg Charl Breyer at Unit State District Court in San Francisco gave the compani an extens until April 21 .If no agreement is reach with the feder govern , custom and dealer , a trial would be held thi summer to determin what measur Volkswagen should be compel to make and how much owner would be compens .Lawyer tri to reach a settlement said dure the hear that they had made substanti progress toward a solut . The engin are work around the clock ,  Robert Giuffra , a lawyer for Volkswagen , said dure the hear .As more detail have emerg about the hardwar and softwar insid the car , it increasingli look as if Volkswagen maneuv itself into a technolog cul-de-sac when it rig vehicl to cheat on emiss test , begin with 2009 model . Although the main culprit is softwar design to deceiv emiss test , simpli correct that softwar would not solv the bigger set of interconnect problem .The longer it take for Volkswagen to come up with a way to stop the car from spew illeg level of pollut , the greater the fine it is like to have to pay the Unit State govern . Car owner themselv face no legal jeopardi , but ani repair is also like to reduc fuel economi and caus part of the emiss system to wear out more quickli . That will hurt the cars resal valu , and rais the amount Volkswagen must pay the owner as compens .Some expert question whether it is even possibl to make the car in the Unit State conform to the law at a reason price . Those expert also cast doubt on the company assert that onli a few low-level employe were respons .There no way to fix these noncompli car ,  Bob Lutz , a former vice chairman of Gener Motor , said in a telephon interview . Mr. Lutz said he had long badger hi engin to match Volkswagen appar diesel effici , and now understand whi they never could .Peopl who have close examin Volkswagen engin technolog say that one reason the compani cheat in the first place wa that it engin were unabl to resolv a fundament conflict in emiss technolog , at least not at a price that fit their budget .Measur that reduc output of nitrogen oxid , which can caus lung ailment , automat increas product of soot particl , which can caus cancer .If Volkswagen had turn up the equip that reduc the nitrogen oxid , the addit soot output would have increas the need for the engin to period flush the particl filter by spray diesel fuel into the exhaust system . That in turn would increas fuel consumpt and rais the chanc the car particl filter would becom overburden and break down .That trade-off between soot and nitrogen oxid remain difficult and costli to resolv despit advanc in technolog sinc the diesel in question went on sale in the Unit State . In Europ , it wa not as big a problem becaus limit on nitrogen oxid are not as strict . The few rival compani who sold diesel in the Unit State address these challeng with more expens pollution-control technolog .Volkswagen , howev , wa intent on produc lower-cost , small car and wa in a major push to rebuild sale in the Unit State .In the six month sinc the Environment Protect Agenc expos the cheat , outsid expert have also analyz more close how Volkswagen manipul the softwar in the car to evad emiss control .Among them is Felix Domk , a self-describ hacker who live in Lbeck , Germani , who , on eBay , bought an exampl of the comput use by Volkswagen in it vehicl . He also examin the comput that came with hi own car , a Volkswagen diesel van .Mr. Domk , who said he work in inform technolog at a larg corpor that is not connect to the auto industri , first demonstr hi find at a hackers confer in Hamburg in Decemb , and elabor on them by email thi week .He show how the softwar adjust variabl like the amount of exhaust ga that wa recycl back into the motor , one of the method use to minim harm emiss . The softwar wa precis calibr to track the simul citi , rural and highway drive that car undergo dure offici test on roller in laboratori .Outsid the cycl  in other word , under actual on-the-road drive condit that regul would not normal see  the comput turn down the emiss control in a way that eas the burden on the particl filter , while also save fuel .Daniel Lang , a former inform technolog execut at the German carmak BMW who also spoke at the hackers confer , express skeptic about Volkswagen view that the softwar manipul wa the work of a small number of low-level employe .Softwar is heavili document and it is veri unlik that engin would have taken the risk of modifi the softwar without approv at a high level of manag , Mr. Lang said in an interview .It complet unrealist that a lone engineer would have been respons for the cheat , said Mr. Lang , who is founder and chief execut of Faster IT , a technolog consult firm .Volkswagen ha not explain who insid the compani wa respons for creat one of the biggest corpor scandal of the last decad . But in a German court file last month , the compani said that member of it manag board had no knowledg of the rule violation.The engin control softwar and onboard comput were provid by Bosch , one of the largest supplier of electron compon for the auto industri . Bosch ha been name along with Volkswagen as a defend in class-act lawsuit file by owner of Volkswagen-brand car .Bosch declin to comment on the lawsuit or provid detail about the way the engin softwar work , cite investig by the author .The Bosch softwar , also use by other carmak , can be custom for differ vehicl and motor . One question for the court will be whether Bosch share ani blame becaus of the rel eas with which the softwar could be use as a defeat device to evad emiss test .Anoth question is whi Volkswagen top manag never ask themselv whi their engin succeed where other had fail in produc rel inexpens diesel car that met American standard on nitrogen oxid , which are stricter than those in Europ .I wa beat up on em pretti hard ,  Mr. Lutz said . Theyr do it and we cant ? Nobodi could figur out how they were compli and their engin technolog is veri similar to everybodi elses.If Volkswagen is not abl to fix the car , there might be no altern but to buy them back , a solut mention by the judg on Thursday . To get owner to surrend the car , Volkswagen would probabl have to pay more than the market valu , ad to the alreadi enorm financi burden from the scandal .Mr. German , the owner of the 2010 Audi , who recent move to Ithaca from Austin , Tex. , said by phone that he would gladli accept the car at it prescand book valu , with perhap a littl extra to cover the hassl factor. Accord to Kelley Blue Book , an Audi A3 like Mr. German wa worth about $ 16,300 befor the emiss cheat becam known and about $ 14,370 now .I dont want my car anymor ,  he said .', 'Jason N.

If a sharehold speak up and suggest that manag stop invest in fax machin , manag should listen .Final , let consid who the major investor in these kind of fund are .They are teacher and polic offic pension fund , municip retir system , privat pension of larg compani with thousand of employe and endow fund of major academ system .Are these pension , these former teacher , polic offic and govern worker tri to sell America short ?

May the best idea rise to the top , whether they come from manag or sharehold . But thi bill allow manag to ignor the voic of sharehold .

In a recent USA Today/Rock the Vote poll , respond under 35 said they would pick Hillari Clinton over Mr. Trump , 52-19 . Those lopsid number would be hard to revers if Mr. Trump were the nomine becaus he is such a known quantiti . When the respond were limit to white onli , her lead wa still substanti , 45-26 . A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll show Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton essenti tie among peopl 40 and older , but with those under 40 prefer her by a nearli 2-to-1 margin . In a nation survey led by the Republican pollster Frank Luntz , 1,000 peopl 18 to 26 were ask : Out of today major polit figur , who do you like and respect the most ? Thirty-on percent chose Berni Sander , follow by 18 percent for Barack Obama and 11 percent for Mrs. Clinton . Mr. Trump score highest among Republican , at 9 percent . In USA Today , Mr. Luntz call it a a chasm of disconnect that render everi promin nation Republican irrelev with the vote bloc that could control campaign for the next 30 years. Among Republican , Mr. Trump ha retain popular with the young . He recent led the G.O.P . field at 26 percent among those 18 to 34 . But 26 percent wa lower than Mr. Trump support among G.O.P . backer over all . In look at all the avail exit poll from Republican contest , onli in New Hampshir wa there a consist pattern of rise support for Mr. Trump as vote group got younger . The more typic result wa North Carolina : 30 percent support for Mr. Trump among those 17 to 29 ; 37 percent among those 30 to 44 ; 44 percent among those 45 to 64 ; and 41 percent among those 65 and older .Mayb the young are more immun to Mr. Trump appeal to ethnic , religi and racial resent , as an Upshot reader , Staci from Manhattan , recent suggest :Recent research on race is far more pessimist . Sever articl last year poke hole in notion that younger white were post-raci ,  or significantli less racist than their parent . Write for Politico , Sean McElwe said millenni are racial apathetic and simpli ignor structur racism rather than tri to fix it.Jamel Bouie came to a similar conclus in Slate in 2014 , say young peopl were commit to an ideal of colorblind that leav them uncomfort with race , oppos to measur to reduc racial inequ , and a bit confus about what racism is. He wrote that a gener that hate racism but choos colorblind is a gener that , through it neglect , come to perpetu it.Nevertheless , it possibl that a gener that choos colorblindness is put off by more explicit racial messag , such as when Mr. Trump hesit sever time in disavow support from David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan .There a more obviou reason that racial messag could hurt Mr. Trump with the young : They are more divers . A Pew Research Center report in 2014 note that some 43 percent of millenni adult are nonwhit , the highest share of ani gener ,  and that the racial makeup of today young adult is one of the key factor in explain their polit liberalism.As an exampl , William Frey of the Brook Institut show Monday how rapid growth in the young Hispan popul in Arizona , a red state , could mean defeat for the G.O.P . there in Novemb .Republican had alreadi been struggl with young voter , so thi is not a Trump-onli effect . In the 2008 elect , Mr. Obama won 66 percent among those 18 to 29 , then drop to 60 percent in 2012 , accord to Pew . But ani sign of a youth trend away from Democrat seem to have been wipe out .The young are gener unimpress with the G.O.P . for some of the reason that make Mr. Sander so popular with them . The bigger concern for young peopl in the Luntz survey were incom inequ , colleg tuition and student debt , which dovetail with support for Mr. Sanders plan to increas tax on the wealthi and to make tuition free for public colleg . Respond also said they view social as a more compassion polit system than capit , by 58 percent to 33 percent . In a YouGov survey , those under 30 were the onli group that rate social as better than capit .Some Republican might take comfort in the thought that peopl becom more conserv as they age . But evid for that is unclear , and a statist model by Yair Ghitza and Andrew Gelman found that prefer in polit are typic set at an earli age , with last influenc .You can test thi find for your own polit view in a 2014 Upshot interact . The age 14 to 24 are the most form year for polit lean , accord to hundr of thousand of survey respons , and event at age 18 are about three time as power as those at age 40 ( the model work best among white voter ) .Thi idea isnt so differ from what market have learn : They often focu on make pitch to the young becaus older peopl have alreadi develop brand loyalti .The problem for the Republican brand is that a third straight elect in which the young vote decis for Democrat  even if the G.O.P . win thi Novemb  could imprint neg percept that last decad .', 'In Januari , I devot everi walk from my home to the train to the contempl of work detail , hope to improv my recal of them . That wa my New Year resolut , and so far Iv stuck to it .In everi one of those walk I wa also retrac a memor techniqu known to the ancient and shown by modern scienc to be highli effect .The Rhetorica ad Herennium ,  written in the 80 B.C . by an unknown author , is the first known text on the art of memor . ( It also the oldest surviv Latin book on rhetor . ) It teach the method of loci ,  also known as the memori palace. As it name suggest , the approach involv associ the idea or object to be memor with memor scene imagin to be at well-known locat ( loci ) , like one hous ( palace ) or along a familiar walk rout .You can test the method for yourself . If your like most peopl , you would not easili commit to long-term memori a 10-item shop list . But I bet you could rememb it  and for more than a few minut  if you first visual it along a walk through your hous : The entryway of your hous is festoon with toilet paper ; your kitchen sink is full of lobster , danc ; a bathtub-s stick of butter melt on your dine room tabl ; your famili is sing karaok in a swim pool of hummu in your live room ; your hallway is so full of grape you can not avoid crush them with each step ; your stairway ha a runner of lasagna noodl slipperi with tomato sauc ; a moo cow is be milk in your bedroom ; stalk of corn grow down from the ceil in the spare bedroom ; a crop of multicolor mushroom bloom in your shower .Take a few moment to burn these imag and locat into your mind ( ad motion , sound , smell and tactil sens to your imagin scene help ) . Well test your memori with an imaginari trip to the groceri store at the end of thi articl .Joshua Foer wrote a book about how he train to win the Unit State Memori Championship . He point out that wer so good at form mental map and recal imag that we hardli notic it . Recal the last parti you attend at a home you had not previous visit . Though you probabl onli walk through the hous a few time , you can probabl rememb most or all of it layout and locat of major furnitur . Anyth els distinct you saw  like unusu or appeal piec of art , vivid wall color  and the face of peopl you met are probabl also easi to recal . Effortlessli , you retain hundr or thousand of visual memori and spatial detail .Research back thi up . After peopl view thousand of imag for a few second each , studi found that , on averag , they could correctli distinguish over 80 percent of them from imag they had not seen . Thi remain true even when the comparison imag were of the same object in a slightli differ posit ( like the same cabinet open versu close or the same telephon at a differ angl ) . Anoth studi found peopl could usual recal object theyd seen even after see hundr of interven one , demonstr that visual memori of object are store long-term .It make sens , then , that numer studi , extend back decad , show that the method of loci improv memori . Use the approach , peopl who could rememb onli a hand of number  seven is the norm , give or take a few  were train to recal 80 to 90 .Anoth studi found that the method doubl the proport of peopl who could rememb at least 11 of 12 groceri list item . Student who appli it in an undergradu econom cours outperform those who did not on an exam . Medic student who use the method of loci to studi the endocrin system learn more than those who did not .Patient who have had treatment known to impair recal and cognit function  like coronari bypass surgeri and surgeri and chemotherapi for breast cancer  improv their memori with the method of loci . As a memori aid , it superior to rote memor and convert item to imag alon . Place those imag in a memori palac help recal .Befor book were common , the method of loci help lawyer and other retain and recal inform necessari for their job . The locut in the first place is a holdov from thi ancient method of memor speech . It work becaus it har humans evolv skill at rememb detail of locat , which help hunter-gather recal what wa edibl and where to find it , and what wa poison and how to avoid it .It doe not take an extraordinari mind to develop an extraordinari memori . Competitor in memori championship or those seen on Fox Superhuman  memori athlet  werent born with photograph memori . They have practic for year use the method of loci , supercharg with other mnemon method . With them , some can memor hundr of random number in a few minut or the order of card in a deck in ten of second . But , as Mr. Foer learn , memori athletes memori excel onli in area theyv train  they still misplac their key like the rest of us .Inde , scienc show that these are normal mind after extraordinari train  the same hardwar run differ softwar . Brain anatomi of memori athlet and those without except memori are the same . Becaus they have train specif to recal number and face , memori athlet outperform other in do so . But recal of magnifi imag of snow crystal  for which memori athlet have not train  is ident . After observ a game for five or 10 second , master chess player can recal the posit of nearli all the piec . A novic can recal onli a few . The differ is train , not except memori .

Howev , progress wa stymi for decad by resist from affect compani and regulatori inact .The new rule are the second major action taken by the Obama administr in recent month to address a long-known workplac hazard . In August , the Occup Safeti and Health Administr propos lower exposur to beryllium , an industri metal , to one-tenth their current level .Offici estim that the new silica standard , when fulli in effect , will save 600 live and prevent 900 new case of silicosi everi year .One of the basic bargain we make is that everi work person should come home safe at the end of the day ,  Thoma E. Perez , the secretari of labor , said in a telephon interview .Silica , which is a compon of sand and stone , is found in materi such as concret , brick , build block and mortar . Dure procedur like sandblast and frack or when build materi are cut , larg quantiti of silica particl can be releas into the air . Those particl can lodg deep in the lung , set off process that can lead to lung cancer as well as kidney diseas , in addit to silicosi .Under the new rule , permit exposur to silica throughout the construct industri would be cut to 50 microgram per cubic meter of air over an eight-hour period from 250 microgram . In other industri , which have a 100 microgram standard , it will also be reduc to 50 microgram .Compani will be requir , among other measur , to keep record of employe exposur to silica and to provid a medic examin everi three year to each worker whose level of exposur is high enough to requir wear a protect respir for at least 30 day a year . The new rule were first propos in 2013 and went through a two-year period of review and public comment .Compani have argu that voluntari step alreadi adopt , like the use of respir or vacuum that trap and collect silica dust , have sharpli reduc the incid of silicosi . And they have said the new rule would impos billion of dollar in new cost on them .In addit , sever trade group , like the Nation Industri Sand Associ , have question the health effect from chang the rule . Last year , in publicli file comment on the new rule , the group argu that OSHA had fail to show that reduc exposur limit to 50 microgram within industri alreadi cover by the 100 microgram standard would result in ad safeti benefit for worker .An estim 2.3 million worker are affect by the new rule , with about two million of them employ in construction-rel industri , accord to Labor Depart estim .In recent year , new worker have been expos to silica risk . In 2012 , for exampl , feder offici issu an alert about the hazard that worker face dure frack , a process that use sand to forc oil through underground rock .In a speech thi year to an energi industri group , Dr. David Michael , the director of OSHA , state that mani oil and ga compani were not meet the current silica exposur standard .We regularli run into employ who are not in complianc with the current standard ,  Dr. Michael said in a telephon interview .While other industri will have two year to conform fulli to the new exposur rule , the frack industri will have five year .Mr. Perez , the labor secretari , acknowledg that compani might sue the depart in an effort to block the regul .But he said he thought that mani compani would easili adapt to the new standard becaus inexpens equip is avail to control and trap the releas of silica dust .In the 1970 , when OSHA set the silica standard , the Nation Institut for Occup Safeti and Health wa alreadi recommend that it be reduc to the 50-microgram threshold .Thi is no differ than the stori of asbesto ,  Mr. Perez said .

And two of advertising most power men found themselv on opposit side in their assess of how big the problem continu to be .Two week ago , the chief commun offic for the J. Walter Thompson agenc file a lawsuit accus it chief execut of sexist and racist behavior , rais new question about gender discrimin and divers in the industri .When ask about the lawsuit dure a discuss on Tuesday , Mauric Levi , the head of the industri giant Publici , said the accus in the lawsuit were a one-man mistake and not indic of a wider problem . On Wednesday , howev , Martin Sorrel of WPP , which own J. Walter Thompson , sound a much differ note .There is a problem ,  Mr. Sorrel said by video confer . Mauric ha a habit of ignor the fact ,  he ad when ask about Mr. Levy comment .It wa a public reflect of what mani had been say privat throughout the week . Half a centuri remov from the era portray in Mad Men ,  the industry troubl with gender and racial divers ha onc again been thrust into the foreground .We need to do more to promot gender equal , so the agenc environ is safe , fair and someth we can all be proud of ,  said Nanci Hill , presid and chief execut of the 4A , the industri trade group that host the confer . Unfortun , the alleg behavior doe happen . And it happen more frequent than we think ,  she ad .While there are more women in advertis than in previou decad , includ some in the execut rank , the industri is still domin by white men . There ha been talk within advertis for year about improv gender and racial divers . But more press challeng stem from a widespread shift in how peopl consum media have domin industri discuss late .The lawsuit , howev  file by Erin Johnson , J. Walter Thompson chief commun offic , against the agency chief execut , Gustavo Martinez , who resign last week  forc the industri to publicli confront the implic of the accus .Ms. Johnson contend that Mr. Martinez subject employe to an unend stream of racist and sexist comment as well as unwant touch and other unlaw conduct ,  made numer comment about rape and , on multipl occas , grab Johnson by the throat and by the back of her neck.Dure panel and cocktail hour here , dinner and privat discuss , convers turn to gender and racial inequ . There wa disbelief that the behavior describ in the lawsuit could still occur in 2016 .When speak on stage , women urg the industri to address gender and racial inequ head-on . Ms. Hill said chang had to start at the top and that men had to be a part of the convers . In fact , you have to start the convers ,  she said . You have to listen to what your employe are say . You have to believ that if they dont look like you , they like dont feel or think like you.While Mr. Sorrel said there wa less gender bia at the junior level and mid-manag level , he also said that the percentag of women and other group , includ peopl who are gay , lesbian and transgend , at the senior level wa unaccept low.Wendi Clark , a top advertis execut who ha work at Coca-Cola and is now chief execut of the agenc DDB North America , said the industri had to stay restless on thi discussion and could not allow it to becom part of the convers onli when someth went wrong .Ms. Hill said that everi woman ha at least one story about sexism in the ad industri . She said men call her  young girl all the time even though she ha been work in advertis sinc the 1980 . In the 1990 , she said , a client suggest the onli reason she had hi busi wa becaus he want to sleep with her .Marian Salzman , the chief execut of the public relat agenc Hava PR North America who also start work in the industri in the 1980 , rememb a man onc told her , use crude languag , not to wear Ugg boot becaus they were unflatt . She said she also overlook mani comment that were , in retrospect , inappropri . She said she worri that she had not been sensit enough to other women who had complain of inappropri behavior , and felt she owe them an apolog . I didnt have my antenna up ,  she said .So while gasp and cheer erupt from the audienc when Mr. Sorrel call out Mr. Levy assess on the industry gender bia , their debat also subtli underscor the broader issu : It wa white male execut whose comment got the most attent .', 'SAN FRANCISCO  For week , the Unit State govern ha said that the onli way to open an iPhon use by a gunman in a mass shoot wa to get Apple help , a posit that set off a clash between the technolog giant and law enforc .But remark by a feder prosecutor in a court confer call on Monday and a letter from the F.B.I . director , Jame B.

While the government court file have paint a pictur of agent who had run through all possibl in open the devic , it appear that sinc the case becam public , they have been present with more option than publicli indic .Those option were partli the result of how atyp thi case ha becom .

Mr. Crocker said the public nature of thi case allow more peopl to be involv .On Monday , the Justic Depart said a third parti had offer a potenti solut for break into the iPhon without wipe the data from the devic . That led to a postpon of a court hear in the matter and a reduct of hostil between Appl and the govern .It is unclear if the third-parti method will succeed in open the devic ; the govern said it would present a statu report on ani progress by April 5 . If law enforc can not open the phone with help from the third parti , the Justic Depart may still ask the court to decid whether or not to requir Appl to help investig break into the gadget .The Justic Depart declin to comment . The agenc is not legal oblig to reveal that it ha been field more potenti solut for open the phone .Appl said it declin to specul on the F.B.I. method and action . The Silicon Valley compani ha previous express doubt that the govern could find no way to break into it iPhon , even as it constantli updat it secur protocol .Given the past exploit that have bypass the lock screen and the present-day realiti of innumer secur firm , malici actor , cybercrimin and potenti adversari of the Unit State constantli seek vulner ,  it seem improb for the govern to conclud that the onli way into the phone wa for Appl to write new code and weaken it secur , Erik Neuenschwand , the company manag of user privaci said in a recent court file .The F.B.I . ha tri mani way to get into the iPhon use by Mr. Farook , such as exploit a previou bug that allow unsign code to be load and run on the devic , Stacey Perino , an electron engin with the F.B.I . ha said in a court file in the case .The F.B.I . also tri tool made by the agenc and a mobil forens compani , Cellebrit , which let older iPhon load and run code that could crack a devic passcod , Ms. Perino wrote . Cellebrit describ itself on it websit as a subsidiari of Sun Corpor , a publicli trade Japanes compani ; it ha done work for a number of govern agenc .Yet none of those tool work , Ms. Perino wrote in the court document that wa file March 10 .Christoph M.

Larger comput monitor have also ruin smaller screen for mani peopl .So who would want a more petit iPhon ?Plenti of peopl , it turn out . Even though Apple newer iPhon skew larger  the screen size on the devic rang from 4.7 inch to 5.5 inch , up from four inch for older model like the iPhon 5 and 5S  more than 30 million consum bought the older four-inch iPhon last year , accord to Appl .Some peopl even plead with us to pleas keep the four-inch product ,  said Greg Joswiak , an Appl execut , dure the company product event on Monday .So thi week , Appl introduc the iPhon SE , a souped-up version of the four-inch iPhon , which will be releas on March 31 . The iPhon SE , put simpli , look and feel just like the iPhon 5S releas in 2013 , but it ha most of the gut of the iPhon 6S , which made it debut two year later .Reader had plenti of question about the small iPhon . Here are my answer to some of those that were most frequent ask , along with my impress of the devic after test it for a day .Doe the iPhon SE have all the bell and whistl of the iPhon 6S , just smaller ?  Joseph Kaplan , MarylandIt ha most of the bell and whistl , but some featur were left out .The iPhon SE ha the same processor ( call A9 ) as the 6S , mean it will be just as fast . ( In my speed test use the app Geekbench , the SE wa slightli faster than the 6S . ) The small iPhon ha the same superb camera as the 6S , along with the abil to shoot Live Photo , or photo that turn into miniatur video , and support for Appl Pay , the mobil payment system . The phone also support the same basic connect : the Lightn port for power cabl and a standard headphon jack for audio accessori .Howev , the SE lack a number of attribut of the 6S . It doe not have 3D Touch , the featur that let you control some softwar by exert pressur on the touch screen . The SE also ha a lower-qu front-fac camera ( mean your selfi will come out grainier ) and a slower fingerprint sensor compar with the 6S . Last but not least , from side-by-sid comparison , the SE screen isnt as bright or as vibrant as the 6S display .Whi were some 6S featur left out of the SE ?Appl say it left some of the 6S compon out of the SE larg to fit within the design constraint of the smaller bodi . Compon like 3D Touch would have ad thick to the devic , which probabl would have made it unattract .Will a new iPhon SE fit into the veri expens LifeProof case I have been use for my iPhon 5C ?  Robert Di Stasio , Vista , N.i .The SE will fit snugli in older case design for the iPhon 5 and the iPhon 5S . But case for other iPhon , includ the 5C , the color four-inch iPhon with a plastic bodi , will not fit the SE properli , accord to Appl .Is there ani advantag to buy the iPhon SE outright as oppos to go on an instal plan ?  Joseph Kaplan , MarylandYe , but onli for the sake of reduc confus , not for the sake of save money . The SE start price is $ 399 . On an instal plan , like AT & T ; s Next 24 plan , you could pay $ 13.30 a month for 30 month with the option to upgrad to a new phone after 24 month .If you want to avoid get lost in the maze of smartphon payment plan , I recommend pay for the SE outright . Do that will give you the flexibl of trade in your phone , and upgrad to a new phone or switch to anoth carrier , whenev you want .But if you dont have that much money to spend right away , instal plan are a safe bet becaus they incur zero interest fee , mean it make no differ financi to pay the full $ 399 upfront or spread out the cost over a year or two .Who is a smaller iPhon for ?A few categori of consum come to mind for the SE :1 . Obsess email or social media user who like the abil to quickli type or juggl between app with one hand . The smaller iPhon is better suit than larger phone for one-hand use . In my test , I could type the full alphabet with one hand on a SE about three second faster than I could on a 6S . On a 6S , use the phone with one hand is manag , but all the thumb-reach can becom tire when use app ; on a 6S Plu , type with one hand just isnt doabl unless your one of those giant in Game of Thrones.2 . Parent who want to buy cheaper smartphon for their teenag . The $ 399 start price for the SE is consider lower than the $ 650 start price for the 6S . If your look to save a few hundr buck by buy your children smaller iPhon , they probabl wouldnt loath you much . ( Becaus the SE front-fac camera isnt as good as the one on the 6S , their selfi will be a bit blurrier , but they probabl wont notic the differ if you dont mention it . )3 . Peopl who want to spend less time on their smartphon . The larger screen on the 6S and 6S Plu are enabl for long read session or YouTub stream . If you just want a smartphon for get in and out of quick task , like shoot off an email , the SE smaller screen can certainli make digit media less addict .I have an iPhon 5S . Should I upgrad to the iPhon SE , or wait for the iPhon 7 ?  John Erickson , NashvilHere where buyer advic come in . When I first heard about a four-inch iPhon sever month ago , I thought I would want to switch back to the smaller screen becaus I miss be abl to use the iPhon easili with one hand .But after take a closer look at the SE side by side with a newer iPhon , the biggest trade-off is the loss of detail in the SE display pictur . The SE screen look dimmer and the color are more mute than on the 6S , which significantli affect the experi of use the phone , for exampl , look at photo or read web articl . After weigh all the pro and con ( includ the featur miss from the SE ) , I person would spend a bit more on the larger iPhon and say goodby to the glori day of one-hand phone .But whether you wait for the iPhon 7 or upgrad now to the SE should pure have to do with your prefer for screen size . If you are marri to the four-inch screen , the SE is an excel upgrad from the four-inch 5S : The SE is extrem fast , take nice photo and , ergonom , is the most comfort iPhon to use in the hand and fit insid a pocket .If you think you are will to sacrific the benefit of a smaller screen and step up to a bigger one , then wait about six month for the next major upgrad to the bigger iPhon model . Appl typic announc new iPhon in the fall .What kind of reaction ha Appl gotten to the SE so far ?Im told Mr. Joswiak , who spoke at the Appl event about consum who were plead for a new small phone , got dozen of custom thank-you email .', 'COWGIL , Mo .  Up and down the center of the countri , wind rip across plain , ridg and plateau , a belt of unhar energi capabl of power million of custom , with enorm potenti to help meet nation goal to stem climat chang .And becaus the bulk of the demand is hundr of mile away , compani are work to build a robust network of high-voltag transmiss line to get the power to the coast .If onli it were that simpl . In all , more than 3,100 mile of project have yet to be built , in need of govern approv .One of the most ambiti project , call the Grain Belt Express from a compani call Clean Line Energi Partner , spent six year win the go-ahead in three of the Midwestern state it would cross , onli to hit a dead end in Missouri when state regul vote 3 to 2 to stop the project . They were sway by landown like Jennif Gatrel , who run a midsiz famili cattl oper with her husband , Jeff , here in the northwestern part of the state .She and other oppon made the usual argument against trampl properti right through the use of emin domain , obliter their pastor view and disrupt their way of life .But they also argu someth els : Whi should they have to live beneath the high-voltag line when there is plenti of wind in the East ?Now the whole project is wait , put the Gatrel in the middl of an emerg battl over how the nation should shift to renew energi and meet ambiti target in carbon reduct . The outcom will determin where and how green energi will develop over the come decad .We have thi potenti for high-qual renew in real volum for the first time ,  said Jame J. Hoecker , a former chairman of the Feder Energi Regulatori Commiss who now advis the transmiss industri . The problem is , where the best renew are , there are few customers.The transmiss line like Grain Belt Express , he said , would bring the electr to where there is demand .The push to enhanc the grid ha gain urgenc as renew have spread . Alreadi , electr system in area like Hawaii and Germani are under strain as wind and solar power fluctuat and overload the wire . What is need , propon say , is a new infrastructur better suit to handl renew energi .Energi Depart offici acknowledg as much , say that the Unit State must significantli upgrad it transmiss and distribut system to meet both the need of the inform economi and clean energi goal , an effort that would requir an estim $ 900 billion in invest by 2030 .A recent studi by the Nation Ocean and Atmospher Administr and the Univers of Colorado , Boulder , found that with such a network , the Unit State could suppli most of it electr with renew by then at cost near today price and get close to meet the goal set in the Pari agreement on climat chang .But oppon like Ms. Gatrel say that giant project like the Grain Belt Express repres an outmod , central approach to deliv energi . Just as it is healthier and more sustain to eat food close to where they are grown , the argument goe , so , too , should electr be consum closer to where it is produc .We believ that the East Coast ha access to abund offshor wind and that ani time you talk about green or clean , you should also be talk about local ,  she said . Unnecessari long-haul transmiss line are not our country future.It isnt just here in northwestern Missouri that construct of new power line ha met resist , and transmiss project can live or die at the hand of state and counti offici repres the local interest .Clean Line ha five project in the work , includ one that fail to gain approv in Iowa and anoth that ran aground in Arkansa and is await feder approv under a thus-far unus provis of the 2005 Energi Polici Act . TransWest Express , a connector that the billionair Philip Anschutz is propos to instal from the enorm wind farm he is develop on hi south-centr Wyom cattl ranch to La Vega , is also await a feder go-ahead .But some energi offici and execut say there is a more dynam and resili altern to these sprawl network . Instead , they are promot the develop of less central system that link smaller power instal , includ rooftop solar , storag and electr vehicl , an approach known as distribut gener .Conflict over those compet vision ha crop up across the countri in fight over both wind and solar develop , but nowher is that conflict starker than in Missouri reject of Grain Belt .The transmiss line , which could creat thousand of temporari manufactur and construct job in the state , attract strong support among some econom develop offici and landown . They saw it as a chanc to bring need revenu to local counti and school district , as well as to provid extra incom for those whose land it cross .Im want to make sure that my local district ha the asset to be abl to do what they need to do ,  said Wayn Wilcox , 68 , who run a farm that ha been in hi famili sinc 1884 and is a commission in Randolph Counti . I just believ a project like thi bring a lot of good to a community.But oppon flood the state Public Servic Commiss with thousand of comment against the propos . Among the object wa grant Clean Line emin domain so it could profit from ship electr to energy-hungri region that command higher power price . In addit , oppon say that the line can interrupt farm oper , pierc the countri quiet with hum or pop sound and pollut the night with a glow .And although the line are said to be safe , farmer are warn not to refuel vehicl underneath them , or if refuel is necessari , to ground equip with heavi chain .Michael Skelli , Clean Line presid and founder , said that the line would not glow , but acknowledg that most landown wouldnt be eager to have the tower , which could rise 150 feet , on their properti . He also said that the except wind of the Great Plain could go a long way toward reduc the country carbon emiss , and that the compani would compens landown for their sacrific . And sinc there is no comprehens , nation transmission-build program , he said , it wa up to privat compani to devis busi model to handl it .The difficult thing is that with infrastructur of ani type , it ha to go somewher ,  he said , ad , To motiv investor , there ha to be a possibl that they make money  otherwis , it not go to happen.The state five-memb Public Servic Commiss , which reject the propos by one vote , conclud that it prioriti wa Missouri , and that ani actual benefit to the gener public from the project are outweigh by the burden on affect landowners.One of the dissent commission , Daniel Y . Hall , who is now the chairman , wrote that the major had use an overli narrow and parochi interpret of the public interest that put the state on the wrong side of history.That debat is far from over .

Mr. Schiller ha stood hi ground . He ha not onli deni the charg but ha refus to resign from the Valeant board .It make for an uncomfort situat at the struggl drug maker . But Valeant is stuck .As you may recal , Valeant got a head start as part of the first wave of tax invers deal in 2010 , move it place of incorpor from Delawar to British Columbia , Canada , through a merger with a rival drug maker . At the time , sharehold seemingli cheer thi move to lower the company tax . Thi advantag allow Valeant to engag in a robust acquisit strategi that doubl it size .Unfortun , sharehold did not appreci that they were buy into a differ govern system . In some respect , thi is a not a signific issu for Valeant . The Canadian system is broadli more shareholder-friendli than the American one , limit takeov defens such as the poison pill , for exampl .The Canadian system is also broadli similar to the Unit State in term of fiduciari duti , though the potenti for liabil is a bit broader .Although the law is more favor to sharehold , it foreign will make it a bit more difficult for Valeant mostli American sharehold to navig thi morass . And it will mean that the litig over Valeant mess is not like to focu on whether the board breach it fiduciari duti . There is just not the system for sharehold litig in Canada that we have here ( make your own judgment on that one ) .Instead , you will get regular stock-drop secur lawsuit . The ironi , of cours , is that the hedg fund that now have Valeant board seat , ValueAct Capit and Persh Squar Capit Manag , will now be some of the biggest possibl beneficiari of thi litig ( which , if they win , will be paid in part by the compani , highlight the sometim absurd of secur litig ) .One thing that is broadli similar between Canada and the Unit State is the process for remov director . For compani incorpor in Delawar ( where most public American compani are incorpor ) , a director on a nonstagg board can be remov at ani time with or without caus . But onli the sharehold can effect a remov . They must act at either the annual meet or , if permit , at a special meet or by written consent .There is the possibl of a court do thi , but Valeant would have to show that Mr. Schiller pose an immedi danger to the compani by remain a director .The rule is similar in Canada . A Valeant director can be remov onli by sharehold either act at the annual meet or by special resolut .And so Valeant is stuck , at least until it next annual meet , which is like to be in May .Mr. Schiller is act in hi best interest . By stay , he ha a bargain chip with the board . He will want to make sure that Valeant honor the arrang to defend him in litig .It is not go to be easi for him , howev . Mr. Schiller ( and Valeant now depart chief execut , J. Michael Pearson ) may face pay clawback action .

Inde , for mani year Appl comput had far fewer attack than machin run Microsoft Window , but expert said thi had as much to do with the rel attract of tri to find flaw in Window , which had much more of the market .

The slump is attribut to a suppli glut set off larg by a build boom and by lower-than-expect demand from major custom like China .The move rais question on the viabil of other larg L.N.G . projects in Australia and elsewher , wrote Neil Beveridg , an analyst at Bernstein Research in Hong Kong , in a note to client on Wednesday .Wev got a glut of suppli come into the market at a time of weak demand ,  Mr. Beveridg said in an interview .Peter Coleman , the chief execut of Woodsid , which is base in Perth , Australia , said in a statement that decid not to go ahead with Brows , whose cost were estim at $ 40 billion , repres a disciplin approach to large-scal capit investment.In past year , with oil price in the $ 100 a barrel rang and L.N.G . price  which are often link to oil  also high , oil compani embark on a seri of enorm , costli project , figur that the revenu stream from the fuel would justifi the cost .Huge suppli of L.N.G. , which is natur ga chill to a liquid so that it can be transport on ship , are now come onto the market from Australia .

Other partner in the project includ PetroChina and Mitsubishi .Shell said in a statement : There are signific global factor in play which pose econom rather than technic challeng for the project.', 'In San Francisco , as in most citi , park is an expens daili grind that sap the soul . So a year and a half ago , when I discov the valet-park app Lux , the heaven part , choir began sing and doubl rainbow color the sky . Thi , I wa convinc , could be the next big thing .Lux solv park with an armi of smartphone-guid attend who park and retriev your car at the push of a button . That sound like a bourgeoi luxuri , but the real magic of Lux wa it underli econom . By ferri car from popular area to underus park lot , Luxe founder argu that they had discov a loos thread in the city park knot . It wasnt simpli more conveni  at $ 5 an hour , with a maximum of $ 15 for the day  Lux wa also significantli cheaper than just about ani other way to park .Thing have sinc chang , and not for the better . Lux is less reliabl , and price have gone way up . Where I park in San Francisco , Lux now often charg close to $ 30 a day , a rate that exce those of local lot , especi when you includ the app suggest tip for valet .Lux disput that there ha been a shift in it busi model or it target audienc . The compani say busi is boom . But the uneven servic and increas price rais larger question about on-demand app , the battalion of compani found in the last few year to get stuff done for custom in the real world , like food deliveri , groceri shop and park .Other than Uber , the hypersuccess granddaddi of on-demand app , mani of these compani have come under stress . Across a varieti of on-demand app , price are rise , servic is declin , busi model are shift , and in some case , compani are close down .Here is what we are wit : the end of the on-demand dream .That dream wa about price and conveni . Like Lux , mani of these compani market themselv as clever hack of the exist order . They werent just less headach than old-world servic , but becaus they were use phone to elimin ineffici , they argu that they could be cheaper , too  so cheap that as they grew , they could offer luxury-level servic at mass-market price .That just isnt happen . Though I still use Lux frequent , it now often feel like just anoth luxuri for peopl who have more money than time .So do a lot of other app offer servic across a number of industri . They are super conveni , but the conveni come at a premium , which seem here to stay . Some of these servic could make for fine busi , but it is hard to call them groundbreak . After all , pay extra for conveni isnt realli innov  it is pretti much how the world ha alway work .Befor we get to whi mani on-demand app have struggl to achiev mass-market price , it is import to rememb whi anyon ever thought they could : becaus Uber did it . The ride-hail compani that is valu by investor at more than $ 60 billion began as a luxuri servic . The magic of Uber wa that it use it growth to keep cut it price and expand it servic . Uber shift from a conveni altern to luxuri car to an altern to taxi to , now , a credibl altern to own a car .Investor saw Uber success as a templat for Uber for everyth . The industri went through a period where we said , let look at ani big servic industri , stick on-demand on it , and wev got an Uber ,  said Hunter Walk , a ventur capitalist at the firm Homebrew , which ha invest in at least one on-demand compani , the ship servic Shyp .But Uber success wa in mani way uniqu . For one thing , it wa attack a vulner market . In mani citi , the taxi busi wa a customer-unfriendli protectionist racket that artifici inflat price and care littl about custom servic . The opportun for Uber to becom a regular part of people live wa huge . Mani peopl take car everi day , so hook them onc and you have repeat custom . Final , car are the second-most-expens thing peopl buy , and the most frequent thing we do with them is park . That monument ineffici left Uber ampl room to extract a profit even after undercut what we now pay for car .But how mani other market are there like that ? Not mani . Some servic were use frequent by consum , but werent that valuabl  thing relat to food , for instanc , offer low margin . Other busi fund in low-frequ and low-valu area were a trap ,  Mr . Walk said .Anoth problem wa that fund distort on-demand busi . So mani start-up rais so much cash in 2014 and 2015 that they were freed from the pressur of have to make money on each of their order . Now that investor appetit for on-demand compani ha cool , compani have been forc to return saniti to their busi , sometim by rais price .Look at groceri shop . Last year the grocery-deliveri start-up Instacart lower price becaus it thought it could extract extra revenu from supermarket chain , which were attract to the new busi Instacart wa bring in .That ha pan out onli partway . A repres told me Instacart revenu grew by a factor of six sinc the start of 2015 , and it ha been abl to use data scienc to find effici in it oper . But the revenu from supermarket chain wasnt enough to offset cost , so in Decemb , Instacart rais deliveri charg to $ 6 from $ 4 for most order . It ha also reduc pay for some of it worker .The chang are in line with a drive toward profit . The compani said it had stem loss in it biggest citi , and aim to becom gross-margin positive  that is , to stop lose money on each order  across it oper by the end of April .Or consid deliveri servic . Postmat , one of the most establish on-demand deliveri start-up , began as a premium servic that charg extraordinari fee  50 percent isnt unusu  for the conveni of get just about anyth deliv anywher . That premium ha kept the company unit econom in the black . Postmat doe not lose money on the bulk of it order .But high price left the compani vulner to lower-pr competitor , includ the rel newer entrant DoorDash , which ha receiv pile of fund from Silicon Valley ventur firm ( the compani announc a $ 127 million fund round on Tuesday after struggl to rais some of the cash ) .Last year , Postmat began offer a cheaper servic in which restaur kick back some of the deliveri fee in return for the promis of more order ; that price is $ 3 or $ 4 for a food order , not includ a tip . But so far , that servic repres 30 percent of the company order . DoorDash , which charg $ 5 or $ 6 an order , ha a similar busi model , which charg restaur a commiss for each order .Is a fee of $ 3 to $ 6 for deliveri of groceri or food a mass-market price ? For mani peopl , the save in time is worth the price . But the median American wage is around $ 20 an hour , so a fee of even a few dollar is a costli premium .Instacart , Postmat and DoorDash say they see opportun for lower price as they grow . They are hope for effici gain that come with volum , like bundl two or three order in each deliveri .But it is wise to be skeptic of claim of futur price cut . Last year , Tri Tran , the founder of the food-deliveri compani Muncheri , told me he expect price for most dish on the servic to come in at under $ 10 a person . Today Munchery price are pretti much unchang . When I ask the compani what happen , I got no real answer from a repres .That bring us to Lux . A spokesman told me that the problem I wa see were caus by high demand . The compani is grow at 40 percent everi month , which ha caus hiccup in servic . Lux ha no further plan to rais price and think it current model can gener signific profit margin , and lead to lower price , as it scale .As a user , I hope so . But I wonder . The lesson so far in the on-demand world is that Uber is the except , not the norm . Uber , but for Uber  and not much els .', 'A thirst for revenu at all costs drove trader at Credit Suiss to take larg , riski posit , catch top execut off guard and forc them to acceler cost-cut over the next three year , the bank chief execut said on Wednesday .Credit Suiss is also plan to shrink it invest bank further .

And when hacker do find flaw in Apple code , they have littl incent to turn them over to the compani for fix .Googl , Microsoft , Facebook , Twitter , Mozilla and mani other tech compani all pay outsid hacker who turn over bug in their product and system . Uber began a new bug bounti program on Tuesday . Googl ha paid outsid hacker more than $ 6 million sinc it announc a bug bounti program in 2010 , and the compani last week doubl it top reward to $ 100,000 for anyon who can break into it Chromebook .Appl , which ha had rel strong secur over the year , ha been open about how secur is a never-end cat-and-mous game and how it is unwil to engag in a financi arm race to pay for code exploit .The compani ha yet to give hacker anyth more than a gold star . When hacker do turn over seriou flaw in it product , they may see their name list on the company websit  but that is it . That is a far cri from what hacker can expect if they sell an Appl flaw on the thrive underground market where a grow number of compani and govern agenc are will to pay hacker handsom .The disclosur by the Unit State govern on Monday that an unknown third parti had approach it  and not Appl  to help open a controversi iPhon onli highlight how the giant compani approach bug-hunt effort and secur differ from the rest of the tech industri .But secur expert , especi those with a stake in such bug program , said Appl could now be do more , especi in thi day and age where the convent of find bug and fix them have chang .Just thi week , research at John Hopkin Univers uncov a flaw that would allow attack to decrypt the content of photo and video attach in Apple iMessag program . The research turn that flaw over to Appl for patch .Especi with the stake be as high as they are , if Appl want to continu to compet in the modern world , they have to modern their approach ,  said Kati Moussouri , a chief polici offic at HackerOn , which compani like Yahoo , Dropbox and now Uber pay to manag their bug bounti program .The ident of the third parti that approach the F.B.I . with the possibl way to unlock the iPhon  which wa use by one of the attack in a mass shoot in San Bernardino , Calif. , last year  remain unknown on Tuesday . The emerg of the third parti halt , at least temporarili , a contenti case between Appl and the Unit State govern over whether the compani should weaken the secur of it iPhon to help law enforc .The Justic Depart ha declin to name the third-parti person or organ , or to describ the propos method for break into the devic . The third parti may not have approach Appl for mani reason .In the past , Microsoft system were a more frequent target for malicious-mind hacker , larg becaus of the preval of it product . But as Microsoft began to embrac the hack commun , it secur improv .As Apple desktop and mobil phone have gain more market share , and as custom began to entrust more and more of their person data to their iPhon , Appl product have becom far more valuabl mark for crimin and spi .An Appl spokeswoman refer to an editori by Craig Federighi , the company senior vice presid for softwar engin , in which he wrote , Secur is an endless race  one that you can lead but never decis win.Our team must work tirelessli to stay one step ahead of crimin attack who seek to pri into person inform ,  Mr. Federighi said .

A senior execut said in a confer call with report Tuesday that if the govern found the method did not work and tri to forc Appl to help break into the phone , Appl would have question about what wa tri , in order to keep it product as secur as possibl .If the third-parti method doe work , the govern may dismiss a court order demand that Appl weaken it secur , but keep the process it use to break into the phone under seal . In that case , Appl would have no way of know how the govern broke into it softwar or hardwar .Exploit in Apple code have becom increasingli covet over time , especi as it mobil devic have becom ubiquit , with an underground ecosystem of broker and contractor will to pay top dollar for them .Flaw in Apple mobil devic can typic fetch $ 1 million .

By Novemb , Zerodium said a team of undisclos hacker had success claim the bounti .Chaouki Bekrar , the founder of Zerodium , said hi compani wa not the outsid parti refer to in the government court file on Monday . But Mr. Bekrar ad that even if Zerodium had help the F.B.I. , he would not disclos it .For everi Zerodium , there are a thousand other organ like Zerodium that are far less vocal about do what they do and will pay research who find thi stuff to keep it a secret ,  said Casey Elli , the founder of BugCrowd , a compani in San Franciso that help vendor manag bug bounti program .The heat battl between the Unit State govern and Appl over break into the iPhon use by the San Bernardino gunman may have inadvert catalyz the underground market for Appl code flaw . With the F.B.I . push Appl to help unlock the devic with a court order and public that it ha been unabl to get into the iPhon , hacker realiz there wa a blank check for them if they could accomplish it , said Jon Oberheid , the chief technolog offic of Duo Secur , a cloud secur compani .Some secur research said no bounti Appl could offer now would match the reward they could expect from the underground market . Appl ha wait so long that the black market for it flaw ha becom extrem lucr , perhap make ani bug bounti program the compani would creat seem late to the game .Appl can embrac secur research , or tri to facilit program that will secur it oper system , but it never go to be abl to compet with what is go on behind the scene in the black market ,  said Jay Kaplan , a former N.S.A . analyst and co-found of Synack , a compani that deploy hacker to weed out vulner in clients system . It just not go to happen.', 'WASHINGTON  Debt-laden Puerto Rico went toe to toe with it creditor at the Suprem Court on Tuesday , argu that it ha been wrongli lock out of the bankruptci court , the onli place it can reason expect to restructur it crush debt .Wev talk a lot about legal principl ,  said the lawyer Christoph Landau , sum up hi argument on behalf of the commonwealth . But thi is also a flesh-and-blood situat in Puerto Rico.Hang on the outcom , he said , were question like whether peopl in a villag in Puerto Rico will be abl to get clean water.Puerto Rico is struggl with $ 72 billion in debt and ha been say for more than a year that it need to restructur at least some of it under Chapter 9 , the part of the bankruptci code for insolv local govern . But Puerto Rico can not do so , becaus Chapter 9 specif exclud it , although it is unclear whi .In 2014 , the island tri to get around that exclus by enact it own version of a bankruptci law , design for it big public util , which account for about $ 26 billion of the total debt . But that attempt ran afoul of yet anoth provis of the code , which say that onli Congress can enact bankruptci law .Congress ha shut the door ,  said Mr. Landau . There is no door for Puerto Rico , and no key for Puerto Rico.Mani of the justices question , and the parties respons , involv possibl rational for tie Puerto Rico hand , as Congress went out of it way to do in 1984 . It amend that year also bar the District of Columbia , without leav ani legisl histori or indic of intent .Whi would Congress preclud Puerto Rico from Chapter 9 ?  ask Chief Justic John G. Robert Jr .Whi would Congress put Puerto Rico in thi never-nev land ?  ask Justic Ruth Bader Ginsburg . Whi in the world ? What explain Congress want to put Puerto Rico in thi anomal posit of not be abl to restructur it debt ? It the question that everyon ask when they pick up thi case ,  said Mr. Landau .He and the lawyer repres Puerto Rico creditor , Matthew D. McGill , agre that no one knew for sure , but both offer theori .Mr. McGill said the 1984 amend wa not all that mysteri if you consid that Congress had a long histori of micromanag Puerto Rico indebted . He cite a 1917 feder law that specif limit the amount of debt that Puerto Rico could take on , which remain in forc until Puerto Rico ratifi it own constitut in 1952 . Even then , he said , Congress agre to lift it own debt restrict onli becaus Puerto Rico had includ a similar restrict in it new constitut .He also said that Congress had tacitli encourag the widespread purchas of Puerto Rican debt , by permit Puerto Rico to market it bond as triple-tax-exempt in all American state and citi . As a result , Puerto Rican debt is except wide held across the Unit State mainland , and Congress may have want to protect investor by make it hard for Puerto Rico to reneg .The third reason is that by 1984 , Puerto Rico and D.C. were the two most indebt territori , by a lot ,  he said . Under those circumst , Congress wa unlik to have want to allow the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico to write their own municip bankruptci law , that may or may not treat their nationwid creditor fairly.Mr. Landau offer an entir differ theori as to whi Congress had enact the law at issu . He said the legal provis were be misread , and that Congress had not realli intend to shut Puerto Rico out of bankruptci .While lawyer , judg and polici maker have grappl with these issu , Puerto Rico financ have gone from bad to wors . The island ha alreadi default on about $ 221 million of debt , prompt lawsuit by some of the affect creditor . And bigger , far more contenti default appear immin .On May 1 the island all-import Govern Develop Bank must make debt payment of $ 422 million , which it doe not seem to have . Two month later , about $ 2 billion is due from the central govern and a number of big public enterpris : the electr power author , the water and sewer author and the highway author , among other . Puerto Rico constitut effect guarante at least some of those payment , but the money to make them appear to have dri up .Gov . Alejandro Garca Padilla ha said that he will not make debt payment if it mean depriv the Puerto Rican peopl of essenti servic . But skip the big payment due in May and Juli would probabl mean mani more creditor lawsuit .And a default by the Govern Develop Bank , which overse the island financ , could set off a far-reach chain reaction . The bank ha guarante the debt of numer other agenc and privat compani , and insur hundr of person mortgag . Those guarante and insur would presum lose valu in a default , hurt the balanc sheet of ani number of institut .Analyst have warn that it could take year to sort out the result mess , and in the meantim , Puerto Rico would be a pariah , less and less abl to protect the safeti and well-b of it more than three million resid .When it first enact it own version of bankruptci in 2014 , Puerto Rico had hope to restructur onli a few larg govern enterpris .But two big mutual fund compani , Franklin Advis and OppenheimerFund , file suit on the same day the law wa enact . They argu that no matter how much Puerto Rico might want to take shelter from creditor , the bankruptci code clearli said it could not file for Chapter 9 protect , nor could it enact it own bankruptci law . The Unit State District Court in San Juan and the Court of Appeal for the First Circuit agre .As the case inch along through the court , it becam increasingli clear that restructur the public enterpris alon would not be nearli enough to solv Puerto Rico problem .Last year , certain congression committe began work with the Treasuri Depart on legisl that would give Puerto Rico a legal framework for restructur all of it debt under the Territori Claus of the Unit State Constitut . That approach would help Puerto Rico cope without run into the special exclus that ha been keep the island out of Chapter 9 .Isnt there also legisl to put Puerto Rico back in Chapter 9 ?  Justic Ginsburg ask on Tuesday .Ye there is ,  said Mr. McGill . Congress is consid a rang of option for Puerto Rico , includ Chapter 9 , just as Congress consid a rang of option for the District of Columbia dure it own financi crisi in the 1990 , which result in a financi control board rather than Chapter 9.A Hous bill is expect to be introduc by the end of March , in keep with instruct issu by the speaker , Paul D. Ryan . A Senat bill is like to follow . They are expect to provid some framework for restructur other than Chapter 9 .

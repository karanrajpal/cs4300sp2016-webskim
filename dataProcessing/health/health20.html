      	<p>My son is Abraham Amuhaya Imbula. He was born Nov. 16, 2009. The silence at his delivery penetrates my being. I remember his pregnancy, delivery, and the time we spent with him so vividly. I can still smell his scent. Our family valued our time with him. When my 2-year-old daughter, Gabriella, met Abraham, she said he is sick and needs a doctor and ran out to get a doctor. We held him and kissed him. We took photos. I trust his life was for a purpose. His memorial service was beautiful, with so many friends and family. Gabriella, his big sister,  gave a gift of a smaller version of her elephant to Abraham that was buried with him.</p>

      	<p>There is so much shame that comes in the moment of delivering a dead or dying baby.  We feel like we should get the goodbye over too fast. Don&apos;t. We have so many hormones and feelings that want us to care for our newborn but you only get one chance - bathe, diaper, dress the baby, take pictures.  Weigh and measure and footprint the baby. Talk to the baby and explore his body. Take lots of photos because you will want to remember the baby. You will need proof that he was really there when you are alone and sad and angry and milk is pouring out of your breasts. It will all feel like a bad dream&hellip;</p>

      	<p>Welcome to the &quot;exclusive club&quot; that NOBODY wants to be a part of. Words cannot begin to describe the overall emotional, physical, and psychological intensity of the experience. It is a very painful, traumatic experience. If this happens to you, there are some things you can do to help ease the pain while honoring your loved one. Make sure that you spend time with the baby, holding the baby and take pictures. You can have professional photos taken free of charge by the organization <a href="https://www.nowilaymedowntosleep.org/">Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep.</a> This is something that will help keep your child&apos;s memory alive! Honor his or her life because your baby matters, even though he or she never breathed air.</p>

There is no timetable for this, because enduring grief is different for each individual, and each couple.

It&apos;s been nearly six years since we lost our son and it took us almost two years of grieving to be ready to have another child. Since then, we&apos;ve had two beautiful boys born to us.

      	<p>There is no right or wrong way to experience a stillbirth. When I was faced with the heinous news of a placental abruption and fetal demise due to preeclampsia in Week 30, the first words out of my mouth were &apos;pump me full of as many drugs as possible.&apos; I commend all of those who still salvaged a birth experience and could see the beauty in the actual process. That was not me and I do not regret it. The pain and the joy still found me. Even doped up delivering in the ICU, I still felt the oxytocin rush and the LOVE. I also was hallucinating about being in a mountain chalet with a roaring fire. Yes to pictures,&hellip;</p>

      	<p>We were 26 weeks into our first pregnancy with our sweet little girl, Brooklyn Skye, when our world made a change in a direction no one expected. Her movement decreased but being that it was my first pregnancy and still fairly early I was challenged with what my heart was telling me. The biggest heart break of a lifetime came when the nurse grabbed my foot when the ultrasound at the hospital showed no heart beat. Brooklyn was born still Nov. 19, 2013.  No words can explain the pain that your heart and soul experience when you lose your baby, when you lose your dreams, when you lose your entire world. Alone. What now? Why? How do you move&hellip;</p>

I was 35 weeks pregnant when we found out my daughter didn&apos;t have a heart beat. My world and my life have never been the same after her birth. I know one in four pregnancies ends in either a miscarriage or a stillbirth. There are 26,000 families that experience stillbirth every year. I want to tell these families that they are not alone.

Kind, kind, kind nurses who encouraged us to hold our daughter and spend time with her. Giving her a name: Hope.

The shock of knowing your baby was dying was one thing but we weren&apos;t prepared to find out that our options were limited. In our home state of Alabama, if a baby dies after 12 weeks, a mother has few choices. She can continue to carry her dead baby until she is full term and at 37 weeks it could be delivered by induction, or go to a state that allowed late term abortions. I am a happily married, healthy and highly-educated 31-year-old woman and these were my choices? It was more devastating&hellip;</p>

Over the next weeks we had several appointments with many specialists and her diagnosis got graver and graver. At 22 weeks, I went in for an ultrasound and there was no heartbeat. My mom was there as I cried and held me as they confirmed our little girl had died. Calling my husband to tell him was the hardest thing I have ever had to do.

Neither training as a therapist nor losing my parents years before prepared me for this very different grief that jars your soul. The advice I treasured most was a simple &quot;Hold on.&quot; It&apos;s more than you feel you can do in the earliest, harshest days after loss.

Allow yourself to grieve in your own way, and understand that you and your partner will grieve differently and on different time spans. Take time for yourself and spend time together.

      	<p>I&apos;ve started to write then stopped several times. I&apos;ve had three late-term losses after a perfect pregnancy. One at 22 weeks, one at 15 weeks, and my final at 20 weeks. You can call me a sort of an sad expert on late-term loss but I have no words of wisdom. Because I had already had one healthy textbook pregnancy, the first loss came as a complete shock. I thought that because I had my perfect pregnancy once, I&apos;d be in the clear -- that my body knew &quot;how to grow a baby.&quot; My heart is broken. My family is incomplete.

      	<p>&quot;Unspeakable sadness&quot; were the words that resonated most when my son died at 41 weeks. Unspeakable sadness for many reasons -- because stillbirth is one of the saddest and most profound forms of grief, and unspeakable because it is so very hard to discuss.</p><p>The juxtaposition of grief and babies is awful. Finding space for this pain and grief at a time which was geared toward great delight and happiness is almost impossible. I remember thinking it was like hurtling towards a fantastic jump from a great height -- only to slam into a very hard wall. So it&apos;s understandable that many around you struggle to cope with the emotion.  &hellip;</p>

Douglas was almost full term, but the umbilical cord was wrapped around his neck. There are special grieving groups.

      	<p>My son, Jacob, was stillborn in February. I read once that losing a parent is like losing your past, losing a spouse is like losing your present, and losing a child is like losing your future. My future is not how I had imagined it would be during my pregnancy, and I am still figuring out how to make the future beautiful and meaningful without my son physically here. One thing I do feel really strongly about is that since my son doesn&apos;t get the opportunity to live and see the world for himself, it is my job to living a life in honor of him, and I resolve to see the world for him.

The doctors refused to move us into labor and delivery because I was mere hours from the 20 weeks cutoff. After being my own advocate and threatening to sue the doctor, I was moved up there. The staff was wonderful and kind during delivery and my night nurse in postpartum was an angel. They took photos and imprints of his feet. I got to bathe him, dress him, and hold him for 30 hours.

I joked with the baby (did not know if it was a boy or girl) that this was not the appropriate behavior for such an occasion. Later that night, the dancing stopped. I began to feel pain and realized I was in labor. Once we arrived at the hospital, an excited nurse looked at me and confirmed my joyful suspicion by saying, &quot;Honey you are in labor!&quot; It was so exciting! Then it was horrifying and sad and scary. I woke from my c-section to the sound of my father&hellip;</p>

      	<p>Whatever you feel, whatever you need, it&apos;s all good. Don&apos;t judge yourself. I&#x2019;ve gone through such a storm of emotions since losing my son Daniel. From extreme jealousy when seeing other (pregnant) mothers to overwhelming gratitude to have had those special and life changing 6 months with him. The moment they told me my baby&#x2019;s heartbeat had stopped, my life became this absurd parallel universe, where somehow I managed to not fall apart. Going through labor and eventually giving birth to my stillborn son has been a blessing in disguise. It felt like the only thing I could still do was to give him a sacred and loving welcome into this world. The fact that he never took his first&hellip;</p>

      	<p>After I lost my daughter Dakota Marie at eight months I felt guilty and ashamed. I felt that I didn&apos;t do enough. That day in the hospital room was the worst day of my life. The silence and pain we all felt was unbearable. After hours of labor she arrived. Not hearing her cry killed me. In the days that followed I was so numb to everything. My husband would try to stay strong for me but I would catch him breaking down at times. The funeral was a blur, it was so hard to go through the process of burying a child. No parent should have to go through that. Shortly after this I found out I was pregnant&hellip;</p>

      	<p>Don&apos;t forget to breathe. Don&apos;t forget to cherish every moment with your baby. Even in the darkness, find light. I was so scared to deliver my daughter, I had no idea what a 28-week-old baby would look like. I was horrified at the thought of someone taking pictures of her, but then I saw her and held her and I was so in love. I cherished the four hours I spent rocking her before the funeral home took her away and I am thankful for the pictures we have with her. I would also give advice to not keep quiet, be vocal about your grief and feelings. As a military spouse we were alone in a lot of our journey&hellip;</p>

      	<p>Giving birth to death forces you to come to psychological terms with the fullness of life and hold, in one singular moment, the diversity and complexity of the human experience.

      	<p>I was 37 weeks into my pregnancy when one night I realized I hadn&#x2019;t felt my baby move all day. After calling my midwife, I tried not to worry when she suggested I go to the hospital. There the nurses performed three ultrasounds before a doctor finally came in and told me they couldn&#x2019;t find a heartbeat, my baby had died. My labor was induced and 8 hours later I delivered my baby into a room of silence. My husband watched as the midwife unraveled the umbilical cord which had wrapped tightly around his neck. They handed him to us and we held him and kissed him and told him how much we loved him. We named him, Lucas Russell&hellip;</p>

      	<p>I became very ill during my pregnancy and lost my little girl. While it was never confirmed, the doctors told me that I it was likely due to listeria. I was in intensive care following the delivery of the baby, and I vividly remember my in-laws asking me what I had eaten and why I had been working so hard while pregnant. I had trouble speaking because of the breathing mask, and was too weak to sit up -- there was no way to escape their blame. Grief can make people cruel.</p><p>For years I believed that I had mistakenly survived. I was terrified to &quot;try again&quot; for another child and wanted no part of the crushing responsibility of motherhood.</p>

Time is the best healer.</p><p>Here is how I would summarize: If you have faced the loss of a child, please do not lose hope.

My husband rushed me to the hospital. I was reluctant to go. I thought I was just in early labor. At the hospital, I heard the dreaded news from a nurse: There was no heartbeat. I wanted my mother. Now the pain in my abdomen was excruciating. They performed an emergency C-section. My husband encouraged me to see the baby. I kissed the side of his little head. I named him Anthony, after my father. No one could help me with the pain of losing him.</p>

      	<p>The grief is real. You will not be able to move forward unless you allow yourself to feel this grief. Stillbirth is one of those tragedies that people cannot truly empathize with unless they have experienced something similar themselves. When my first child was stillborn in 1998, I did not have a &quot;real life&quot; support group to help me deal with my pain. Although well-meaning, my friends and family&apos;s misguided silence about what I had just experienced drove me into a deeper depression. I found an online support group (Share Atlanta) that published a monthly newsletter with stories, letters and poems written by other bereaved parents. There was also a pen pal section for parents to connect with one another.</p>

            <p>My son is Abraham Amuhaya Imbula. He was born Nov. 16, 2009. The silence at his delivery penetrates my being. I remember his pregnancy, delivery, and the time we spent with him so vividly. I can still smell his scent. Our family valued our time with him. When my 2-year-old daughter, Gabriella, met Abraham, she said he is sick and needs a doctor and ran out to get a doctor. We held him and kissed him. We took photos. I trust his life was for a purpose. His memorial service was beautiful, with so many friends and family. Gabriella, his big sister,  gave a gift of a smaller version of her elephant to Abraham that was buried with him. Sometimes Gabriella will slip the elephant, which she named Abraham, into my bed to surprise me. For five days everything was about him. I feared he would be forgotten.  He is not. Honoring him is part of our life as a family. We love him. Abraham&#39;s younger brother, Ganira, will say, &quot;Our family is Mom, Dad, God, Gabriella, Abraham, me and Musomi.&quot;  Musomi is Abraham&#39;s 10-month-old sister. We do a memorial walk yearly. We celebrate his birthday with an individualized elephant cake. Abraham&#39;s name is on our yearly family Christmas ornament.  We hold him in our heart.</p>

<p>I want to be asked about Abraham. I may cry and it is okay. I might not cry. It brings joy to my heart to remember him. I imagine him being 5 years old and wonder what he would be like.</p>

          <div class="text">
            <p>Ever since losing my daughter when I was just 24 weeks pregnant, I&#39;ve dreamed of becoming a superhero. When I read or hear about another family that&#39;s experienced a stillbirth, I want to don a disguise and fly to the mother’s side. I want to guard her front door, answer her phone, manage her Facebook account, intercept her text messages, anything that can shield her from the well-meaning, yet often thoughtless behavior of people.</p>

<p>I want to tell her this sucks. That no matter how many people tell you that “nature takes its course” or that “God has a purpose” or that “everything happens for a reason,” that what happened isn’t part of any higher plan or purpose. It just happened, and it’s awful. And that there are other women out there who know what it’s like, who can offer the support - physical and emotional - that you need, who can show you that you can and will survive.</p>

<p>Essentially, I want to offer her the protection that I didn’t have.</p>

<p>I don’t think you can prepare for a stillbirth - to prepare would be to give up hope, to imagine the worst. But now, looking back, I do wish that we as a society talked about it more. I think my desire to help is because birth has become so medical, has left the hands of midwives and women who would pass this knowledge on to other midwives and women. Stillbirths are not rare, but we don’t talk about them. And this needs to change. We need to share our stories, our heartbreak and our survival. It&#39;s the only way to move forward, remember our lost children, and honor our experience.</p>

            <p>There is so much shame that comes in the moment of delivering a dead or dying baby.  We feel like we should get the goodbye over too fast. Don&#39;t. We have so many hormones and feelings that want us to care for our newborn but you only get one chance - bathe, diaper, dress the baby, take pictures.  Weigh and measure and footprint the baby. Talk to the baby and explore his body. Take lots of photos because you will want to remember the baby. You will need proof that he was really there when you are alone and sad and angry and milk is pouring out of your breasts. It will all feel like a bad dream and you will need proof.  Know that you are forever changed by your loss and you will be hit by it over and over on his birthdays, when you have another baby, when he would have started kindergarten. Develop rituals when you are sad. Talk about the baby. Tell your future kids about it. Tell strangers about it. Get a tattoo in a prominent place to get others to ask you about it. Embrace the new, changed you and let go of any expectation of getting over it.</p>

Honor his or her life because your baby matters, even though he or she never breathed air. Have a memorial service, and prepare a grave or cremation to have something tangible to visit or hold on to. If this is possible at your hospital, have them take either finger/foot prints, and/or mold cast of the hands/feet. Obtain a formal certificate from the government as in New York - they actually have a &quot;certificate of stillbirth.&quot; Join a support group at least online, but ideally join one in person or BOTH.  The best people to hear from are those that have gone through it, and we all will share that it does get softer... eventually. Finally, come to grips with the fact that no matter what happens, nothing will make this horrible tragedy better. It will forever change you going forward in the future. You will have times when it hits you, and hits you hard. You will despise others with children. You will feel inadequate and guilty. You will need to go through the grieving process. Seek professional help if needed.</p>

              <q>American society tells us we must be strong and that showing emotion is a sign of weakness. But that is wrong.</q>
            
          </div>
          <div class="text">
            <p>Take as much time as you need to embrace the grief and begin healing your body and soul. There is no timetable for this, because enduring grief is different for each individual, and each couple. But there is no point trying to deny your pain or run from it because the grief will follow you and come like a thief in the night. It&#39;s been nearly six years since we lost our son and it took us almost two years of grieving to be ready to have another child. Since then, we&#39;ve had two beautiful boys born to us. But sometimes unexpectedly, the trauma of watching my wife deliver our stillborn son still comes over me like a wave. But if this happens to you, let the tears flow because they have a redemptive, healing effect. I say this especially to fathers who have lost a child. American society tells us we must be strong and that showing emotion is a sign of weakness. But that is wrong. You must let yourself grieve or it will haunt you forever. </p>

<p>Also, do whatever you feel is necessary to honor the life and sustain the memory of your child. When I look back to those dark days, one consolation is that we did everything possible to treat our son, and each other, with love, dignity and respect.  We took photos with our son and I will treasure those forever. We had a memorial service for him, and we still do every year. And our choice was not to bury our son. We made the urn for his remains. Today Nathaniel watches over his younger brothers in their play room. Our children are not lost - they live on forever in all of us.</p>

              <q>It will take you a long time to not feel evil and sketchy around other pregnant women. Don’t force that, it will come easier when it truly matters.</q>

          <div class="text">
            <p>There is no right or wrong way to experience a stillbirth. When I was faced with the heinous news of a placental abruption and fetal demise due to preeclampsia in Week 30, the first words out of my mouth were &#39;pump me full of as many drugs as possible.&#39; I commend all of those who still salvaged a birth experience and could see the beauty in the actual process. That was not me and I do not regret it. The pain and the joy still found me. Even doped up delivering in the ICU, I still felt the oxytocin rush and the LOVE. I also was hallucinating about being in a mountain chalet with a roaring fire. Yes to pictures, even if you can&#39;t look at them in the now. When your milk comes in the physical pain matches your heartbreak.  Grieve alone and with others at YOUR discretion. You may find that your spouse may not be the best person to share the what-ifs, the ugly thoughts. I wrote out the most vile wretched selfish angry things and that truly did help. People will share their stories and you will appreciate it.  You will also become an anecdote to your friends and family. It will take you a long time to not feel evil and sketchy around other pregnant women. Don&#39;t force that, it will come easier when it truly matters. Eat, cry, try again or not, or later.  Feel, sublimate, adopt a pet, act like a lunatic when the checker at Rite Aid wants to look at your self-developed pictures to price them out accurately.  She doesn&#39;t DESERVE to lay eyes on your precious son! Don&#39;t worry, you won&#39;t forget. Time blurs and softens but does not erase. </p>

            <p>We were 26 weeks into our first pregnancy with our sweet little girl, Brooklyn Skye, when our world made a change in a direction no one expected. Her movement decreased but being that it was my first pregnancy and still fairly early I was challenged with what my heart was telling me. The biggest heart break of a lifetime came when the nurse grabbed my foot when the ultrasound at the hospital showed no heart beat. Brooklyn was born still Nov. 19, 2013.  No words can explain the pain that your heart and soul experience when you lose your baby, when you lose your dreams, when you lose your entire world. Alone. What now? Why? How do you move on? The thought of moving on made me sick and angry. As each day went on so did the pain. Would it ever stop?...no. One of the best decisions I made during this experience was to see a therapist shortly after losing Brooklyn. Talking about my loss has given me strength and allowed me to honor our sweet angel. I started talking in our private sessions and moved onto support groups and remembrance ceremonies. I am not alone. I like to say I learned to ride the waves, some moments are easier then others. It&#39;s important to find peace within your heart, do what makes you happy. I brought back my inner painter. We will continue to honor our baby girl celebrating her birthdays, signing her name as a member of our family and talking about her every time someone asks a question about having any kids. Brooklyn has given us a beautiful rainbow, a brother named Connor. No day goes by that we don&#39;t think of our girl, our love is endless for both babies. </p>

            <p>My husband and I lost our daughter. After the first trimester you think you are in the clear. You won&#39;t lose your baby. I now know that is not true. I was 35 weeks pregnant when we found out my daughter didn&#39;t have a heart beat. My world and my life have never been the same after her birth. I know one in four pregnancies ends in either a miscarriage or a stillbirth. There are 26,000 families that experience stillbirth every year. I want to tell these families that they are not alone. The worst thing you could possible do is to isolate yourself. I did that. I wanted to shut the world out and hide under the blankets and cry. And I did that. I cried and cried and couldn&#39;t get out of bed. My husband and I were different. We were sad and angry. Angry at each other. As a couple facing the loss of their child it&#39;s hard not to be angry at each other. You want to blame someone for your loss, so you blame each other. Please don&#39;t blame each other. Communication is the most important thing. It wasn&#39;t until after a huge fight my husband and I finally broke the silence. We let all of our frustrations out and we were finally able to heal with each other. Grieve with each other and not alone. </p>

<p>Be gentle to yourself. Let yourself grieve and cry. It&#39;s O.K. to yell, scream and cry. You lost your child, no one knows how you feel. Don&#39;t let anyone say it&#39;s time to move on or it was God&#39;s will. Your &quot;new normal&quot; will be hard to navigate. But when someone asks you how many children you have, always include your angel. Honor and love your angel. </p>

            <p>I, too, remember the panicked look on the ultrasound technician&#39;s face and then the radiologist turning to face us with the news. Crying at home. Sharing news with family and friends (the first call was to our pastor who was remarkable - so helpful and understanding). Preparing for birth and delivery. Kind, kind, kind nurses who encouraged us to hold our daughter and spend time with her. Giving her a name: Hope. Then deciding to have her body cremated, hold a small memorial service to share our pain and with friends and family -- rather than hide it away or ignore it. My parents couldn&#39;t be there for the service but a couple of weeks later we took a long weekend with them by Lake Superior where we took a very special moment to spread Hope&#39;s ashes at the mouth of a small creek, watching them flow into the big water with our prayers. VERY comforting. Yes, it was weird. But I remember the relief everyone felt at being able to share that weird experience together. And whenever we share our story I get choked up - even now writing this - and it was 22 years ago! But there are no regrets or guilt and we feel like we honored our baby. We received a small stained glass angel with &quot;Hope 4-1-94&quot; on it which we hung in a sunny window. We received a book in the hospital: &quot;Empty Arms.&quot; It talks about what happened and gets you to consider how to respond, cautioning about the tradition of silence and ignoring while providing ideas about how to honor your baby and involve family, friends and faith along with you.</p>

            <p>We learned that our son Simon&#39;s heart stopped beating on Feb. 16, 2014 -- he was born Feb. 17, 2014 just one week shy of his due date. 6 pounds, 12 ounces, 20 1/4 inches, with beautiful wavy brown hair.</p>

<p>To others that will go on to experience this type of loss, you have my unending condolences. </p>

<p>It was so shocking to have our seemingly healthy pregnancy end in stillbirth at 39 weeks, we were not thinking clearly and I regret not doing many things during the short time we had with our son. Please know that you can spend as much time as you want with your baby. You can bathe your baby, put him in the clothes you bought, bring family in to meet him and take as many photographs as possible. Get foot and hand prints and a lock of hair. These things may seem wrong at the time, but trust me when I tell you every memory will be a treasure.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let hospital staff rush you into deciding what to do with your baby&#39;s body. This is an important decision and should not be taken lightly. Don&#39;t be afraid to ask friends and family to help you make arrangements.  </p>

<p>Know that the grief, anguish and pain you feel is normal. Know that your life will be forever changed by your child&#39;s presence. Know that it is O.K. to name your baby and talk about him and display his pictures. Don&#39;t let anyone stifle your desire to speak about your child and show just how much you miss him. Be assured you will never forget your baby.</p>

              <q>Making our grief public allowed us to recognize Grace and her place in our life.</q>
            
          </div>
          <div class="text">
            <p>My advice to others would be to honor your loss. Take time with your baby in the hospital. Hold your child if you feel able. Keep the blanket or clothes on which your baby was lain. Have a service if you feel able -- for us, making our grief public allowed us to recognize Grace and her place in our life. It also gave those around us the ability to support, embrace, even carry us through months of grieving and heartache. It was there, out in the open, real and tangible for all of us and so, then, could be their efforts to walk with us through our grief. In doing that, we found great healing.  </p>

<p>I would advise couples to seek support from others going thru this type of loss. All around you there are babies and families and happy people and you feel so alone. YOU ARE NOT ALONE. Seek out anyone you can who will listen and honor your grief. Be honest with your self and others and know that it is O.K. to say that you are NOT O.K. And know, also, that you will survive. You will wake up and breathe and take steps and move through your day. You will see your baby&#39;s nursery and sob and drive by a kids toy store and break down and that&#39;s O.K. Those tears and feelings honor the beautiful child you carried inside of you. They honor you and your role as that child&#39;s parent. And over time you will find that your breaths are deeper and those moments are easier to take.  You will survive this and you will never be the same.</p>

            <p>My daughter, Ellanora Grace was stillborn Nov. 21, 2013. I had noticed reduced movement but since I was in the third trimester, I didn&#39;t worry too much. Nine days after a perfectly normal check up we confirmed my worst fear. Her heart had stopped. I was induced the next day and had a dedicated perinatal nurse, who has since become my friend. Ella&#39;s delivery took place in the hospital where I am employed; my colleagues  and manger treated me differently after this delivery (which was complicated by placenta accreta). I think people are too afraid to try to &quot;go there&quot; and understand how to best support you during this loss, and out of fear, they often lock up and say nothing at all; the silence stifles. The silence felt as though people around me pretended my daughter never existed. A mother&#39;s worst fear compounded exponentially. My daughter matters. Her story matters. She is loved. I am working to help educate my employer on how to better handle bereaved parents when they return. A simple, genuine &quot;I am so sorry&quot; can go far. Asking the parent what they need instead of assuming they don&#39;t want to talk about their baby is imperative. Don&#39;t be afraid to talk about the baby...the baby is always on the bereaved parent&#39;s mind, saying his/her name is like a gift.</p>

            <p>My son Adam was born still at 40 weeks or full term.  He was 8 lbs. and 21 inches long, just beautiful. Adam had dark brown hair and my husband&#39;s facial features, but no one ever said congratulations to us. Adam was baptized by our priest in a hospital room, not a church. Adam did not receive a death certificate either, but lived for 9 months. My body did not know my child had died. The breastmilk came in, and my arms ached with emptiness. My house was full too, full of baby items. Each new day, brought on a different challenge.  Removing the car seat, setting aside the bath toys, packing baby clothes with the tags still on. Slowly I was developing into a different person, a better person. I found courage I didn&#39;t know existed. It was hard, but I would do it all again just to hold my son for another moment. That&#39;s all we have in life after all.  </p>

            <p>Our first son, Luke, was stillborn on September 10, 2012, at 39 weeks. After a completely uneventful pregnancy, I noticed a lack of movement on a Sunday, went to the hospital, and we were told the inexplicable: He was gone. There was no turning back. A cord accident took him from us when he should have just been born.</p>

<p>What I can say to others now, nearly three years out from our loss and holding our rainbow baby in our arms, is that grief never ends, but life will be different. You won&#39;t always feel incapacitated by your sadness and you&#39;ll be able to feel happiness again. But you will never be the same person you were before. You&#39;ll find empathy that you had no idea you possessed. Find in yourself the ability to share your story and your grief with anyone who will listen -- I can promise you that this will help in your healing. Connect with others who understand and know your feelings. Their reassurance and capacity to understand exactly what you&#39;re feeling will be invaluable.</p>

<p>I used to feel invincible, but after losing Luke, I understand that no amount of want or hope or praying can guarantee you happiness. The universe will continue to cause heartache and pain, but it will also allow for love and happiness. It&#39;s now my choice to find happiness--To strive for it, but understand that I don&#39;t have control. None of us do. And so we must learn to live with that and find the beauty that is left for us knowing this. </p>

<p>I will work the rest of my life to make sure Luke is remembered. I say his name, I raise money for Forever Footprints and I will carry him in my heart for the rest of my life. He meant everything.</p>

            <p>I lost identical twin girls at 30 weeks. They were stillborn due to acute Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome. I was alone when I found out my daughters had passed. My husband was in California attending his brother&#39;s wedding. He returned as soon as possible. I stayed in the hospital for two additional days and had the staff bring my daughters as often as I wanted so family could see them. I regret not bathing them. I talked to anyone who would listen about my daughters. I finished their pregnancy journal with every detail of the experience and I attended a SHARE support group. I attended a SHARE Walk for Remembrance &amp; Hope. It&#39;s a wonderful experience and allows us to remember our babies in a public way. Eight years ago, I took over organizing the walk in New Jersey. It&#39;s been very helpful in dealing with my own grief but also allows me the opportunity to help others as well. I recommend anyone who&#39;s experienced a loss to attend an event to remember your baby. To hear your baby&#39;s name read aloud is just wonderful.</p>

            <p>My first child was stillborn at 40 weeks gestation after a perfectly healthy pregnancy. Nora died of a fluke E. Coli infection. We went to bed feeling her move that evening knowing we were in labor and were then told at 3 a.m. that morning when we went to the hospital to deliver, what we thought was our healthy baby girl, that there was, &quot;No heartbeat.&quot; </p>

<p>A part of me died in that hospital room that day.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been two and a half years now since she was born still. Not a day goes by where I don&#39;t think about who she would have been. Especially when I watch her little sister Zoe, now 15 months old laugh, play and becoming her own person. It breaks my heart knowing Nora will never get to grow old like Zoe and that I will never get to experience watching her grow up either.</p>

<p>When you are pregnant and filled with joy of expecting to give birth to a baby, the farthest thing on your mind is the possibility that you might birth death instead. When it does happen, there is a shift that takes place in you. A part of you dies and you are never the same again, forever changed.</p>

<p>What I want others to know is that even though your baby has died and a part of you has died, too, that doesn&#39;t mean that your motherhood isn&#39;t still alive. No matter what you are still a mother. </p>

<p>You will always be your child&#39;s mother. Always.</p>

            <p>I would tell them it is O.K. to fall apart. You’re going to cycle through guilt, confusion, anger and jealousy. You’re going to try to replay your entire pregnancy and wonder where things went wrong. And, when you try to close your eyes and pretend this is all a really bad dream, the engorged breasts, the stretch marks, the constant need to change your hospital-grade diaper will make it impossible to forget. I would encourage them to write things down -- the way your baby looked, the way it felt to hold him/her in your arms with those tiny little fingers, the way your baby smelled. It’s O.K. to try and hold on.</p>

<p>I would tell them that having postpartum hormonal changes will make everything worse. Things never get easier. Losing your baby does not get easier. But, there will come a time when some days or hours or minutes are more bearable than others.</p>

<p>I would warn them about triggers. You don’t know what they are until they happen but you will learn to cope and avoid what you need to. Now is the time to lean on your partner, your family and friends but do so cautiously: Be selfish. Some people don&#39;t know how to respond to this type of loss and will say the stupidest of things.</p>

<p>You will try to find answers but in most cases there are none. The nightmare doesn&#39;t end because the hospital bills will come months after your loss to remind you. Or, a comment will catch you off-guard. But, I would also tell them that though right now you cannot imagine ever trying again, you will one day. I would tell them I know you won&#39;t give up because mommies are the strongest people I know. </p>

            <p>Our son was born still in the eighth month of my first pregnancy on my 22nd birthday, due to a cord accident, in 1993. Fast forward until now: Married to my husband since 1991, four living children, the youngest being 11 (two miscarriages)  I find out I&#39;m unexpectedly (on birth control) pregnant at 42. Our excitement turned to sadness, as we were told our sweet girl had life limiting conditions: T-18 with multiple birth defects. Due to a T-18 diagnosis, Lainey is ineligible for life saving procedures per the doctors&#39;s standards. She passed an hour before delivery at 37 weeks.  With Ricky we prepared for his life, future, birthdays and unexpectedly we had to bury him. With Lainey we prepared for her burial, we collected family photos, made a keepsake book, bought her a beautiful dress and we said goodbye. If you are able find a skilled photographer to take pictures. Even if you can&#39;t see them now or ever you need to have the option. Just know people will say really stupid things, they love you and care, they just don&#39;t understand. Don&#39;t succumb to societal expectations; if you don&#39;t feel up to attending your sister&#39;s baby shower, don&#39;t. You carried and buried a baby. You have the right to mourn. You must consider your own self care it is vital to your survival. You&#39;ll wonder how you&#39;ll make it the first day, week, month, year. Somehow you do it, and you are better for it. You will have weepy moments (at times for the rest of your life) and that&#39;s O.K.</p>

            <p>For me the most healing activity was learning to embrace the story of how my sweet Caden was stillborn and finding the way share the love we felt for him in everyday situations. At first it took more courage than I thought I had to hold it together whenever someone asked if I had children or about my life because I might break down. While I always have to catch my breath to awkwardly shift conversation, I am committed to telling everyone the story and having everyone remember Caden’s short life with us. </p>

<p>What I have realized when sharing the story about my son is that for at least a moment most people reflect on the love of their family and remember what is truly important in life. To me, that is something special to offer. Now months later, I find myself wanting to tell his sad and touching story to everyone. </p>

<p>What I really need people to understand is that although there was never a breath taken by him, he did live, and his soul was felt deeply. For a few hours my husband and I met our son, and he was beautiful. That is why it is extremely hurtful when people minimize his life or worse of all disappear because they don’t know how to respond. </p>

<p>The best thing anyone can do to help is to say my son’s name as often as possible and don’t be afraid to bring it up. I’ve had friends and family participate in walking and running events in his honor, send mother’s day cards and visit his grave site. These type of gestures were so full of love that they helped me move forward. I need people to recognize Caden’s life and just how much he contributed to our lives.</p>

          <div class="text">
            <p>I was 19, I didn&#39;t even know this was something that happened to people. I was alone when I found out. I waited 9 hours for my contractions to start. I had to be induced, longest 9 hours of my life. He was still moving but it wasn&#39;t him, it was the contractions. Being conscious and knowing you have to go through the labor process, especially for a first-time parent, is a terribly scary thing to go through. And then the silence, the silence that haunts you forever.  </p>

<p>I chose not to see my baby, I wanted to remember him moving inside of me with hiccups and bouncing around. I don&#39;t think I could have handled closing my eyes for the rest of my life and having the image of my dead baby, it was too traumatic for me. This decision is different for everyone. I couldn&#39;t handle that. It is an experience that blindsides you completely, no one speaks about it. I really think there should be support groups on-call of women that have been through this before. I don&#39;t have any pictures, just my memories, the scars of stretch marks on my stomach and the lasting effect this has had in my heart and life.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t had a baby since, my life has taken a different path. I know I shouldn&#39;t live in fear of that but when you go through it, trust me, it stops you in your tracks.  I have had many dreams of him, he sends me butterflies. I am the mother of an angel and say it proudly as I know he watches over me every day.</p>

            <p>First of all, I am sorry. This is a terrible thing that no one should have to endure. After my daughter died from her knotted cord wrapped around her neck three times, I heard so many stories of other friends of friends where something similar had happened. I know my friends were trying to offer support, but hearing of so many other people who had suffered as I did was not a comfort. It was a further sorrow. </p>

<p>For me, my Catholic faith is what gets me through. I am fortunate many of my friends are pro-life. They knew my 37-week gestation daughter, Perpetua Grace, was a person, and continue to treat her as such. We were able to have a full funeral and burial, and knowing the Church has an ancient rite for this is comforting. I know that she will live eternally and God willing I will see her again. </p>

<p>The days are HARD. Every day is hard, and no one else truly understands. People don&#39;t always mention her because they don&#39;t want to make me sad, but trust me, I&#39;m already sad. One thing I was not prepared for was the profound sadness that envelops me. It&#39;s difficult to be around babies of friends and family, especially those her age. I&#39;ve learned to surround myself with people who are making me feel better, and for those that don&#39;t, I don&#39;t need them in my life right now. The days will get better. You will get to a point where you don&#39;t cry every day. At some point, I will make it two days in a row without crying. I know that God loves me and that is how I get through. You will get through this. Maybe not past it, but through it. </p>

          </div>
          <div class="text">
            <p>I lost my baby so many years ago, but the pain is still there. We never let the rest of our children forget that they have a brother that did not survive. The worst part of it is the guilt you feel. I don&#39;t know why I feel guilt, it is just there. On that day, I had labor pains, a very upset stomach, and not feeling at all like someone expecting a new baby to the family. My doctor, who lived next door, took me to the hospital (my husband was out of town at the time) and all I felt was chilly, and very cold. It was like I had the flu, only with labor pains.</p>

<p>After arriving at the hospital, they put me out and the next thing I remember, I was not pregnant anymore.</p>

<p>Where was my baby? I am on the maternity floor, I hear and see the babies being brought to their mothers, but where is mine, what did I have?</p>

<p>Then they told me, he did not make it, -- stillborn.  The feelings well up in me, GET ME OFF THIS FLOOR! I cannot stand hearing babies cry, happy people&#39;s remarks, none of it.  I just wanted to crawl in a hole from embarrassment, shame, whatever.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s face it, you have lost a member of your family. He or she will always be remembered. It is a way of coping with your feelings and not letting negative thoughts get in the way.</p>

<p>Needless the say, we buried our baby, he was full term. And we honor him every year. My biggest sadness is, that I never got to hold him.</p>

<p>Take care, and God Bless.</p>

            <p>During our 20-week ultrasound, my husband I were told that our baby boy had many congenital abnormalities that would be fatal. It was our first child together. The shock of knowing your baby was dying was one thing but we weren&#39;t prepared to find out that our options were limited. In our home state of Alabama, if a baby dies after 12 weeks, a mother has few choices. She can continue to carry her dead baby until she is full term and at 37 weeks it could be delivered by induction, or go to a state that allowed late term abortions. I am a happily married, healthy and highly-educated 31-year-old woman and these were my choices? It was more devastating hearing my &quot;options&quot; than knowing my child was dying. After much consideration, I pleaded with my doctor to find a way and hospital to deliver my baby. She was able to refer us to Emory Midtown Hospital in Atlanta, Ga., where it was legal to induce before 24 weeks in the case of early fetal death. The staff and doctors were amazing and extremely compassionate to my husband, me and our baby. After being induced and 22 hours of labor, we delivered Rosario. Every doctor and nurse knew our situation, allowed us all the time we needed with our baby, and treated him with such love. We are forever grateful for the opportunity to deliver and see our son. My heart breaks for the mothers living in Alabama that are forced to silently suffer as they carry their deceased child for months. Mothers deserve better.</p>

              <q>Try not to get too angry with what others might say or not say as they find out about your loss.</q>

          <div class="text">
            <p>I can still remember, over twenty years have passed, the heartbreak and feelings of helplessness and questioning.  You should take time to process/express all of the emotions and feelings and anger that arise, be communicative with those close to you, and know that, as trite as it sounds, &quot;Time heals all wounds&quot; but take it in the spirit of someone who has gone through it -- heals does not mean forget or totally assuage all that you will feel. Certainly the scars of this traumatic event will not disappear, but will fade a bit.  </p>

<p>Also, try not to get too angry with what others might say or not say as they find out about your loss. Many things are said by those who say things that perhaps are meaningful to them, but not to you. Others really do not know what to say.  </p>

<p>Although it has been over twenty years, I can still vividly remember the words of the nurse (&quot;...it doesn&#39;t look good...&quot;) and the seemingly out-of-place calmness of the medical personnel. While the pain of the loss has not left, the remembrance of that tragic event has taken on a different hue in my memory.</p>

            <p>Spend as much time with your baby as you possibly can. I can attest that later on, you will wish you could hold your baby one more time; hold them now while you can as much as you can. Take photographs. Take MANY photographs. Count your baby&#39;s fingers and toes. Look at his or her whole body. Smell your baby. Take them in. Soak them up.</p>

<p>After you leave the hospital, find a support network. Chances are high that no one in your immediate support circle has experienced this heartbreak, but there is a huge community of us out here that get it. Find us. We will understand your devastation like no one else can because we are devastated too. Search online. We are here. You are not alone.</p>

<p>Be gentle with yourself. Life it totally different now. It has changed forever. It&#39;s okay not want to go to events, parties, holiday dinners. This is hard enough. Let yourself not be okay all the time.</p>

<p>Honor your sweet, sweet baby. Plant a tree. Have a memorial stone made. Get some personalized jewelry. Release a balloon. Light a candle. Write to them. Say your child&#39;s name.</p>

<p>It gets better. I promise. The gut-wrenching pain lessens over time. I won&#39;t say the grief goes away because I think it might hurt forever, but eventually it will hurt less often. Your good days will outnumber your bad days. Your heart ache will be less intense.</p>

<p>And lastly, I&#39;m so, so sorry friend. I&#39;m sorry that your baby died.</p>

            <p>Don&#39;t hold back your emotions just to make others feel comfortable. It&#39;s an uncomfortable situation and the people who are the most uncomfortable are mom and dad. Don&#39;t worry what others think a month later. Cry all you want, scream at your higher power, be sad for as long as you need to be. People will say and do things that are unimaginable. Do your best to try to explain to them what you are feeling. They don&#39;t understand and you never want them to understand. If your father died they would ask you how you are doing. But your child died and they never want to imagine their own children dying, so they avoid, say stupid things, ignore or walk away. Let them go, because around the corner is someone who is going to say your child&#39;s name and remember their birthdays and let you know when they see rainbows and butterflies and remind them of your child. The first year is hard. It gets easier, but you will always have a hole in your heart. Go to group sessions if you can find one. They help.  Find other moms on Facebook and make friends, they help even more. Support a non-profit that is helping moms like you, it&#39;s awesome to be surrounded by others who have walked your path. Life goes on, but you will never be the same. And that is O.K. You have a different view on the world and it will be full of compassion and love.</p>

            <p>On June 1, 2010, my daughter Harper was born 7 weeks prematurely after we discovered that her identical twin sister, Mackenzie, no longer had a heartbeat. The doctors cannot explain why Mackenzie was taken from us too soon, and our questions remain unanswered. But there are a few things that my husband and I have learned from this experience that I might share with others faced with this loss. Specifically, we believe that we are better people because of Mackenzie. Mackenzie has taught us to appreciate both the ordinary and precious things in our lives. As a result, we are better parents to Harper, treating her as our daughter and not just the surviving twin of Mackenzie. We are also more appreciative of the family and friends who supported us throughout the difficult time. Mackenzie has revealed to me the things that are important in life. The fears I had prior to becoming a mother now seem incredibly insignificant. Mackenzie has inspired us to be more giving. With the help of our supporters, we now annually donate preemie clothes to local NICUs in memory of Mackenzie. Finally, Mackenzie has encouraged us not to fear death. Only in death will the four of us be together again. </p>

            <p>March 21,2014. The day they told me my baby had no heartbeat. March 22, the day I held my sweet heaven-born baby so still and so silent. March 26. The day I buried my daughter along with all of the hopes and dreams that I had of our life together as a family. Your life...our lives have been forever changed and though the dates are different, our brokenness remains the same. We have a common denominator...our babies died. Forever our hearts will be linked to dates on the calendar. People are full of advice that they have no authority to give. So allow me to be real and honest with you. Losing a child is like nothing else. It is life changing. Allow yourself to feel every ounce of grief, pain, and sorrow. Allow yourself to be weak, to be cared for. Despite people telling you to be strong...don&#39;t. Right now allow others to be strong for you. Find a support group that is specially designed for grieving parents. Through all of this horror. Through all of this pain...you must know that this was not your fault and you are not alone. Your child is loved, cherished and keeping their memory alive is beautiful. Allow yourself time. Give yourself grace. Through this pain you will slowly begin to see hope. You will slowly begin to find life after loss. Though your heart will hurt forever, there will be a day when you smile again...a smile that isn&#39;t forced or faked. Those are the moments when you suddenly realize that despite your pain, you have made it...you survived the unimaginable. This is the journey that no one wants to talk about, but we are living it. Let your voice be heard, through your voice may you help a grieving heart.</p>

            <p>When my son, Brandon, was stillborn three years ago, I thought it was my fault. How could I, his mother, not protect him when he was in my womb? Even though he was not active the night before, I shrugged it off because I had just been at the doctor that afternoon for a 31-week check up. How did I not know something was wrong? For so long I lived in a state of self-blame and hatred. I was a baby killer. I failed at the most innate of motherly tasks. Even when the doctor told me that there was a blood clot in the umbilical cord I still blamed myself. I just kept thinking I could have saved him if only ...</p>

<p>It took me a long time to accept the fact that the death of my son was not my fault. I did not think I would ever be able to laugh or smile again. I learned that one way to honor him was to not only keep going on but to to find joy in each day and to fight my way back to natural smiles and laughter. So to anyone who is going through this horrible tragedy I would say that it is important to find a way to be happy again. It&#39;s a different happy -- you will be forever changed -- but happy nonetheless.</p>

<p>I would also say that stillborn babies are still babies and should be honored and recognized. Thanks to Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep I have beautiful images of my baby that I proudly display in my home. I will always say his name and count him as one of my children even though he never took a breath.</p>

              <q>Losing a baby was part of life for as long as there was human life, it is very modern of us to forget.</q>

          <div class="text">
            <p>When I was eight weeks pregnant, I had a dream the baby told me she was dying and it was time to go, I told her it was okay and that I loved her. The next day I saw blood, but she held on.</p>

<p>She was healthy and I wasn&#39;t prepared at 28 weeks when I hemorrhaged. Blood was pouring out of me in a way that made horror movie blood look conservative. I can’t forget the smell of pennies. My little girl still kicked away.</p>

<p>I spent four weeks in the hospital before being discharged, given a clean bill of health, only to return days later when she finally went Home. As I rode up the elevator, I saw my reflection in the mirror and had to say goodbye to the baby bump that stopped growing. I laid attached to IVs for over a day as modern medicine tested when my body would no longer handle the loss of blood. I was finally taken for my emergency C-section alone. </p>

<p>When they put her in my arms it felt like the most natural thing in the world. When you spend 33 weeks growing a baby, finally holding the heavy body feels like the completion of the journey. Losing a baby was part of life for as long as there was human life, it is very modern of us to forget. </p>

<p>I&#39;m pregnant again with another girl and have a toddler son at home. People always ask how many children I have. To answer this would require me to delve into the debate on where life begins and invoke celestial beings. I don’t know. So when you feel aggravated by the sound of a baby crying, remember, some babies never did – it’s the most beautiful sound in the world.</p>

            <p>Just a few months into our marriage, my husband and I found out we were pregnant with our first child. We were beyond overjoyed. At 16 weeks we learned our little girl had Turner&#39;s Syndrome, a rare chromosomal anomaly affecting only females. Over the next weeks we had several appointments with many specialists and her diagnosis got graver and graver. At 22 weeks, I went in for an ultrasound and there was no heartbeat. My mom was there as I cried and held me as they confirmed our little girl had died. Calling my husband to tell him was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. We both knew this was a significant possibility but we thought we would have more time until it actually happened. That night I was induced and less than 24 hours later, Kaci Grace was born. We dressed her, held her and took photographs. We got footprints and spent the night with her. When we left the hospital, it felt like a piece of my soul was being left behind and that I would never be whole again. She belonged with me and I couldn&#39;t keep her. All I could think about was all the things she would never do or be a part of. Every moment that passes, I think about how she should be here, growing and learning. Forever there will be a piece of me missing and I have learn how to live without it. I carry her footprint on my arm, permanent in ink. It is the closest thing I can have to keep her with me everyday.</p>

            <p>You have suffered a real loss -- don&#39;t let anyone tell you otherwise. You&#39;ve lost all the hopes and dreams you&#39;ve had for your baby, and the chance to get to know them. That&#39;s incredibly painful because there are no memories to look back on. Just the memories of anticipation, and hope. </p>

<p>The pain will be overwhelming at times, mild at others and sometimes it may go away, and you will feel guilty. You can expect to feel worse right after it happens, or six months down the road. Eventually though it can get better. You will feel hope, and joy again but it will take time. But you will always feel a longing for that baby. In time, you&#39;ll learn to live with that, embrace it, and even be grateful for it, because that feeling makes you embrace life just a little bit more. You&#39;ll love harder, and deeper than you did before. You&#39;ll laugh harder, smile more and be more genuine, because you&#39;ll know what it takes to fake it when you don&#39;t feel that way. Your lost baby will teach you everyday how to live, and how to appreciate life. That is their gift to you. </p>

<p>Your baby will teach you that all children are a gift, and we shouldn&#39;t diminish that gift. Say your baby&#39;s name, talk about your child, and share all the hopes and dreams you had for your baby. They are, and always will be a part of your family. Your heart will heal as you include and remember them. </p>

Get an autopsy. Future families may benefit from these answers as 50% of the stillbirths each year are from an unknown cause like mine. This will be a long, unique road of grieving, but they will learn to incorporate it into their lives and grow with it. They should talk about it to anyone they wish, without concern for judgment. This could happen to anyone and they could help the next person get through it. Acknowledge that everyone is grieving with them, just in different ways so it might not seem like it. Most importantly, they are not alone.</p>

We didn&#39;t find out he was gone until we arrived at the hospital after him. I would tell families going through the same thing to spend as much time as allowed with your baby. To take as many pictures as possible. To allow your loved ones to have a moment with your child should they want it. Ask for things you would have received if your child was alive, like footprints, hand prints, weight and length. I know every state and hospital policy is different so ask what is and isn&#39;t allowed. Do for your child and yourself what you feel is right in that moment. Don&#39;t leave your child and the hospital with any regrets.</p>

              <q>We don’t ever want our living children to feel like they are keeping a secret.</q>
            
          </div>
          <div class="text">
            <p>I was 41 weeks pregnant with my third child. I&#39;d had a completely normal, healthy pregnancy until my labor started and my daughter&#39;s heart stopped. In the depths of our grief, we had to decide how my husband would tell our five year old daughter that her baby sister had died.</p>

<p>We quickly learned that we had to guide our other children through their grief as we tried to grieve ourselves. This meant answering questions, like why did this happen to us, bringing Gabriela to the hospital to meet her sister, so she could hold and kiss her, and explain this was the last time we would ever see Simone. It meant managing the coldness and anger that Gabriela felt toward me for letting her sister die. </p>

<p>My husband and I want our children to know that we hurt so much because of the love we have for Simone, that it&#39;s perfectly normal to cry, to miss the baby sister we all anxiously awaited. We don&#39;t ever want our living children to feel like they are keeping a secret, or that talking about Simone is taboo. So whenever someone asks how many children I have, I am sure to include Simone. I get awkward looks, uncomfortable responses, people trying to change the subject or leave the conversation entirely. But my daughter has taught me that it&#39;s more important to honor her sister&#39;s brief time with us and her space in our family, than it is to spare some stranger from the discomfort of our reality. </p>

<p>Now that I am expecting our fourth child, another baby girl, people remark that Gabriela will have a baby sister. She kindly informs them that she already has a baby sister, but now she will have another and I couldn&#39;t be prouder. </p>

          <div class="text">
            <p>When we lost our son Dylan we were floored, we had no idea something like this could happen in America when the mom or baby wasn&#39;t ill. Since then we have learned it is so much more common than we thought, but we are a silent group. We are silent not because we want to be but because society wants us to be. Babies are not supposed to die and so no one wants to know. It&#39;s abnormal. I never want anyone to join our group, ever, no one should feel that pain but if you do become part of that group I can tell you this: embrace your new normal. Your new normal is a life without your child where things may not make sense. It is a world where people don&#39;t know how to treat you and so they avoid you. It is a world where you learn the true meaning of love in those who stay. You learn to live with the pain. You never forget your child, you just learn to live with their memory and not their presence. Life will be a roller coaster and your heart will ache. You are not broken or weird, you are normal and everything you feel is a normal part of grief. Your wounds are not visible but you will wear them in your heart. The wounds on your heart will scar over. You will forever love your child and your broken heart will still beat.</p>

            <p>You are not alone. At at time when you may be surrounded by so many people, it is tough to not feel like you are just lost, broken and empty. Try and reach out and  find a support system. Let people help stand you up. You may find that certain people just fall out of your life, while others step up and surround with love you need. Let that fill you up. Find ways to honor your child. There are so many resources for you to do this. Talk about your child, share his or her story, you will be amazed at how many people silently grieve for their own loss and are just waiting for an opportunity to open up. There are so many of us loss parents out there, grieving as you grieve, always missing our child. My heart will always have a piece of it missing until I meet my son again, that will never go away. Don&#39;t ever be ashamed to cry, even if years have passed, those tears you are shedding are made of love, of hopes and dreams, the what-ifs and could-have-beens for your sweet babe. Don&#39;t let anyone govern how you grieve, it is your own path you are walking. It is O.K. to laugh, it is O.K. to feel happy, it is also O.K. to feel sad and to mourn what you lost. You lost a whole lifetime with your child, that isn&#39;t something to just &quot;get over.&quot; Your love for your child will never fade, it will always be there, and your grief will be there as well. I always say grief is my unwelcome companion in life, but in that grief is a love that stretches far beyond anything I could  have imagined. </p>

          <div class="text">
            <p>I had a son on June 1, 2013, Andy Maximillion.  He was 1 pound and 12 inches long, he was perfect. My advice for others is please talk about your baby, say his name often. People are often afraid or nervous to talk about a baby that should be here but isn&#39;t. Don&#39;t feel guilty, don&#39;t place blame or get angry with your other half. Remember he lost his baby, too. Cry, don&#39;t be afraid to hold in your emotions. Don&#39;t let anyone tell you when you should be done grieving. As much as they care they didn&#39;t lose a baby we did. Don&#39;t be afraid to try again. If you do try again you will never be emotionally the same, but try to enjoy your pregnancy. It&#39;s been two years and I still remember everything, the feeling when i was told he was gone. My hospital was great. Ask them for anything. Nine times out of 10 they will do whatever they can. Ask for pictures, hold your baby as long as you can, talk to him, tell him about all your dreams you had. I wrote Andy a letter that only I read and placed it in a bottle and had it buried with him. As strange as it was, it felt peaceful to know only he and I would know the details of my letter. Remember you are a mother no matter what anyone says!</p>

          <div class="text">
            <p>We faced stillbirth twice, losing one of our daughters on her due date and our son at 36 weeks, both during early labor, each to a different type of cord accident. Neither training as a therapist nor losing my parents years before prepared me for this very different grief that jars your soul. The advice I treasured most was a simple &quot;Hold on.&quot; It&#39;s more than you feel you can do in the earliest, harshest days after loss. One way to hold on is to find others who know this loss. There are sadly too many of us, and online support is a godsend in this overwhelmingly lonely loss. We want no one to have to join our groups, yet the welcome and support of these groups provide tremendous comfort and safety.  Support services in the community (such as Kindermourn in Charlotte, N.C.) are also vital though not available in all places.</p>

<p>A surprise to many after stillbirth is the constancy of living with at least two feelings at once from that point on. Holidays, the graduation of your living child, even vacations most always carry an awareness that someone is missing. Another surprise can be the struggle to cope as other children you know, particularly those around the age your child would be, reach milestones in life. The Hide button on Facebook may be your best friend as other parents post pictures of birthday parties or first days of kindergarten. Even lamentations over sibling rivalry or potty training gone awry seem to stab some days, particularly when an anniversary of loss is looming. As years pass, those moments knock the breath out of you less regularly. New normal does come, and we find ways to remember and mark the lives they didn&#39;t get to live.</p>

            <p>Our son Luke was stillborn at 40 weeks.  I had had a perfectly healthy pregnancy and was in the hospital overnight, waiting to be induced in the morning. He died while I slept. I had tremendous guilt; what kind of a mother sleeps through her baby&#39;s death? Luke had the bluest eyes of any human being I&#39;ve ever seen; but I only know that because I manually opened his eyes. I&#39;ve worked very hard to build a life for myself, my husband, and Luke&#39;s little brother, Zac; but every day I am reminded that someone is missing.  Zac doesn&#39;t know about Luke yet, but he wants a big brother.  </p>

<p>I had tremendous support from family and friends, but I definitely still worry that he will be forgotten. To some people, a stillbirth isn&#39;t as bad as a SIDS death, or the loss of an older child, because the baby never lived. He lived and lives inside me.  I have all the memories of Luke other parents have of their children, I just never got to live them. I would tell people to learn to hear what people mean, and not what they say. I am thankful for the people who tried to comfort me, because it was clear that they were scared to say the wrong thing, and some of them did. But they showed up, which is huge. Also, don&#39;t put a timeline on your grieving process. I have a happy life and feel blessed in so many ways, but I will mourn the loss of my son for the rest of my life.</p>

            <p>My daughter would have been 13 this June and turned a teenager. Although these thoughts don’t come to my mind frequently, I do often remember her and occasions that would have been. 13 years later, my heart breaks when I hear about another woman who has a stillbirth. I know the pain and sorrow in the journey she, and her family, must unfortunately face. However, with confidence I can promise opportunities for gratefulness and light through the darkness, with better days heads. </p>

<p>As I reflect back on my journey I am grateful to the doctor who cried while delivering the baby and would not go home until he knew I was O.K.; every nurse who got us through and insisted we take time to be with the baby; my family, friends and husband who did whatever they could to help me feel loved; the doctor who told me, “You have to get back on the horse;” the women I found in stillbirth chat rooms who told me better days were ahead; and the counselor who helped me in my darkest stages of grief and when I was pregnant again.</p>

<p>I now have two children 10 and 12. Thirteen years ago, I never believed this future was possible. To anyone out there in my shoes, stay strong, you are not alone. Surround yourself with people that give you support and help you feel loved. Find the resources available to you online and in your community.  Hear from woman who have been through it - let them be your source of guidance and hope, and I wish you moments of gratefulness too.</p>

            <p>When they couldn&#39;t find the heartbeat at my final 40 week check-up, the nurse&#39;s face gave it away first. She looked at me and said, &quot;Your baby is gone.&quot; My doctor said I could borrow his cell phone. My father started bawling on the phone. The doctor O.K.&#39;d a C-section, but I had to wait at the delivery area for four more hours. Thank god my mother came and held my hand because I believe that was the longest four hours of my life. When they told me it was time to hold him, I refused. I also refused all photos. The social workers, staff all came in to try and convince me otherwise. They told me it would be much harder to get over it if I did not hold him. I had already named him Teddy. Then they wanted to take the body away for autopsy, as there had been no complications. No cause was discovered, but he had been dead for awhile. They did tell me that because they shared that it was difficult getting a blood sample. The events that followed were pretty surreal. The hospital lost the body as we were preparing at the funeral home. We had him cremated and the mortician was yelling on the phone to the hospital: &quot;Where is this baby boy?&quot; They finally found him. We went to scatter the ashes at Joshua Tree National Park: a spiritual place for me. As soon as I scattered the ashes, I saw a butterfly. I knew it was Teddy. I only just revisited the park this past April. I was taking photos when I saw a butterfly again. I spoke aloud and said Teddy, I will never forget you. I think the body we have is so temporary, but our spirit carries on.</p>

            <p>I was thrilled to become pregnant with my first child in March 2012. A story I&#39;ve read from too many other women was also mine. </p>

<p>It was a textbook pregnancy - until it wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>38 weeks: I was at a routine appointment when the heartbeat of my precious son Caden couldn&#39;t be found.  I still didn&#39;t believe it until I went to the hospital and they turned on the monitor and there was nothing. I wanted to leave my body. Anything to avoid hearing the doctor say &quot;There is no heartbeat.&quot; With those four words everything stopped. The medical staff were incredible throughout the delivery and my recovery. The night before I was induced I knew I had to push my son out, I had to let him go. That was the last gift I could give him. The moment I pushed my son out of me was the saddest but most beautiful moment of my life. Holding my son I saw the most perfect little baby boy. Watching my husband hold him in his arms and in turn my sister and my best friend made it start to become real. But again brought such beauty and taught me about the deepest love. I would tell someone faced with this loss to surround yourself with positive loving people. Allow yourself to work through the grief process and know that it is individual and takes as long as it takes. I searched constantly for stories that had a happy ending. I gave birth to a sweet healthy boy in Jan. 2014. He has healed my heart. I wouldn&#39;t say I have a happy ending, but I have accepted the pain of losing my son. Caden, my angel, continues to teach me about love. Share your story, you are not alone.</p>

            <p>My daughter was born at 25 weeks because she had a fatal lung malformation. What I would say to others is this: In the tapestry of your life, this loss will be the only picture you see for a (long) time. Eventually this picture will be just one of many in the tapestry. Allow yourself to grieve in your own way, and understand that you and your partner will grieve differently and on different time spans. Take time for yourself and spend time together. Don&#39;t chide yourself or your partner about your grieving. There will be good days and bad days. It helped me to think of being on a long road that I had to follow to its end. Believe there will be an end to your pain. Get help and support.</p>

              <q>I now accept my first child’s stillbirth as no one’s fault or failure, but a mystery.</q>
            
          </div>
          <div class="text">
            <p>My son was stillborn 30 years ago at St. Vincent&#39;s Hospital in Manhattan. Even then -- and certainly now -- women with access to modern health care expect to have healthy babies when and how they wish. I was no different.</p>

<p>A couple enters that delivery room trusting that the mother&#39;s and the baby&#39;s body will each do what it&#39;s supposed to do. If the mother eats right, doesn&#39;t smoke or drink alcohol, stays in good physical condition, learns Lamaze breathing, and is coached and supported through childbirth, the prize at the end is a perfect baby. </p>

<p>I did all those things for nine months, went through 12 hours of labor in a modern hospital with no hint of any problem. My son was born with a strong heartbeat and a perfectly formed but non-functioning brain. </p>

<p>After asking dozens of questions we went home, still not understanding what went wrong. I spent the following years obsessively searching for an answer, poring over medical texts that I didn&#39;t understand, sharing my story over and over with doctors, midwives and malpractice attorneys (I never sued), not to mention family, friends, even strangers. I never got or found a satisfactory explanation.</p>

<p>After years of futile questioning and three and five years later giving birth to two healthy babies, I now accept my first child&#39;s stillbirth as no one&#39;s fault or failure, but a mystery. This conclusion goes against everything I know about modern science and believe about my own power as a woman and a mother. But accepting childbirth as a miraculous gift, to which I am in no way entitled, has allowed me to forgive myself and eventually to  heal.</p>

            <p>I had a perfectly “normal” pregnancy and at my last ultrasound, my baby’s heartbeat thumped strongly. Three days later, I went into labor and was 8 cm when I arrived to the hospital. I’ll never forget the chaos in the room as the nurses tried to find her heartbeat. Then, numerous alarms sounded that still ring in my ears today.</p>

<p>When the doctor told me she died, I had to dig so deep to deliver her. The only thing that got me through was the hope that they made a terrible mistake and that I would be holding my living baby very soon. It took 38 minutes for my whole world to crumble -- to have all my hopes and dreams for the future ripped away from me.</p>

<p>My bereavement nurse, Barbara, was incredible, and put me on a path toward recovery. She held me as I bellowed and howled, and caught me when I collapsed in mourning. She validated my feelings and comforted me with her words. Barbara nudged to me get professional photographs, made a clay footprint cast and even went back to get clippings of my daughter’s hair after I had already said my eternal goodbye. I’m so grateful for these things, because it’s all I have left of her. If Barbara didn’t encourage me, I would be living a life of regret.</p>

<p>Good care after stillbirth is critical. I don’t know where I would be if it weren’t for Barbara. I’m scared to think about it. The care you get after a stillbirth affects how you live the rest of your life. I hope all hospitals have bereavement nurses like ours did. They have the hardest most important job on the planet. </p>

            <p>I&#39;ve started to write then stopped several times. I&#39;ve had three late-term losses after a perfect pregnancy. One at 22 weeks, one at 15 weeks, and my final at 20 weeks. You can call me a sort of an sad expert on late-term loss but I have no words of wisdom. Because I had already had one healthy textbook pregnancy, the first loss came as a complete shock. I thought that because I had my perfect pregnancy once, I&#39;d be in the clear -- that my body knew &quot;how to grow a baby.&quot; My heart is broken. My family is incomplete. Doctors don&#39;t understand your pain. Friends and family don&#39;t understand your pain -- especially when you already have a living child. One of the most painful parts is the stigma attached to talking about it. In today&#39;s society, we can talk about so many topics that were once taboo.  We can talk about money, sex or drugs but my dead babies are taboo. I&#39;m O.K. I&#39;m still a great mom, I have a career, my marriage is great, and I can still small talk with moms at the school black top like the best of them. However, I&#39;m also hurting. I imagine what my baby boy would look like. I wake up in the middle of the night seeing that horrible ultrasound image. It is so lonely because I don&#39;t feel comfortable posting about my sadness on Facebook and I can&#39;t bring it up at a dinner party without looking like the crazy sad lady. Why should I act ashamed? Why should I hide away like I&#39;m damaged goods? I didn&#39;t do anything wrong. We need start the conversation. </p>

              <q>Ask friends to spread the word so you’re not left explaining to others what has happened.</q>
            
          </div>
          <div class="text">
            <p>&quot;Unspeakable sadness&quot; were the words that resonated most when my son died at 41 weeks. Unspeakable sadness for many reasons -- because stillbirth is one of the saddest and most profound forms of grief, and unspeakable because it is so very hard to discuss.</p>

<p>The juxtaposition of grief and babies is awful. Finding space for this pain and grief at a time which was geared toward great delight and happiness is almost impossible. I remember thinking it was like hurtling towards a fantastic jump from a great height -- only to slam into a very hard wall. So it&#39;s understandable that many around you struggle to cope with the emotion.  </p>

<p>I remember how friends and family struggled. I remember the challenges of the work environment. When I returned to work everyone was ready to share the joy: Again very difficult to describe how difficult that was.</p>

<p>So advice: Be kind to yourself; rest; remember and celebrate your pregnancy and your child; spend time with good friends and family; don&#39;t believe in a &quot;timetable&quot; for grief -- it&#39;s a tremendous journey that lasts a life time.</p>

<p>Practically: Ask friends to spread the word so you&#39;re not left explaining to others what has happened. Avoid children&#39;s birthday parties at least initially.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a remarkable list of people who have survived this grief including the Kennedys, film stars and many politicians. The death of your child will fundamentally alter your future, and often in a positive way. I regard this as my child&#39;s greatest legacy -- that through my profound grief I now understand happiness.</p>

            <p>We lost our son, Owen Matthew, at 36 weeks due to an unknown cause. His twin brother survived and is now a healthy toddler. We truly feel that Owen fought for as long as he could so his brother could continue to grow and be healthy. What a warrior our son was. </p>

<p>I would tell others facing this situation, that whatever feelings you are experiencing...it is O.K. It is O.K. to feel guilty that you were unable to allow your baby to take his/her first breath on Earth. It is O.K. to feel so struck with grief that you are unable to imagine getting out of bed again the next day. It is O.K. to feel angry...or confused...or helpless...or scared. It is O.K. to question your faith or your prayers that feel like went unanswered. It is O.K. to feel like you failed as a mother. It is O.K. to feel like this is unfair, or to have a &quot;Why me?&quot;moment. It is O.K. to feel lost. It is O.K. to smile when you think of your baby, even in the midst of grief. </p>

<p>I want to tell you that all of these feelings are O.K., because I have felt them too. And after experiencing of all these (and more), you will discover that, you too, will be O.K. Your guilt will subside and my hope is that you will realize that you are still a mother. You are a mother who gave her baby a life that had no discomfort or pain or tears. A life that only knew love. And maybe by questioning your faith, you will deepen yours in new ways. </p>

<p>Most importantly, there is not a day that will go by that you won&#39;t think about your baby...and that is O.K., too. </p>

            <p>You are not alone. When the doctor told us our daughter&#39;s heart had stopped beating at 40 weeks and three days, I felt like I flew off the face of the earth. I didn&#39;t feel like a part of the world anymore, I felt like my husband and I were alone, different, isolated. I had no idea so many families had gone through what we did. Find those people. In a local support group, among friends, online, they are out there. These are the people who will say your child&#39;s name, remember birthdays, not judge you when cry over a friend&#39;s pregnancy announcement and be as furious as you are over the ridiculous, hurtful things people say to you.  </p>

<p>Stillbirth changes you. Some people will support you unconditionally, but some will never understand why you can&#39;t just get over it and be the person you used to be. It&#39;s O.K. to let those people fall out of your life. Maybe it will be for a short time, maybe forever, but the people who say your child&#39;s name with you, who do not expect you to be the same person you were before your child died, those people are precious. Hold on to to those people.  </p>

<p>Ramona is our daughter. Nothing about her death is easier because she was in our life for such a short time. She is our first, beautiful child. Death does not change that. Our family and close friends have been amazing, but the baby loss community has helped us so much. Please know you are not alone. We are out there, ready to remember your child with you.</p>

          <div class="text">
            <p>I went into labor on Friday, Nov. 11, 2011. I was almost 37 weeks pregnant. When my husband and I arrived at the hospital, the nurses were unable to find a heartbeat. I delivered our son, Kenneth, at 12:31 a.m. on Saturday. We held Kenny for hours and introduced him to his grandparents. Pictures, a lock of hair and footprints are the few pieces of physical evidence of Kenny’s existence. Regretfully, we do not have pictures of us holding Kenny. </p>

<p>There were many things that helped us in the short-term. I had the support of friends who experienced losses. Hearing their stories and receiving their advice helped to push me through some of the worst days. We had an informal memorial service with family members. Then, we went away for a week. The trip gave us much needed private time for remembering and deciding how to move forward. After our trip, we took on new hobbies to pass the quiet time. I also spent the next several months learning about stillbirth, trying to understand the grief process,and looking for ways to make meaning out of our loss. </p>

<p>I still think about Kenny every day. Sometimes I think about my gratitude for having known Kenny; sometimes my thoughts are more painful and leave me gasping for air. We had the good fortune of having twin girls in 2013 and another baby girl in 2014. Our two-year-old twins can say Kenny’s name. We wish others were not hesitant or afraid to speak about him. It hurts to think about what happened to Kenny, but it hurts much more to think that he has been forgotten. </p>

            <p>The numbness set in. The kind that makes every sound you hear mumbled and every sight you see blurry. &quot;She&#39;s gone.&quot; Like a skipping record playing endlessly in my head. She&#39;s gone. 33 weeks and my daughter is gone; along with the rest of me. When did I let this happen? Where did I fail? Why am I being punished? Question after question flooded my brain. How can I fix it? What bargain can I make with God to make it all a mistake? To make her &quot;O.K.?&quot; </p>

<p>No bargain, no mistake, no failure, just a beautiful baby girl born still into this world. No heart could love so much or hurt so much simultaneously. I was forever changed. I was a mother. Reagan Elizabeth Ricketts made me a mother. Not the mother I thought I would be, but a mother all the same. </p>

<p>You ARE a mother. Don&#39;t let go. Don&#39;t let go of the things you dreamed of doing when you would first meet your baby. Name her. Hold her. Kiss her. Count her fingers and toes. Don&#39;t let go of sharing her with those who love her. Cry. Smile. Take pictures. Don&#39;t let go of her being yours. Rock her. Swaddle her. Sing to her. Don&#39;t let go of being her mother. Talk about her. Share what she means to you. Acknowledge how she&#39;s changed you. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t let go of her memory, because it will never let go of you.</p>

            <p>For me one of the most difficult pieces of this incredible loss is what comes after. This Sept. 10, it will mark 37 years since I delivered a stillborn son and I still think about him. Things were different back then, no one asked if I wanted to hold him. My husband saw him and said he looked just like our first born son who was five at the time. Two years later, we were blessed with a daughter. My children are seven and one half years apart. This is not by choice. When the subject of  children comes up in conversations, people are surprised by the large age difference. I get very quiet. Sometimes I explain and sometimes I just look away and say nothing. </p>

<p>Stillbirth forever changes your outlook on pregnancy. Forever! When my daughter was pregnant she knew that I would never, ever purchase a baby item until the baby was safely in the world. I was there for the delivery of my granddaughter. It was very, very difficult for me, but I did it! After she came blue and screaming into the world, I collapsed in the bathroom. </p>

<p>When I delivered my daughter the doctor told me I had to start pushing -- I said &quot;no.&quot; I was in another world and I was happy because my baby was with me. I was terrified that if I delivered I&#39;d have to go through that anguish again. Thankfully, I did not.</p>

            <p>Don&#39;t blame yourself. We don&#39;t understand why, but there was a reason. Losing him helped me appreciate the fragility of life. Keep the child alive in your heart. In my experience, the mother feels the loss more deeply because she has known the baby and bonded with him/her more intricately than anyone else. We had a funeral. Douglas was almost full term, but the umbilical cord was wrapped around his neck. There are special grieving groups. The one that helped me the most was gathering with other couples on the hospital grounds, and tying a pink or blue ribbon, with the baby&#39;s name on it, to the branches of a young tree. It was symbolic, but yet it commemorated the birth and the loss simultaneously. We got a puppy four days after losing the baby. We hadn&#39;t planned on it, but in some ways caring for an animal helped ease the pain, and gave me something to nurture and look after. I gave birth to two more boys after him. I gave my next son the same middle name to help him live on in our hearts, thoughts and minds. My mother lost a son, too. His name was Douglas. Unless someone has experienced this loss and the &quot;empty arms&quot; they can&#39;t understand how deeply the mother is affected. Take the time to grieve and heal. We had him buried next to his grandmother, in the hope and belief that she could comfort him and hold him in her loving arms instead of ours. We&#39;d have probably not planned a birth two years later, had Douglas lived. And we&#39;d never have known or bonded with our precious mini dachshund...Rocky. Douglas Matthew is gone, but never forgotten. July 5, 1993 is forever his &quot;birth&quot; day.</p>

            <p>Our car wouldn&#39;t start on the way to the hospital. I thought: what a funny story to tell our child! I hate that I will never have the chance to tell him about the car, to teach him how to tie his shoes, to show him how to be kind, to see the wonders of the world through his eyes. Our son, Henry, died. I was 39 weeks pregnant and in the throes of labor when we found out. His delivery was heartbreakingly painful and equally magical. Holding him, kissing him, stroking his cheeks-these moments literally feel etched into my soul. To anyone who must endure such pain, take time and take pictures. Hold your child for as long as you can, even though it will never be long enough. Take pictures even if it feels weird. Name your child, and say it over and over again. In the days, weeks and months following Henry&#39;s death we tried to follow our nurse&#39;s advice: do only what energizes you. For us this meant declining visitors we didn&#39;t want, spreading Henry&#39;s ashes in our sacred place, taking time to return to work, taking walks and watching silly TV shows. Finally, it is never too late to send a birth announcement, to plan a memorial, to hang a picture of your child in your home, to read a book to your child, to join a support group, to find a therapist, or to honor your child in whatever way feels right to you.</p>

            <p>Placental abruption caused our loss during the early stages of labor. By the time we got to the doctor it was too late.  The doctor had us walk all the way down a long hallway to the hospital to get another ultrasound rather than delivering the news to us in his office. I was stuck in an unending contraction. Finally, I asked my husband to get me a nurse and a wheel chair. The doctor came and finalized the news that we had lost our son. All night long we could hear other babies being born. I&#39;ll always remember what an amazing euphoric feeling I had when I pushed him out in to the world. This was immediately followed with such a profound conflicting feeling of loss from the silence. The loss felt like a bottomless pit and I had no idea how I was going to take the next breath. My only regret is that we would have gotten to hold our son longer. I felt like we had to rush our time with him. I didn&#39;t know what the rules were and was still in too much shock to even ask. Our baby, Erik JorEl Robinson was perfect. The next day one of our colleagues came to visit and gave us books to read -- which helped. The statistics are high from marriages ending in divorce from a loss of a child - ours was one.  At our second son&#39;s wedding, his father took a moment and quietly said to me, that we lost so much when we lost Erik. We were both lost and we did not talk or even cry together. And now 30 years later, we still wish we had.</p>

          <div class="text">
            <p>40 years ago this Oct. 11th, I delivered a full-term, stillborn son. I had been to the doctor the week before and everything was fine so you can imagine my total shock in the delivery room when I didn&#39;t hear him cry. It was then I found out he was stillborn. They had rushed him out without even letting me see him. I had to go through hell to get them to bring him up from the morgue. Even then they would not allow me to hold him. They had him wrapped in white wax paper. He had all his toes, fingers everything. I was totally devastated. They wouldn&#39;t give a death certificate. The worst part was walking out of the hospital two days later knowing I was leaving my son there. I tried to bury the pain and agony of this as I had two other little ones at home and didn&#39;t want to upset them.  People would say, &quot;Well you&#39;re better off, he probably wasn&#39;t healthy.&quot; How heartless to say that to a grieving mother. I held that pain inside for so long it almost destroyed me. I advise to anyone going through this, don&#39;t hold the pain in, grieve for your child. Whether they take that first breath or not doesn&#39;t make it any easier, and people  making  horrible statements thinking they are helping you, ignore them. To this day, I still see him when I close my eyes, although we had no time together, I love him still, he will be forever in my heart.  </p>

            <p>I gave birth to my first and only child at 34 weeks. I noticed that Ella had stopped moving and immediately went to the ER where they couldn&#39;t find her heartbeat. I was admitted and induced, and gave birth to my perfect baby girl about 24 hours later. It is the most surreal experience. You will feel rushed and bombarded with information, but take your time. Spend as much time with your child as you feel you&#39;d like to, and don&#39;t let anyone hurry you along. Ask if the hospital has a cuddle cot that allows you more time with your child before their body starts to change. Have family come and see the baby, cry and just be with them, together. Have someone go out and buy an outfit so you can bathe and clothe them. Take lots of pictures - you don&#39;t have to look at them but believe me, you&#39;ll be glad you have them. Ask about professional photographers, impressions and prints of hands and feet, locks of hair. Discuss with your partner at length what you want as the next steps -- don&#39;t let them talk you out of an autopsy because &quot;most of the time we don&#39;t know why.&quot; Maybe you&#39;ll get answers, maybe you won&#39;t, but you can&#39;t go back. Above all, remember that you did nothing wrong, it was not your fault, and no one would have loved or cared for that baby any better than you did. You are a parent. Your child and your unconditional love is real, and irreplaceable. </p>

            <p>I would tell them to talk about the baby. We lost our daughter at 36 weeks. My friends didn&#39;t know how to handle it, so their way of dealing with it was to not talk about her. They acted like we never had a baby. I had to deal with the realization that we are not immortal. Allow yourself to go through the emotions. The first was shock, then anger and sadness and finally peace. After we lost her, all I wanted to do was hold a baby and rock.  One of my best friends had a little boy, 2 weeks after we had Laurel. She let me rock Andy. She was the only one that seemed to understand the need to hold a baby. I will be indebted to her for life. I would tell them to hold the baby. I tried memorizing her features, her small hands and feet, her blond hair. The nurses were wonderful when we had her.  They treated her birth with respect. Everyone grieves differently.  Don&#39;t feel that there is a certain way to grieve. It seems like it will never get better, but it does. </p>

            <p>In May of 2013 my husband and I got pregnant for the first time. A baby girl. Everyone was so excited but me. I never wanted to be a mother and hated every minute of being pregnant. I even yelled at her once when she got the hiccups because it was “so annoying.” I didn’t bond with her or start to get excited until the day of her baby shower, Jan. 19th, 2014.</p>

<p>When we found out at 40 weeks, 3 days that our baby girl was dead before she was born my heart shattered and my soul darkened. I was inconsolable and almost refused to hold her. However, when I did finally hold her I broke even more and handed her back to the nurse with eyes full of tears. This is my biggest regret...not spending any time with her. I didn’t bathe her or kiss her. I didn’t take the time to be her mother. I was too devastated and didn’t know I would need to in order to heal properly. Before leaving the hospital they gave us a memory box that had a memory stick with a few pictures, a lock of her hair, her right hand print and right foot print, the outfit they put her in, and the quilt they had her wrapped up in.</p>

<p>Obviously it is too late for me. My daughter has been gone for over a year now. If you have just suffered the same tragic loss as I did I beg you.....PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE spend time with your child. Bathe them, kiss them, take as many pictures as you can. Do NOT be afraid to mother your child because even though they are not breathing you are still their mother and once they leave the room they are not coming back!</p>

            <p>I can tell you that you will always remember this moment. Those few precious minutes or hours you spent with your baby will be a part of you forever and you will spend the rest of your life digging into your memory to reclaim them. Hold close to the memories and never let anyone tell you to let them go. Many people will tell you how to grieve, but unless they have been through this, they don&#39;t know what they are talking about. Ignore them. Even if they have been through a stillbirth, each experience is as unique as you are. That&#39;s why you need to claim your story as your own, because only you can tell it. Write it, speak it, record it in whichever way you feel comfortable. Share it so others know you are not alone.</p>

            <p>My son, Jacob, was stillborn in February. I read once that losing a parent is like losing your past, losing a spouse is like losing your present, and losing a child is like losing your future. My future is not how I had imagined it would be during my pregnancy, and I am still figuring out how to make the future beautiful and meaningful without my son physically here. One thing I do feel really strongly about is that since my son doesn&#39;t get the opportunity to live and see the world for himself, it is my job to living a life in honor of him, and I resolve to see the world for him. I wish the world would understand that stillborn babies are beautiful, and they are real. Parents of stillborn children are parents. It is a horrible club to be in but with one with such kind, open-hearted, and supportive members. If you are a parent who has experienced this excruciating loss, I am so deeply sorry you find yourself on this path. If you have not lost a child, thank you for sitting with us. Most of us like to talk about and remember our babies, and you can help by being present with us. If I could make people understand one thing about my experience, it is simply that I love my son. I will love him every minute of every day for the rest of my life.</p>

          <div class="text">
            <p>I was 19 weeks and 6 days when I had my son. I had been up all night with cramping and we decided to go to the emergency room. As soon as we got there, my water broke. The doctors refused to move us into labor and delivery because I was mere hours from the 20 weeks cutoff. After being my own advocate and threatening to sue the doctor, I was moved up there. The staff was wonderful and kind during delivery and my night nurse in postpartum was an angel. They took photos and imprints of his feet. I got to bathe him, dress him, and hold him for 30 hours. At the end of 30 hours, they came in and said enough is enough. They didn&#39;t let us say our final goodbyes. They pulled him from my arms and walked away as I pleaded to go with him. We chose to have him cremated. It&#39;s hard to make these decisions you never dream of having to make in a matter of hours: burial or cremation, name or no name, funeral home or let the hospital plan the &quot;disposal&quot;, etc. It was hard leaving him alone in the hospital. My only thoughts were that he was cold and alone and scared. For days I would drive to the hospital and sit outside on the curb at the entrance because I wanted him to know he was never alone. I wish they explained what to watch for while pregnant that could indicate a problem. I wish more obstetricians would take a pregnant woman&#39;s concerns seriously. I wish people understood how losing a child to stillbirth is devastating and will change who you are at your core.</p>

            <p>In 2003, our first son, Jesper, was born still at 41 weeks. Like so many other families, we do not know what happened. I had a textbook pregnancy; he was perfect. Twelve years later, his death, our loss, still hurts indescribably. Some days hurt more than others, but always just under the surface. There is nothing in life that is not affected by his absence. His younger siblings are a joy and a blessing, but they are also a reminder of his absence. There is nothing they do in life that I don&#39;t think, &quot;This should not be the first time.&quot; I have found healing in sharing his story and helping others. I have turned my pain into motivation and used it to change laws. None of what I have done or accomplished since his death has taken away the loss, the grief, or the silent guilt that I carry. No, there was nothing I did or didn&#39;t do to cause his death, and yet...he was in what was supposed to be the safest place on Earth and I failed at keeping him alive. I failed, no one else. His death forever changed me in profound ways. I am, however, also grateful in a way for his death. His siblings would not exist if he were here. I have met some amazing people in the process of living after his death. I have found strength and courage and determination within me that I might never have known otherwise. I have done things many people call &quot;impossible.&quot; I am able to see the gifts he left behind, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that I would have given my life for his. It doesn&#39;t mean his death doesn&#39;t hurt me every single day of my life. </p>

            <p>I would share that the time in the womb with this baby was very precious and could be looked at as the unique relationship that you will have with this soul. Also the dreams that you have during and afterward are important. I had a very important dream during the emergency C-section when I was under anesthesia where I saw the baby be handed to my sister who had died several years earlier. It was comforting initially. It was the way I knew when I woke up, that the baby was not alive. The dreams afterward were about having to release her back to the unknown, and helped me slowly accept that all the plans I had were not going to happen. I actually found a depth of experience in life that I did not have before, and allowed myself to feel more deeply. I learned something new and precious about life and death after experiencing the stillbirth of my baby. I often refer to it as the gift this soul gave me.  I had two older children, and I felt it was very important for them to have time to acknowledge that they had a sister who passed on. Initially I wanted them to see her, but they were not able to come to the hospital in time before there were changes to the baby. The staff was willing to keep the baby nearby until I was ready. Somehow I needed to see the body color to change to believe she was dead. Even then, once I had a kind of hallucination that the baby appeared alive next to me. This event inspired me to celebrate every year those of our family who passed on with photos on November 2, All Souls Day.</p>

            <p>On July 11, 1998, my beautiful son Edward Maxwell was delivered.  Earlier that day I had attended a funeral.  During the funeral he danced in my stomach.  I joked with the baby (did not know if it was a boy or girl) that this was not the appropriate behavior for such an occasion. Later that night, the dancing stopped. I began to feel pain and realized I was in labor. Once we arrived at the hospital, an excited nurse looked at me and confirmed my joyful suspicion by saying, &quot;Honey you are in labor!&quot; It was so exciting! Then it was horrifying and sad and scary. I woke from my c-section to the sound of my father wailing. I will never forget that painful cry. I held sweet Max for several hours sometime during that night. I did not want to let him go. The next days were surreal -- stunned friends not knowing what to say, family members with swollen eyes, funerals. I would tell those who have a stillborn to definitely hold that sweet baby for as long as they can. Take pictures. I only have one and I cherish it. Let people help you and talk about your loss. Grieve and heal. Choose to heal and live on. There are many wonderful things that await mothers and fathers. Whether you have more children or not, you are in the sacred group called parents. Cherish your memories and keep your story alive. Talk to your child in whatever scared place you think they may be. Be kind to your partner and take care of yourself.</p>

            <p>Whatever you feel, whatever you need, it&#39;s all good. Don&#39;t judge yourself. I’ve gone through such a storm of emotions since losing my son Daniel. From extreme jealousy when seeing other (pregnant) mothers to overwhelming gratitude to have had those special and life changing 6 months with him. The moment they told me my baby’s heartbeat had stopped, my life became this absurd parallel universe, where somehow I managed to not fall apart. Going through labor and eventually giving birth to my stillborn son has been a blessing in disguise. It felt like the only thing I could still do was to give him a sacred and loving welcome into this world. The fact that he never took his first breath is irrelevant to me, my son was born and he has touched this earth. It was when leaving the hospital with empty arms and broken hearts that I started to fall apart. Not once, but over and over again these past 12 months. I’ve found grief to be a tricky thing. It can disappear for a while, but when it comes back it hits you so hard you think you’re going to drown. Realizing this grief comes and goes in waves has helped me not to panic every time the wave hits. Even though I absolutely don&#39;t wish what happened to us upon anyone, I&#39;ve longed to hear the stories of other women who&#39;ve gone through this heartbreak, because this is such a lonely road. Babies are not supposed to die, but they do and too few people talk about it. We are mothers, we have mothered our babies and all of our children will forever be a part of who we are. I believe their names deserve to be named and their stories are worth telling.</p>

              <q>Those pregnancies were different; no longer naive, we held our breath until those beautiful squalling babies were placed in our arms.</q>
            
          </div>
          <div class="text">
            <p>This happened to me 28 years ago. We, too, lost our first child, a son, at 20 weeks. All I have left is one small photo and his impossibly tiny footprints.</p>

<p>The pain is intolerable at first. I didn&#39;t want to see anyone, and I cried for weeks. Constantly. It is so difficult to reconcile birth and death happening at the same time. During labor I kept thinking &quot;born to die,&quot; it didn&#39;t make sense.</p>

<p>The silence during labor and delivery is stark. Even after the birth, no one said anything and I had to ask the baby&#39;s sex. When they said it was a boy, I heard my husband choking back sobs, the first time I ever saw him cry. We had only been married 5 months, this was a surprise &quot;honeymoon&quot; baby. &quot;For better or worse&quot; came very soon for us.</p>

<p>People would tell me that we could try again, that it was God&#39;s way, etc. This was not helpful. The only thing that helps is time, and that only softens the pain, it doesn&#39;t remove it. You will always love your baby and you will miss him with a visceral ache for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>We did get pregnant again and our beloved daughter was born 14 months after our loss. We had our second daughter 3 years later. Those pregnancies were different; no longer naive, we held our breath until those beautiful squalling babies were placed in our arms. I am aware that if not for our loss, we wouldn&#39;t have our oldest daughter, who we love beyond measure.</p>

<p>I am not a religiously  observant person, but if there is a heaven I know what it is: my baby boy, reunited with us forever.  </p>

              <q>Family and friends need to see that the baby was a real person.</q>

          <div class="text">
            <p>Twenty-eight years ago when our baby was born, my midwife said: &quot;He&#39;s beautiful!&quot; A remembered happiness in an unbearable sorrow.</p>

<p>And as my midwife also said: He&#39;s your baby and you can do what you want to do. If you want to take him home -- you can. If you want to stay overnight with him here--you can.</p>

<p>We opted to stay overnight and she arranged for us to be on another floor. I bathed him and dressed him in take-home clothes and blanket and slept with him all night in my arms.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget your camera bag. I left it at home at the last minute because I thought people would think I had gone off the deep end. </p>

<p>If we had to do it over again, I would probably walk out with the baby in my arms and go home to make arrangements for a wake and a funeral. Family and friends need to see that the baby was a real person.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be afraid to grieve deeply for as long as you need, because your heart will break a hundred times a day when you think of your missing baby. Know that one day your unbearable sorrow will lift from your shoulders and fly away up into the sky. Your life will return to normal, and you will love and laugh again, perhaps more so because of the hole in your heart.</p>

<p>Parents never, ever get over the death of a child. When I die, I&#39;ll get over it, but not till then. </p>

            <p>Don&#39;t be scared to talk about your baby. It&#39;s O.K. to be sad that your baby died and still be proud of him or her. We have children that we will not get to introduce to our friends and family or strangers that we meet, who unknowingly ask whether we have children or how many children we have. But, it&#39;s O.K. to mention their names or say how old they would be. Don&#39;t deny yourself the joy of being a parent to your child, even if he or she is no longer living. Remember them. Talk about them. Tell their siblings about them. Share memories of your pregnancy and time with your baby after delivery.</p>

<p>Time and time again, I have been told that this happens more than people realize. The statistics are staggering. 1 in 160 pregnancies in the U.S. ends in stillbirth. Almost half of stillbirths remain unexplained, like ours. Yet I had never heard of a healthy baby, especially full term, just dying in utero with no explanation.  It’s something people don’t want to talk about. It’s sad and it’s scary, because it seems like there is nothing anyone can do to stop it from happening. A few weeks or a couple months go by, and people stop mentioning your baby or asking how you’re feeling. Eventually, mothers and fathers of stillborn babies may stop talking about it as well, because they don’t want to make others uncomfortable. So, stillbirth remains this thing that happens, even frequently, but no one mentions or does anything about. We do a disservice to our sons and daughters when we perpetuate that silence.</p>

          <div class="text">
            <p>This July I will be 26. I have a loving, soon-to-be husband, an extremely amusing daughter and another little girl on the way. Outwardly my family must seem pretty ordinary, but every time someone asks about my children I take those few minutes to pretend that my daughter Estella didn’t die at 37 weeks. </p>

<p>I pretend she was born squalling and pink, and although her father swears her eyes would have been blue, I know they would have been brown. She favored me with her olive complexion and thick, dark curls. I pretend that at home I have an almost 2-year-old and a 9-month-old, and that my hands are insanely full but I am having a great time being a mom all the same. With a smile I laugh about how I’m excited for a third, when the truth is I would love more children but cannot handle the emotional stress of another pregnancy. It’s hard to enjoy such a beautiful thing when you feel the only memories of one of your children slowly slipping away. </p>

<p>I pretend that I’m not scared I’ll forget how her skin was cool when it should have been warm, or how soft and fine her hair felt beneath my fingers. I never mention how I seriously thought about running away from the hospital with her if only so I wouldn’t have to endure the pain of giving her back. Sometimes that’s all I can do to get through the day. I am not ashamed or afraid to say that my daughter died, but every now and then I like to imagine a world where she didn’t because every morning when I wake up I always remember that one of my children has died.</p>

              <q>I volunteer with a bereavement ministry at my church and see this as a way of honoring Michael’s memory in a tangible way.</q>
            
          </div>
          <div class="text">
            <p>My husband and I lost our first-born son, Michael, to stillbirth 24 years ago. He was a week overdue and just stopped moving. Testing afterwards provided no reason for his death. After the surreal experience of delivering a baby and coming home with empty arms, we tried to make sense of what had happened and go on with our lives. The grief was painful and devastating, with many ups and downs that can still take me by surprise today. We were especially helped by attending a support group for people who have experienced stillbirth, miscarriage and early infant death (Unite in Philadelphia). Some family and friends were wonderful while others just didn’t understand that this was truly a loss for us. Supporting one another was tough at times, too, as men and women often grieve differently. We were later blessed to have two healthy children, but they are not replacements for their brother.</p>

<p>Now, many years later, I wonder what Michael would be like, had he lived. I consider myself a mother of three, despite not having many opportunities to speak of Michael and his short yet important life. Michael has greatly enriched my life and I can now find positive impacts of his death in addition to the painful ones. My appreciation for life and understanding of death is deepened, though I still have many questions. I volunteer with a bereavement ministry at my church and see this as a way of honoring Michael’s memory in a tangible way. I am forever changed.</p>

            <p>My wife, Vicki, and I were anticipating the birth of our first child together. Noah’s due date was April 21. I’ll never forget the feelings of exhilaration and joy that overcame me when we first heard his heartbeat.</p>

<p>Nothing could have prepared me for how I would feel when his heartbeat stopped on Dec. 22.</p>

<p>Vicki was admitted to the hospital on Dec. 19 with HELLP syndrome, a rare form of preeclampsia that afflicts 48,000 mothers every year in the United States.</p>

<p>Once a mother has HELLP syndrome, if the baby is not delivered soon, she will die. But Vicki wasn’t even 23 weeks pregnant. How could we give an order to deliver Noah, knowing our innocent baby, through no fault of his own, would die?</p>

<p>We had to. Vicki’s platelets were plummeting. Blood transfusions were discussed. We couldn’t wait for Noah to develop any more.</p>

<p>We tell ourselves the choice was made to save Vicki’s life, not to end Noah’s. No matter how true that is, it doesn’t alleviate the pain of having to finalize your son’s death sentence. </p>

<p>At 2:42 a.m., three days before Christmas, Noah Gabriel came into the world, stillborn at 10.5 inches and three-quarters of a pound. His grandparents, aunts and uncles were there to see him. They all added a touch of normalcy to an unenviable situation.</p>

<p>We kept Noah for one day. We took pictures. Initially I thought we took too many, but now it seems we don’t have enough. In the moment, it was hard to grasp how finite those moments with him were. I’ll always wish I held him and kissed him one more time. Fathers feel guilty when their child is stillborn, too. It’s a loss and a journey of grief both parents walk together. A journey no one should have to take.</p>

            <p>We are only three and a half months into the grieving process so we are learning as we go. Our situation is unique in that we lost our baby boy twin at 34 weeks unexpectedly, but we have his twin sister. Yes we will always have a constant reminder of our loss, but we feel fortunate to have her. </p>

<p>If I could talk to someone who has experienced the same, I would tell them first of all that it just sucks. It&#39;s probably one of the worst things someone can go through.There is no magical phrase to take the hurt away. I wish there was. Grief is unpredictable, so it is O.K. to have good and bad days. For us, talking about it has helped......especially with your spouse. And just know that you are not alone. We have also attended a monthly support group which is beneficial to see people face to face that have also been through the same horrible thing. Let yourself cry, be angry, or whatever you are feeling. All of your feelings are valid. </p>

<p>We are currently struggling with the fact that no one wants to talk about it...our society is so afraid of it. And honestly, the silence makes it worse. Don&#39;t be afraid to talk about it, say their name, and continue to honor them however you see fit for the rest of your life. There will never be a day that you don&#39;t think about them. And don&#39;t listen if someone tells you &quot;It&#39;s part of god&#39;s plan or it happened for a reason&quot;....they have obviously never lost a child.</p>

            <p>Our son, Rhys, was stillborn on July 13, 2014 at 37 weeks. Everyone wants to know what I will do on the anniversary of his death. For me, the anniversary is just another day among all days of the year, probably for the rest of my life, on which I think of Rhys. One of the hardest moments in the hospital was when they finally took his body away from me. It felt as unnatural, wrenching, and wrong as I imagine it feels to have an organ or a limb taken from your body while you are awake. He belonged with me, and if he could not live his own life, then I just wanted them to put him back inside me. I know how horrendous that sounds, but I find that many mothers of stillborn babies felt the same way.</p>

<p>I think I will always feel that Rhys is missing. But what I have learned this year is that is O.K. For some things, like the loss of a child, there may never be closure the way our culture often wants closure. For me, it’s O.K. to still feel sad and to let that feeling weave itself into the larger fabric of my life.</p>

<p>We may not realize how many people we already know who put on a &quot;good face,&quot; but inside are consumed by the panic-inducing emptiness of missing someone who has left a permanent hole. People often think that it will be easier to recover from a stillbirth because parents never get to know their child. I thought that too, before I lost Rhys. But I can tell you that when I saw Rhys, I felt as though I had known him forever, and I was, and still am, overwhelmed by the love I feel for him everyday.</p>

            <p>My daughter would turn seven on July 2, but Avery was stillborn just before her due date. It seems like forever since I stared into her face, an eternity since I ran my fingers across her lips. One muggy June night my water broke and my daughter died. Avery&#39;s ashes now sit in my bedroom, in a little silver container that gets kissed every night. The pathologist&#39;s report labeled the cause of death &quot;asphyxia due to nuchal cord,&quot; which, to be blunt, means my daughter was strangled by her own cord.</p>

<p>Losing Avery was devastating. I had a healthy pregnancy, and I couldn&#39;t understand how my body failed. My world collapsed, and the future I&#39;d envisioned for our family of three became a desolate landscape of two. We were given the most incredible gift only to have it taken away in a literal heartbeat, left tortured by unanswered questions, haunted by what-ifs.</p>

<p>On July 22, my oldest son turns six. Time flies, but I know how I got here. After Avery, I had to try immediately or give up.  I was pregnant a month after my doctor said go, and 385 days after Avery&#39;s birth I delivered my son.</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t cure my grief.  He didn&#39;t miraculously fill the hole in my heart. I&#39;d see Avery in him, and I&#39;d sob hysterically because I had to dress him in blue instead of the pink clothes tucked away in storage. Stillbirth isn&#39;t something you &quot;get over.&quot; It&#39;s something you learn to live with, an invisible scar that represents both misery and strength. When my second son arrived in 2011 I was finally able to breathe, to accept my story as it was written and be happy with both the laughter and the tears. I miss Avery, but I&#39;ve found peace.</p>

            <p>It was Dec. 24, 1967. I was due to delivery my first baby. I was healthy at age 19. The pregnancy was normal and I felt wonderful throughout. The week before due date I could not feel movement.</p>

<p>At this time, ultrasound was not available. The doctors could not find a heartbeat prior to delivery.  No one told me that I could be giving birth to stillborn.  I somehow knew that things were not going to turn out the way I hoped.</p>

<p>The delivery was normal. I looked up at the doctor and he was shaking his head. I said what is wrong, what is wrong with my baby. He just shook his head and held up the umbilical cord which was tied in a tight knot. I said oh no and started to cry. I said is he normal and he said perfectly normal otherwise.</p>

<p>I never had the opportunity to see my baby like they do these modern days. I never held him or said goodbye. He was whisked away and my husband came in crying. My first feeling was anger. Anger that this stupid accident had happened to me.</p>

<p>Things are so much better now for stillbirths. They treat it like live birth. You have a chance to hold, to love and to caress your baby and say goodbye and remember his face.  </p>

<p>I am at peace with the loss but it took a lot of years to overcome my anger and grief. My son was not named at birth and was buried in family plot under stone marked “Baby.”  I recently had the stone replaced with a name I had for him, James Lincoln.</p>

<p>I will always  miss you, Baby James.</p>

          <div class="text">
            <p>After I lost my daughter Dakota Marie at eight months I felt guilty and ashamed. I felt that I didn&#39;t do enough. That day in the hospital room was the worst day of my life. The silence and pain we all felt was unbearable. After hours of labor she arrived. Not hearing her cry killed me. In the days that followed I was so numb to everything. My husband would try to stay strong for me but I would catch him breaking down at times. The funeral was a blur, it was so hard to go through the process of burying a child. No parent should have to go through that. Shortly after this I found out I was pregnant again, this time with twin girls. I should&#39;ve felt excited but all I felt was fear. That whole pregnancy was terrifying because I didn&#39;t want history to repeat itself. In the end my girls came into this world healthy and strong. Everyone tells me my girls are my blessings and they are right. To this day I still question why God took my baby and doubt my faith. But I know she is in a place of no pain and she is still with me in spirit. What I want other parents to know is the pain never goes away but it can get easier. Your children will always be with you. That bond doesn&#39;t go away. I&#39;ve found out whether it&#39;s family or friends or even strangers, you always have someone to talk to. I&#39;ve found looking into groups and talking to people who have been through the same thing can help greatly. It&#39;s hard to be strong but it&#39;s possible to be strong.</p>

            <p>You are not alone. The pain and heartache are gut-wrenching, and you may feel numbness along with shock. The early months following the loss of my firstborn son, Duncan, were the toughest. </p>

<p>It was mid-November and we were expecting another baby in December, and we were ecstatic about the homebirth we were planning. Deep down I sensed something was off, but I didn&#39;t want to allow my mind to go there. I didn&#39;t want whatever I was feeling to be true.</p>

<p>I remember the events surrounding the moment I knew he was gone so vividly. The silence on the other end of the doppler was like a punch in the gut, and I knew in that moment he was gone. Despite everything going on, the realization that our baby boy died, I looked forward to seeing him. I couldn&#39;t wait to see and hold him in my arms. That time is precious, and if I could relive any moment in my life, it would be those moments, the moments I held my beautiful, sweet boy in my arms.</p>

<p>My advice to other bereaved parents, surround yourself with a great support system and be gentle to yourself. You <em>don&#39;t</em> need to be strong. Be present in your emotions, however raw and painful they are. Your life will never be &quot;normal&quot; again, but you can discover a new normal. As time continues, you will find a place in your life for your grief, because the pain and hurt never go away. </p>

<p>And remember, you&#39;re not alone.</p>

          <div class="text">
            <p>We lost our first daughter, Dena, at almost 30 weeks in 1998. It was an uneventful pregnancy that was progressing as normal. Preterm labor began suddenly and a congenital birth defect was discovered. We were told our baby would not survive after delivery. I delivered after a few hours of labor that was accelerated by pitocin.</p>

<p>The grief was unspeakable in those first hours, but we were lucky to receive a visit from fellow temple members whom we did not know well. They came to see us within a couple of hours of learning what had happened. They sat with us and shared their story of neonatal loss. Their visit was a gift to us, helping us realize we were not alone and better days (and future pregnancies) were possible. </p>

<p>We were surprised to hear so many other stories of stillbirth after ours. How could that be? No one ever spoke of it, yet it seemed everyone knew someone who had experienced loss. </p>

<p>I thought of the visit from fellow congregants often those first days and weeks, and eventually realized that maybe someday I could provide the same sort of comfort to a grieving parent. That, too, gave me comfort. </p>

<p>No one wants to be a member of this exclusive club, but we can reach out to support each other. No one needs to go through stillbirth alone. I don&#39;t want to receive the call, but I know my husband and I would drop everything to sit and share with a grieving couple in the hospital on a Saturday night. </p>

          <div class="text">
            <p>My sister Máire Bríd was stillborn. My mother says that, two days before her due date, her little baby stopped moving and that she almost ran to the hospital, knowing something was terribly wrong.</p>

<p>At the hospital they couldn’t find a heartbeat. Two days later she was born: perfect and beautiful, but without life. There was no sound, no cry, no hope she might have even a brief time with her heartbroken parents.</p>

<p>The nurses wanted to take her away. “Give her to me,” my mother said through her tears, and she held her baby to her as if she could will the life-force back into her. But she was gone, born sleeping as we say now, one of God’s angels.</p>

<p>My mother said she would have given anything, anything at all, to have had her baby live even for one short moment after birth, to have touched her warm face and stroke her tiny hand, to pour a lifetime of love into that fleeting minute. But it wasn’t to be. The loss of that time haunted her. It broke her heart.</p>

<p>Parents weren’t encouraged back then to hold their babies, or to make memories of their too-short lives. That denial just made everything harder. </p>

<p>But then we went to a Remembrance Day organized by a group called Every Life Counts.</p>

<p>My mother sat with Fiona, who lost her little boy, Andrew, to anencephaly, and they talked about their babies who they had loved so much for that brief time, and for ever after. And then they took each other’s sorrow and released it a little from the deepest fissures of their hearts.</p>

<p>So I was reminded that, with great love, we can help each other through the very worst of times, and we can heal those long-ago losses that still break too many hearts.</p>

            <p>Lilly Jean Braun is our daughter who was born still on Jan. 7, 2014.  That was her due date, the date we had been counting down to, repeating to friends, family, co-workers and strangers, the date our lives would change forever but not in the way we anticipated. We went in for our 40 week appointment brought our hospital bag thinking this could be the day but were told instead that our daughter had no heartbeat. I delivered her later that night to a silent delivery room except for the cries of my husband and I. They were never able to tell us what happened to Lilly, it is still a mystery as to what happened. As a mother who has experienced a stillbirth and it still standing, I would tell others now faced with the loss to keep parenting your child even though he or she is not physically with you. Talk to your child, talk about your child, he or she is a part of your family and deserves to be recognized as such. Be kind to yourself -- I spent so much time blaming myself, wondering what I did wrong, asking if there was something else I could have done. You must move forward and not look back. Be kind to your partner -- they also suffered a loss and although you may grieve differently you need each other and need to support each other. You will learn that others around you will forget and will be insensitive. Mother’s Day, baby showers, birthday parties will be hard. Don’t make yourself go if you don’t want to. And it’s OK to be angry. More than anything I felt at first utter heartbreak and then anger. But talking about Lilly subdued my anger. Have hope. There will be a day without tears. </p>

            <p>My sons are Henry Francis and Emmett Lee. Both were still born on Jan. 6, 2012 and Aug. 20, 2013, respectively. Those were the two hardest and saddest days of my life. There is nothing more joyful and exciting than to go to the doctor&#39;s office and watch your first child&#39;s heartbeat on the monitor for the very first time. Adversely, there is nothing more heartbreaking then looking at that same monitor at 27 weeks and the doctor telling you that she is sorry that she can&#39;t find a heartbeat and your baby will have to be born now. My wife had to go through the pain and agony of something that would normally yield a bouncing baby, balloons and congratulations...only to go home with a fetal death certificate and a small white box with a foot print and tiny blue colored clothing. No one understood what we went through.  Twelve months later, we found out we were pregnant again with another boy. We prayed for an uneventful pregnancy and birth. What we got at 25 weeks, was my wife calling me while I was away at training and telling me that I needed to come home because it had happened again. I know that we are not the only people that have gone through this, but at the time, you feel all alone. Even surrounded by family and friend to console you, the world feels empty. To walk away from the maternity ward for the second time in two years with empty arms is devastating. If I can offer any advice at all, it&#39;s to be each other&#39;s advocates. Each other&#39;s rock. And to forgive. To forgive the people who say what they shouldn&#39;t, because they don&#39;t know what to say. Forgive your god. Forgive each other.</p>

            <p>For a long time, I missed my old life and my old self almost as much as I missed my daughter Eliza. I felt like my identity had been completely subsumed by grief.</p>

<p>I still miss my daughter more than words can say. But my old life? My old self? No longer so important. The person I am now, a mother, wife, daughter, friend, the way I fill these roles on my best days is a testament to her. There is no adequate compensation for the loss of a child. But to ignore what she taught me about unconditional love is to dishonor the significance of her life. </p>

<p>I used to believe that her death was the fork in my life, and that my life would be irrecoverably ruined after her loss.</p>

<p>It&#39;s true that everything changed when she died, but great beauty has come from these ruins. </p>

<p>I was happier before Eliza died only in the sense of being without sadness. Now I am both heartbroken and joyful; I am a mother who has given birth to death and to life. With those who have had a similar experience, I hold a sacred bond. In a world where we think tragedy happens to other people, where we turn off the news when it gets too overwhelming, I hold a grief in my heart that makes me more human, more compassionate, more furious with the injustices, and more grateful for good fortune.</p>

<p>I landed on the slim side of statistics with Eliza. I am acutely aware that there is nothing that protects me or my family from landing there again. This understanding -- of how fragile, fleeting, and unpredictable life is -- is my burden and my gift. I would trade it for nothing, except Eliza. I love her and miss her, and always will.</p>

              <q>I knew wallowing in anger would only hurt me and no one else.</q>

          <div class="text">
            <p>Our son, Micah, died at 35 weeks. Even now I&#39;m deeply saddened by the loss and I know that feeling will never go away. It took a solid year to incorporate his death into my life and I’m still incorporating. The majority of my friends disappeared after Micah died. In retrospect, I know it was because they didn&#39;t know what to do but at the time it was devastating to lose friends as well. If you know someone who has had a miscarriage or stillbirth reach out to them, call, email, just say hello, that is all you have to do. I also appreciated when friends would text on the anniversary of Micah&#39;s death.  </p>

<p>I learned a great deal from Micah&#39;s death. After a year I decided to let go of all the hurt I felt from being abandoned by my friends. I knew wallowing in anger would only hurt me and no one else. I’m also more likely to excuse bad behavior from others because I don’t know what they’re going through. I try to be more understanding and allow people to be who they are rather than what I want them to be. I was very much a person that wanted people to get over hurts and insults quickly, and now I give them a little bit more space to do that.  </p>

<p>I think if you can take this awful experience of stillbirth and ask yourself what can I learn from this you will be able to heal a large part of your heart. It doesn&#39;t make the loss of a child worth it but to remain angry and resentful isn&#39;t what most of us want our child&#39;s legacy to be.</p>

            <p>Perfect. He&#39;s perfect, the pregnancy is perfect, you&#39;re doing everything perfectly. These are the words I heard at my last OB appointment, just days before I learned my son&#39;s heart had stopped beating.  How could everything have changed so drastically? Why could no one explain what had happened?</p>

<p>Graham was a beautiful boy. He was big, he was strong.  &quot;He&#39;s an acrobat!&quot; they exclaimed at his 20-week ultrasound. We took video of him manipulating my belly with his feet.</p>

<p>I called my mom the night I couldn&#39;t feel him moving. She encouraged me to call my doctor. They sent me to the hospital. The whole drive there I kept thinking, &quot;Just kick, make me feel stupid for panicking.&quot; </p>

<p>My husband, Jon, was supportive and positive, but I could see the fear in his eyes.</p>

<p>They couldn&#39;t find a heartbeat. The poor young resident had to tell me. I think that was his first time delivering such horrible news.</p>

<p>I called my mom and had to leave a voicemail.  I didn&#39;t want to go through labor. I had my husband ask if they could just knock me out and do a C-section. I&#39;m glad now they said no, but at the time I was in agony. I couldn&#39;t stop crying. How could they expect me to have the strength?</p>

<p>Graham was small, and delicate, but still beautiful. </p>

<p>The nurses who were with me were amazing. Anyone who stuck with me through the pain deserves a medal. I am closer than ever with my family. My husband and I share a bond through Graham we never would have had otherwise. And, if anyone asks, my 2 year old, Teddy, has a big brother.</p>

            <p>When life can get so, so rough, we sometimes just need others to be kind to us. I hope that I always remember what Rowan has taught me about kindness. I can&#39;t even express how much it has meant to us that people have written us notes, came and visited us, and shown that they care. We have truly seen the goodness that people have within them. Rowan has not only changed our lives for the better, but others as well.</p>

<p>Often times people worry about what to say to those who have had tragedy invade their lives. They fear saying something wrong. From one who has been there and known others who have too, all you need to say is, &quot;I&#39;m so sorry for your loss.&quot; The worst thing to say? Nothing. When others have ignored the fact that Rowan died it is very hurtful. Sometimes it may be hard to tell them face to face. Send a letter or card if it&#39;s hard for you to express your feelings to someone who is hurting. Your kind words will bring a little bit of light to someone who is going through so much darkness. You don&#39;t have to say much. Many times I just wanted someone to listen and let me cry.</p>

<p>Something else I&#39;ve learned is that people who have had someone die will want to talk about that person at some point in time. It may seem awkward to you when they start talking about their loved one, but I assure you that it is not awkward in any way for them. Remembering those who have died is important. I know when I talk about Rowan and the change she brought into my life I am so grateful and happy to be her mother.</p>

          <div class="text">
            <p>In the hospital, spend as much time as you can with your baby. We were lucky to have a nurse that encouraged us to hold Madison and a photographer from Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep to take photos. My biggest regret is that I did not undress her and look at her whole body - I only saw her face. Consider an autopsy as it may provide answers. If cost is a concern, there are nonprofits that provide funding. </p>

<p>There is so much grief because there is so much love.</p>

<p>Feeling guilty is a natural part of grief, but that doesn&#39;t mean you are guilty.</p>

<p>Don’t feel rushed to return to normal life. If going back to work is helpful, then go back to work. If it’s too much, find out what your options are - short term disability, bereavement, etc.</p>

<p>Protect yourself. The world will move on, even though you are at a standstill. Decline the baby shower invitation. Avoid TV shows, movies and books with pregnancy storylines. </p>

<p>Your partner will grieve differently than you. Keep the lines of communication open. Lean on each other.</p>

<p>Many find talking to a therapist helpful - seek out a therapist with experience in grief and/or prenatal loss.</p>

<p>Support groups are also helpful to connect with others who have survived stillbirth or the loss of a child. </p>

<p>Go online or seek out others’ stories in print such as &quot;Three Minus One,&quot; &quot;Glow in the Woods,&quot; &quot;By the Brooke,&quot; &quot;Faces of Loss.&quot; </p>

<p>We need more research in this area. While we can&#39;t prevent all stillbirths, we can prevent some. Kick counts and third trimester ultrasounds are a place to start. Greater support and awareness for pregnancy loss at all stages may help increase support for stillbirths. </p>

<p>In memory of Madison Gupta, thank you for increasing stillbirth awareness.</p>

            <p>The ultrasound tech’s face tells us what we feared.</p>

<p>We didn’t know he was a boy, but as we hover together, alone in an office, my husband and I start to call him Michael.</p>

<p>Friends and family gather, circling us. We share the Eucharist, food for the journey — both his and ours.  </p>

<p>A nurse, whose eyes are blue and green, holds my hands and promises to help me give birth to my son.</p>

<p>He is so beautiful. Red-headed and strong.  No one can tell us why he died.</p>

<p>My dad holds my son in a corner, whispering a grandpa’s secrets to his grandson.</p>

<p>My sisters arrive in the night, and we take turns cradling him.</p>

<p>In the morning light my husband says that he is returning to the earth. Yes, the earth is gracious enough to hold this beloved body. </p>

<p>A nurse who spent the night caring for us takes Michael’s body away. Autopsy, morgue, funeral, burial.</p>

<p>People circle around us. We tell stories.  A cousin comes to visit. We talk about his brother who died in infancy. We talk about another cousin, who was also born still. And Grandma had a sister who died this way. There was another cousin, too, in our mothers’ generation, who died when she was tiny. We are not alone. I keep a list of those dear to me who have buried a child. It’s a long list.</p>

<p>I have three sons, two on earth and one in heaven. Some turn away at these words, but many tell me a story of a child who has died. Stories continue. I watch children Michael’s age for signs of him. I ache, and I pray for children and for those with aching empty arms.</p>

          <div class="text">
            <p>I lost my daughter, Joscelyn Veronica, at 26 weeks and five days. Although there was no cause of her demise determined, I blamed myself, partly because I&#39;m a pediatrician and felt that I should have known to seek attention when I felt her kick less the couple of days before our scheduled ultrasound. But I also blamed myself because I had taken a long time to truly get excited about this pregnancy. I was convinced that I somehow brought this devastating heartbreak upon myself.</p>

<p>What I&#39;ve learned over these last few months, however, is that it does a disservice to everyone involved to place blame on myself. It does nothing but cause anxiety to obsess over the what ifs. So now I try to focus on being a better mother and to carry on my daughter&#39;s legacy.</p>

<p>Please know this is not your fault. This in no way was in your control. After the darkness has faded, try to find your light again and get to know the new you, the changed you and honor those lessons learned.</p>

<p>I will no longer take things for granted and I will do my best to let my loved ones know just how much I love them. Most importantly I will never forget my first daughter, gone too soon. I thank you, Joscelyn, for making me a mother and for shaping me into the person I am today, flaws and all.</p>

            <p>Don&#39;t forget to breathe. Don&#39;t forget to cherish every moment with your baby. Even in the darkness, find light. I was so scared to deliver my daughter, I had no idea what a 28-week-old baby would look like. I was horrified at the thought of someone taking pictures of her, but then I saw her and held her and I was so in love. I cherished the four hours I spent rocking her before the funeral home took her away and I am thankful for the pictures we have with her. I would also give advice to not keep quiet, be vocal about your grief and feelings. As a military spouse we were alone in a lot of our journey after stillbirth and the Army was not very compassionate. I have made it a goal to help break the silence and help military families dealing with loss, so they do not have to walk this path alone. Sometimes we forget that soldiers have feelings too and it&#39;s O.K. for them to grieve. I am thankful for everyone that continues to shed light on this topic. These babies mattered and they were here even if they never lived outside their mothers&#39; wombs.</p>

              <q>Finding peace with this seeming impossibility required my brain and soul to stretch wider than I ever knew I could.</q>
            
          </div>
          <div class="text">
            <p>Giving birth to death forces you to come to psychological terms with the fullness of life and hold, in one singular moment, the diversity and complexity of the human experience. Finding peace with this seeming impossibility required my brain and soul to stretch wider than I ever knew I could. Although the experience is horrific, it is holy.</p>

<p>Still, it&#39;s an experience I would never wish on my worst enemy. It is literally a living nightmare. I remember waking in terror at night after leaving the hospital, only to realize my reality was worse than the dream. I would then scream with agony from heartbreak I had never experienced or knew possible. Yet, to this day, delivering and holding my son is the sweetest, most treasured moment of my life.  </p>

<p>If you are heartbreakingly joining this “club no one wants to be a member of,” know that your experience is just as valid as giving birth to a live baby -- just as meaningful and just as important. In the silence surrounding stillbirth, it’s easy to fall into isolation and shame that “my body failed me, failed my family, and failed my sweet dear child”-- and that what happened to you wasn’t a “real” birth. This couldn’t be further from the truth. For unfair reasons you had to endure a pain society would rather turn its head from. The idea of a stillbirth makes people uncomfortable, they don’t know how to be with you, what to say, or how to talk about it.  I wish this wasn’t the case, because when the nurse put my son, Ari, in my arms and I looked down at him and his little Norwegian ski-jump nose, I’ve never felt more love or pride – and I’d like to share that.</p>

          <div class="text">
            <p>I was 37 weeks into my pregnancy when one night I realized I hadn’t felt my baby move all day. After calling my midwife, I tried not to worry when she suggested I go to the hospital. There the nurses performed three ultrasounds before a doctor finally came in and told me they couldn’t find a heartbeat, my baby had died. My labor was induced and 8 hours later I delivered my baby into a room of silence. My husband watched as the midwife unraveled the umbilical cord which had wrapped tightly around his neck. They handed him to us and we held him and kissed him and told him how much we loved him. We named him, Lucas Russell James. </p>

<p>That was the easiest part. Maybe because I was in shock or maybe because I was so focused on the decisions that had to be made and thinking about the next steps. It wasn’t until days later, after the funeral that the loss truly hit me. I felt like I was drowning. I longed to hold my son, I ached for him. I felt like the pain I was feeling would last forever. I was grieving for him, but also for me and the happy life I thought was gone. </p>

<p>But time passed and life continued. And now, five months later I still miss my beautiful Lucas and think about him every day, but I can also smile, and I can laugh. And there are times I can think about my son and not just feel loss and sadness, but an overwhelming sense of love and peace.   </p>

<p>For anyone who has recently experienced this type of loss, please know two things: The pain will not last forever. You are stronger than you could ever had imagined. </p>

              <q>I remarried and an unplanned pregnancy forced me to finally grieve, heal and find confidence in myself.</q>
            
          </div>
          <div class="text">
            <p>I became very ill during my pregnancy and lost my little girl. While it was never confirmed, the doctors told me that I it was likely due to listeria. I was in intensive care following the delivery of the baby, and I vividly remember my in-laws asking me what I had eaten and why I had been working so hard while pregnant. I had trouble speaking because of the breathing mask, and was too weak to sit up -- there was no way to escape their blame. Grief can make people cruel.</p>

<p>For years I believed that I had mistakenly survived. I was terrified to &quot;try again&quot; for another child and wanted no part of the crushing responsibility of motherhood. I divorced and moved to the other side of the world, never mentioning my experience to anyone. I remarried and an unplanned pregnancy forced me to finally grieve, heal and find confidence in myself. I now have a wonderful little boy. I do my best for him. I have accepted that I will be accountable for his temper tantrums and fevers. </p>

<p>I suffered so much from the words and actions of others following the stillbirth. I want to tell other women to look for love and support, and never regret being alive. My experience changed me forever, forcing me to find an internal source of courage and love.</p>

            <p>Talk about it. Write about it. Be sad. Be hurt. It&#39;s okay to feel mistreated by life. Don&#39;t feel guilty for those scarce moments of peace that ebb in and out of your days. Don&#39;t feel guilty if you&#39;re not at peace. Get help if you need it. Read other people&#39;s stories. Write your own story. I&#39;m a writer, so I knew that writing would be my outlet, which is why shortly after losing my son at 33 weeks gestation to causes unknown, I created the site Letters to Jude where I post at least once a month and where I invite others with often silent losses --miscarriages and stillbirths -- to share their stories. The first thing I wrote for Jude was an explanation of how we named him and what his name means to us; I read it at his funeral. I also wrote his obituary. Having a funeral to celebrate the life that should have been was both painful and therapeutic for me. I kept saying that I&#39;ll never get to have a birthday party for him or see him fall in love or hear him laugh or comfort his cry...I want to do this for him. Having a funeral allowed other people to get to know our baby and to let his life resonate with others. By doing that, I feel he has life...if our love for him has moved others, then he lives in them. These are things that help me cope. We&#39;ll never have closure over losing Jude, and that&#39;s okay. I would rather feel and let him teach me to be a better person for it.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="text">
            <p>I had a stillbirth almost 14 years back.  Here is a what I have to say:</p>

<p>There is a Sanskrit saying “Putra shokam nirantaram,” which means “grief due to the loss of one’s child stays forever.” This grief will always stay with me; only difference is over the years I have learned to handle it and learned so much from it. Time is the best healer.</p>

<p>Here is how I would summarize: If you have faced the loss of a child, please do not lose hope. Though it is very hard, trust in the saying “Everything happens for a reason.” Take your time to bounce back no matter what others say. There may be a lot of unwanted, insensitive advice coming your way from known and unknown sources. Take in only what comforts you. Disregard the rest. Do not bear grudges against anyone. Trust that people are only trying to help you in the way they know best. Banish guilt. You can either become bitter or better. I have chosen to become better. If you are a believer, trust in Him. </p>

<p>It is said “Life’s best lessons are always learned under tough situations.” This incident has taught me so much about life and so much more about myself. Having been through the experience, I have now emerged stronger, yet gentler, a little skeptical at every new step but a lot more hopeful and bold enough to face the curveballs life throws at us every now and then. I sincerely thank my wonderful family for being extremely supportive through all these ups and downs.  </p>

<p>After 14 long years, my mind has truly stabilized. This incident now seems like another page in my life&#39;s diary: one that is very close to my heart. I have healed.</p>

            <p>June 9, 1985, what a beautiful day for a birth. Nine had always been my favorite number! I woke up with a sharp pain in my abdomen. I didn&#39;t know I was hemorrhaging internally. My husband rushed me to the hospital. I was reluctant to go. I thought I was just in early labor. At the hospital, I heard the dreaded news from a nurse: There was no heartbeat. I wanted my mother. Now the pain in my abdomen was excruciating. They performed an emergency C-section. My husband encouraged me to see the baby. I kissed the side of his little head. I named him Anthony, after my father. No one could help me with the pain of losing him. I was all alone. Have another baby, people said. But, I wasn&#39;t done grieving for my Anthony. I became pregnant five months after losing my baby. I was so depressed. I didn&#39;t understand how I could be. I was supposed to be happy. Elisabeth was born five weeks early. When we took her home two weeks later I was despondent. I couldn&#39;t bond with her. Thank God she received the love and care from my family that she deserved and needed. I felt such guilt. I was depressed for another year. I thought I would never be happy and whole again. Where was Theresa! I was lost. Gradually, I started to become involved with Elisabeth. I hugged and kissed her. I bought her pretty clothes. I was falling in love with my beautiful little girl! I never thought I&#39;d be happy again. Elisabeth brought me back to life. I always tell her that there was a reason Anthony was born. I truly believe that he somehow gave me the strength to try again. He had given me the wonderful gift of Elisabeth. I will always remember his little face. My sweet Anthony.</p>

            <p>The grief is real. You will not be able to move forward unless you allow yourself to feel this grief. Stillbirth is one of those tragedies that people cannot truly empathize with unless they have experienced something similar themselves. When my first child was stillborn in 1998, I did not have a &quot;real life&quot; support group to help me deal with my pain. Although well-meaning, my friends and family&#39;s misguided silence about what I had just experienced drove me into a deeper depression. I found an online support group (Share Atlanta) that published a monthly newsletter with stories, letters and poems written by other bereaved parents. There was also a pen pal section for parents to connect with one another. Here I connected with someone who was also my age (17 years old) and had experienced a loss a few months earlier. This connection allowed me to heal. To have someone that I could share the ups and downs of bereavement, without judgement, was central to my healing process. At times my depression went into such depths that I truly believe that I would not have made it without these connections that I made with other bereaved parents.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="text">
            <p>I wish to tell parents of stillborn angels that, no matter what anyone says (your &quot;well meaning&quot; family members, society, etc.) you are still a parent, and you will always be. That is a gift, a love that no one can ever take from you. The grief you feel is overwhelming, but remember that for a moment (no matter how fleeting) you knew the joy of giving birth to your baby, that you got to hold him or her, to see how beautiful they were, who they looked like the most. You will always have that love in your heart.</p>

<p>Also, be gentle on yourselves, with your grieving. You have been through a life changing experience -- the momentous joy of a child’s birth, and the raw, open wound of your baby’s death. Don’t feel that you have to grieve “on schedule,” and that you should be “done” with your grief after a certain number of months or years. Don’t let the “well-meant” rush you, scold you, or ask questions like “You’re STILL not over it?” Your child was a life. Your child was REAL. You don’t just heal from death as if it was a bad cut, or a bad case of stomach flu. Let yourself feel your emotions -- your love, your sadness, your anger, your rage. There will be times (especially in the first days) where you can’t even think about getting out of bed. When my son passed away, the days without him dragged on. My life -- the life I had prepared with a child to see grow up, the life we would share -- seemed instead feels like a life sentence. I can never say it gets easier, but you take the days after your child’s death one day at a time.</p>

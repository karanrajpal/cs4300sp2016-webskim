Though it later became clear that he was not the first Cuban infected, he was in the first group tested, and became Patient No. 1 in the national records. She was infected in the brief time they had together between his return and the test results coming back.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="351" data-total-count="10332">While she is serious, her husband was a practical joker, a buddy to everyone. He was first quarantined in a naval hospital with other soldiers, and used to describe how stir-crazy they went, smuggling in rum and once breaking out on a bedsheet rope. That April, Cuba opened its first sanitarium, and Maria and Reynaldo were the first couple admitted.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="214" data-total-count="10546">“Soldiers guarded us, and I didn’t see my son again until November, and then it was with a chaperon,” she said. “He was 9, and I had to accept seeing him once a week. I lost the nicest years of his life.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="234" data-total-count="10780">Still, they had a cottage, and life inside was comfortable. Her husband became the compound’s carpenter and electrician. She formed the first patient group.

I had to share rooms, and a table, with these people. It was very, very hard. But I learned to love others for who they were.”</p><figure id="media-100000001532923" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000001532923 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/05/08/health/08cubaprofiles-lenia/08cubaprofiles-lenia-jumbo.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">

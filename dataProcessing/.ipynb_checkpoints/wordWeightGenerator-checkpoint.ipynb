It speck pierc the sky at about 148,000 mile per hour .If you blink , your not go to see them . They move that fast ,  said Bill Cook , an astronom with NASA Meteoroid Environ Offic . The meteor , which are often no bigger than a grain of sand , can pack a punch equival to a .357-calib bullet , accord to Dr. Cook . That whi they leav these brilliant streak in the atmospher  they have a lot of energy.The show favor the Southern Hemispher over the Northern Hemispher . Stargaz south of the Equat will see between 20 and 30 meteor per hour dure the peak , while those to the north will catch about half as mani . But even if your in the Northern Hemispher , the Eta Aquarid should provid a better perform than last month Lyrid meteor shower , which wa washed-out by the moon .Your next chanc to wit remnant from Halley comet rain on Earth will be in Octob dure the Orionid shower . Sinc the celesti celebr pay us a visit onli about everi 76 year , Dr. Cook suggest take advantag of the annual shower , especi if you dont want to wait until 2061 .The Eta Aquarid and Orionid shower provid an opportun to at least see part of Halley comet burn up ,  Dr. Cook said .', 'A gel use to prevent infect in the umbil cord stump of newborn wa endors by the European Medicin Agenc last week , an import step toward distribut of the disinfect in poor countri .Infect of the stump , after it is cut and clamp or tie , kill mani newborn .

The compani will not patent the design and will help small manufactur in poor countri make their own version , Dr. William said .In 2011 , the World Health Organ releas a list of 30 basic , inexpens drug or item that everi clinic in the world should have to save mothers and children live . Chlorhexidin disinfect wa on the list , along with antibiot , intraven salin , zinc , oral rehydr solut and other simpl intervent .In 2010 , an American studi of hospit infect found that wash the skin with a chlorhexidine-alcohol solut befor surgeri result in far fewer postop infect than the povidone-iodin solut that most hospit use .', 'What craft these crisscross line in the Caspian Sea ?It a question that had Norman Kure scratch hi head earlier thi month when he first saw thi satellit imag of the shallow water surround the Tyuleniy Archipelago .Mr. Kure , an oceanograph for NASA , often examin imag taken by the agency Landsat 8 satellit , which orbit some 440 mile abov Earth . But he had never befor seen what look like underwat scar stretch for mile across the green and blue seafloor .I had no idea what they were ,  he said . I thought mayb they were mark of trawler which sometim disturb the bottom.He and hi colleagu post the peculiar pictur to Twitter and ask for help .Other were also befuddl . Some suggest it might be mark left by a motorboat propel . But after a few tweet they found a more like suspect : ice .The ice in the northern part of the Caspian Sea is thin , onli about a foot and a half , but the water by the island is also shallow , about 10 feet deep .The theori wa that larg , frozen chunk had been blown across the sea until they pile on top of each other , like ice cube in a pitcher . The stack ice might have been deep enough to goug the seafloor . As the wind blew , the ice wa drag across the bottom , plow the sea grass and alga .With hi new hunch , Mr. Kure turn back to the Landsat 8 imag and rewound them to Januari when winter still grasp the region . The photo show that the area wa cover in ice at the exact spot where the mark were found .It wa even clearer at that point that most of the mark were caus by ice blown around by the wind ,  Mr. Kure said . It like a big rake across the bottom.Mr. Kure and hi colleagues suspicion wa confirm by Stanislav Ogorodov a research at Lomonosov Moscow State Univers who had previous observ the sea scar , known as scour mark . Accord to NASA , after Dr. Ogorodov look at the imag , he said the scratch were undoubtedly ice scour mark , melt away the mysteri .', 'In the murki depth of Panama Pacif coast , marin biologist wit what look like a scene from The Walk Dead : Thousand of crab march like a zombi hord .The team stumbl upon the horror movi moment last April while explor the aptli name Hannib Bank Seamount , an underwat mountain home to a plethora of sea life .At first they examin sea urchin , spong and black coral from their submarin .

But , Mr. Drori said , Mr. Doumbouya wa eventu caught with export permit , which he should not have possess becaus by that time he had left hi offici posit . Mr. Drori said that he , Ms. Houplin and other first investig anoth suspect dealer whom they use to get more inform on Mr. Doumbouya . That suspect , Thierno Barri , wa also arrest .Mr. Drori say Eagl is the world first nongovernment enforc organ and doe everyth it can to fight corrupt . The organ conduct undercov work and research to develop evid to support prosecut , and act as a watchdog as case move through the court . But Eagl can not actual make arrest ; it cooper with nation and intern polic .In the case of Mr. Doumbouya , both Interpol and Guinean law enforc author were involv .Mr. Drori came to the unusu role of nonprofit law enforc after work as a journalist in Africa write about wildlif issu . He wa frustrat and angri by the level of corrupt , he said , and the way that enforc wa hamper by briberi at everi step . A lot of it is a sham ,  he ad .

Now , we have more than 1,000 success arrests in sever countri , he said .Mr. Drori sign hi email with a quotat often attribut to Abraham Lincoln : A law without enforc is realli just good advice.Wildlif traffick in Guinea ha been rampant , accord to sever agenc . A report from Grasp in 2013 on the illeg trade in ape cite 643 document case of chimpanze illeg smuggl out of Africa , each a captur from the wild , between 2005 and 2011 , mostli go to zoo in China .The report said thi wa onli a fraction of the chimpanze captur in Guinea by poacher , sinc mani die while be captur or transport , or are never document . The report claim the real number of chimp and other ape caught illeg in the wild wa more than 20 time higher , close to 3,000 per year . Now , Mr. Cress say , about two great ape are seiz from smuggler each week by enforc offici . In 2013 , the Convent on Intern Trade in Endang Speci sanction Guinea , prohibit ani trade in thousand of speci , includ parrot .Under the Guinean crimin system , similar to the French system , Mr. Doumbouya is be held while hi case is further investig , which could take month .Hi lawyer , Mori Doumbouya , said he wa prohibit from comment on a case that wa under investig .Mr. Cress said that if Ansouman Doumbouya is convict of wildlif traffick , he could face sever year in prison .', 'SAN FRANCISCO  Californian sharpli cut water use thi summer , prompt state offici to credit their new conserv polici and the sting of thousand of warn and penalti that they had issu to peopl for overus .But the most effect enforc may be closer to home : the domest water polic .They are the mom and dad , spous and partner , children , even co-work and neighbor who are quick to wag a finger when they spot peopl squander moistur , such as a faucet left run while theyr brush their teeth , or use too much water to clean dinner plate in the sink . And shower ? No linger allow .So discov Dick Allen , a retir businessman in San Francisco , who tell of get bust recent by hi wife . Hed just step into a hot shower to loosen up after a workout when she appear in the bathroom to scold him . Youv been in the shower too long ,   he recal her say . How do you know that ?  he plead . She had proof  hi back wa red . It wa the gotcha moment ,  said Mr. Allen , who occasion joke with hi younger wife that she ha junior water rights and therefor cant shower until the follow day .The cultur of badger ha intensifi sinc Januari 2014 , when the drought led Gov . Jerri Brown to declar a state of emerg and ask Californian to voluntarili cut water use by 20 percent . But as condit worsen , the state stop ask so polit . In June and Juli , for instanc , state water agenc issu more than 70,000 warn for overus and more than 20,000 penalti . ( The fine vari wide , but were gener sever hundr dollar or less , state offici said . )Mani of the warn were issu becaus someone neighbor rat on them ,  said Max Gomberg , climat and conserv manag for the State Water Resourc Control Board . The actual penalti , he said , were assess to a tini percentag of peopl who just dont care.The nanny-st strategi , howev , ha been help by the nagging-st approach at home , accord to interview with peopl across the state . By mani account , the needl often seem taken in it intend , well-mean spirit . But it isnt alway welcom , particularli when it come from someon outsid the inner famili circl .That led to an awkward moment for J. S. Gilbert and hi wife recent dure a gather at their hous with friend in South San Francisco . One of the visitor use the bathroom and , Mr. Gilbert happen to notic , didnt flush . So he mention thi oversight to hi friend , who look me straight in the eye and said , If it yellow , let it mellow ,   said Mr. Gilbert , who work as a consult to advertis agenc .I said , I think that O.K . if that you and your wife at home ,   Mr. Gilbert respond , which invit anoth ripost from hi visitor . He said : That up to you . Im do what I can to save water. Water shame ha plenti of precursor . Public safeti advoc , for instanc , have said that greater use of seatbelt , and a drop in drunken drive episod nationwid , can be trace in part to friend and famili member give offend a mouth .With water , the California drought in the late 1970 and 80 prompt some homegrown polic , but noth like the crackdown now take place in household across the state , said Jeffrey Mount , a senior fellow of the Public Polici Institut of California . ( A poll from the group publish in March found that , for the first time , Californians concern about the drought equal concern about job and the economi ) .Shorter shower and fewer toilet flush can add up , but they repres a small fraction of the water be use for lawn irrig and agricultur , said Jeffrey Michael , an economist who studi water issu at the Univers of the Pacif in California . Resid and urban district are typic respons for about 20 percent of the state water usag ; the rest is use for agricultur , which is not includ in the state latest water-sav figur .But Dr. Michael said Californians willing to nudg one anoth could chang the collect mind-set toward water .In Dr. Michael own household , outsid Sacramento , the water cop duti are divid . He handl the lawn , while hi wife overse the shower . But Dr. Michael said the differ role betray a subtext in water polic : Peopl use the drought to press their own agenda .For instanc , he like cut back on water partli becaus he hate lawn care . And he think hi wife is tough on shower time becaus she would realli like famili member to be more effici in all thing . She want peopl to get readi faster ,  he said , ad , You can use the drought to sort of hasten or further our altern goals.Some Californian polic colleagu at work to , say , toss a half-drunk cup of water on a plant and not down the drain . Some resid hear it from their children ; Robin Wolan , an execut at a nonprofit in San Francisco , got an ear from her teenag daughter becaus she wa shave her leg in the shower with the water run . Shave without run water ? Uncivil ,  Ms. Wolan said in an interview . But she found littl support from friend on Facebook , so she now shave with the tap off .Other are weigh how appropri it is to nag a neighbor . For instanc , Nick Desai , the chief execut of a health care start-up and a resid of Pacif Palisad , said he had been think of a proper way to tell hi new neighbor that they should revisit their sprinkler strategi .I think Ill wait anoth two week and Ill knock on the door and say , At night I can see the sprinkler from our bedroom , and theyr mostli water the patio ,   he said .Mani peopl report that polic pit gener against each other . Parent , especi , say they can have troubl get through to smaller children who think of water as just plain fun . And how exactli to counter year of program that children need to bath everi night ?The pendulum ha swung from filthi boy need a bath twice a day to , Doe he realli need a bath ?   said Dave Donohu , a San Franciscan who ha reduc bath for hi son Milo , 2 , and also conced chide hi wife and hi colleagu if they toss a glass of drink water into the sink .The habit ha caught on elsewher . Tara Lindi , a writer in Brooklyn , said she had use California dri spell as a teach moment for her children . For exampl , when they were have a water fight in the backyard thi summer , she said she told them , Dont dump that bucket ! Kid in California cant have water balloon fight like you ! They dont get bath ! What goe around come around . The other day , her son , who is almost 7 , admonish her : That wa a long shower.Sometim you just cant win with the water cop . Mr. Gilbert , the ad agenc consult in South San Francisco , wa told by anoth friend ( not the one who declin to flush at hi parti ) that he need to replac the old toilet in hi hous becaus it use too much water .Eventu , after be hector for a few month , he relent and replac the toilet . Unfortun , the new low-flow toilet , which wa white , no longer match the old green sink and tub . So Mr. Gilbert replac the sink , and enamel the tub himself , spend $ 2,500 for the new fixtur and plumb , plu hi own enamel time .The next time the friend came over , Mr. Gilbert show off hi effort . I said , Are you happi I replac the toilet ?  and he said , Well , at thi point , Im not sure we have to worri so much , wer go to have El Nio.

The inequ that shape our live from birth onward doesnt end with the first Social Secur check.Socioeconom inequ , he note , help determin who get to grow old .Dr. Abramson book The End Game : How Inequ Shape Our Final Year ,  and a report from the Nation Academi of Scienc last month on the grow life expect gap , underscor the effect of incom and educ on old age .Ronald Lee , a demograph at the Univers of California , Berkeley , and a co-chairman of the committe that studi the gap , told me he wa stagger by it find .Divid the popul into lifetim earn level , the committe found that men born in 1930 who reach age 50 had a life expect of anoth 26.6 year if they were in the lowest incom bracket and 31.7 year in the highest bracket . But project for men born in 1960 show no improv for the lowest earner  and an addit seven year for the highest . In three decad , the life expect gap had widen from about five year to more than 12  shockingli larg ,  Dr. Lee said .The longev gain wev all heard ( and written ) so much about , in other word , are go to the men atop the econom ladder .And , even more strikingli , to the women at the top . Lower-earn women actual have declin life expect in simul that compar the 1960 cohort with those born in 1930 . That larg explain by differ in start and quit smoke ,  Dr. Lee said . But those in the top earn bracket who reach 50 can now expect , on averag , anoth 41.9 year . The gap by incom ha surg from four year to more than 13 .Those widen gap mean that the rich get richer when it come to feder benefit  Social Secur , Medicar and Medicaid .

In poor neighborhood , it look much like the stereotyp of hous project ,  Dr. Abramson said . The physic environ , everyth from sidewalk to hous , tend to be more poorli maintained. Higher crime rate made age adult fear about ventur out .Health care vari , too . The fact that virtual all older American reli on Medicar or Medicaid , or both , hardli eras the cumul effect of a lifetim of unequ access .Carol Rosen ha never lack health insur , for exampl , and buy supplement insur to cover much of what Medicar doesnt . Susan McNeeli cant afford the premium for a Medigap polici . After spend a week in the hospit with worsen emphysema last spring , she still sporadically pay noncov medic bill . She skimp on dental care , too , becaus Medicar doesnt cover it .Inequ affect even the benefit of social network .

Thi is part of a fledg effort to address problem that had been virtual forgotten for mani year ,  said Dr. Vikram Patel , a psychiatrist , professor of intern mental health and co-found of a community-bas mental health center , Sangath , in Goa State , India .Sinc 2007 , when a landmark seri in the medic journal The Lancet help put the issu on the map , public health research at Harvard have project that the overal cost burden of mental disord will soon outstrip that of all other categori of noncommunic ill , includ heart diseas and cancer . By one analysi , which includ Western countri and develop region like West Africa , depress , drug abus and schizophrenia are on track to be the three lead caus of lost econom output by 2030 .Intern aid agenc have taken note and are fund a hand of rigor trial of low-cost program to treat sever , chronic mental disord . The juri is still mostli out . There incred littl research on intervent for the sever ill and thi belief that the develop of commun servic will take care of everyth ,  said Dr. Alex Cohen , the cours director of the global mental health program at the London School of Hygien & Tropic Medicin .Research hope the community-bas support that have been effect in reduc disabl from blind and other physic afflict will also help peopl with mental ill .Sever studi have produc encourag result by deploy health worker who are not doctor to treat peopl who have had trauma and depress . Among the success have been group therapi for rape victim in the Democrat Republ of Congo , famili and individu counsel for survivor of tortur in Myanmar , and talk therapi and medic for peopl with depress in rural India .We can make such a great differ for these famili precis becaus the need is so great ,  said Dr. Oye Gurej , a professor of psychiatri at the Univers of Ibadan in Nigeria .But without reliabl support , follow-up and medic suppli  particularli psychiatr drug when need  intervent can quickli lose traction , no matter how well train and devot the worker are .The War Memori Hospit in Navrongo , Ghana , for exampl , ha had no stock of schizophrenia drug sinc the begin of the year , and the number of follow-up visit from patient drop by half in the first quarter of 2015 from the same period in 2014 .If we dont have the medic , they stop come ,  said Frederick Adiak , a regist psychiatr nurs there . They quickli lose faith in medic treatment entirely.She want to be a teacher .Her grade were good ; her English wa excel ; she wa from a larg , establish famili with properti and anim . At 17 , Ms. Ajadogbil could see a clear path from complet high school , through teacher train , to a salari , a class of her own and some independ .The vision that displac that aspir came unannounc one afternoon in school 12 year ago . One moment , she wa doze off dure a rest period ; the next , she felt the presenc of strang men come after her . She scream at them to stop . Mi shout didnt stop the men ; they kept come for me ,  she said . So , what did I do ? I rip off my school uniform and ran.She awok in a clinic hour later , deepli confus . The medic staff had littl train in how to handl a psychot break : the hallucin and delus characterist of schizophrenia . They sent her home , where the sensat of be hunt seep back into her thought .She wa afraid all the time , and we were afraid for her ,  her father , Ajadogbil Anyawi , said .I had to leav school , and I couldnt go back ,  Ms. Ajadogbil said .At home , she ignor everyon around her  parent , sibl , grandpar , uncl and aunt  and becam more paranoid . I got a friend Bibl and start pray so hard ,  she said . I thought there were peopl out to kill me , and I knew no one could kill God.Sometim , she ran out onto the open savanna to escap the demon pursu her . Famili member exhaust tradit method of heal . Preciou anim were sacrif to drive away the spirit disturb her . Healer administ herbal powder , and one appli a pale dye to her face and bodi in an effort to purg demon .The elder decid not to take ani more chanc with her wander . For famili with a psychot rel , the choic is between alway be on guard and confin . The famili decid she would be constrain with a wooden shackl  a heavi log with a hole bore through it and fit over her ankl .Month pass , then a year . Mental ill is a sourc of shame here , as in most of the world , and famili do not advertis it presenc . Yet each commun ha a chief or subchief respons for keep an eye out for the sick . When the Ajadogbil family subchief learn of their predica in 2004 , he call Michael Akankpienkum , a field offic for Presbyterian Community-Bas Rehabilit .I got the call about Rebecca and rode out there immedi ,  Mr. Akankpienkum said .He explain to the elder that he could get Ms. Ajadogbil medic care . Anyth that will help ,  her father said .I found her in the room there , paint with thi herbal dye , tether to a log ,  Mr. Akankpienkum recal . She wa sit on the floor . I came in and said , What is thi ?  Thi is how they protect me ,  she answer .I said : All right , Im go to bring you a doctor right now . Is that O.K . ?   Mr. Akankpienkum said .Ms. Ajadogbil assent . That day , a mental health nurs administ an inject contain a strong sed and haloperidol , a drug that blunt psychosi .Bi the time we arriv , the famili are usual exhaust ,  said Alhassan Ayanu Seinu , who is one of three mental health nurs work with Presbyterian Community-Bas Rehabilit and manag Ms. Ajadogbil case . They are readi to tri anyth , and it usual the first opportun they have to tri modern therapies.Ms. Ajadogbil soon fell into a long , deep sleep .Presbyterian strategi includ a number of element that are now subject of intens studi around the world . Each ha help reduc disabl in peopl with physic impedi , like river blind .One is known as task share . The program doctors are in fact nurs with mental health train , aid by field worker with some basic train and good villag contact .The second is commun self-help . Mr. Akandem and hi staff overse 23 patient group , with more than 1,000 member total , who meet regularli to advis one anoth and to pressur the govern for the drug or servic they need .The third is rais awar ; the organ host a popular radio program featur peopl who have recov from mental disord , who talk about their experi and what wa most help . Final , there is job train , in skill like sew , anim husbandri , farm and carpentri .The evid that a combin of these servic can lead to last improv for peopl with sever mental ill is thin , but a foundat is be laid . In a 2014 studi in The Lancet , psychiatr research in India follow 253 patient assign to receiv standard clinic care or standard care plu commun support , like regular home visit from lay health care worker and link to local group .The research track the patients symptom and qualiti of life over 12 month . Both group improv on measur of symptom sever over the cours of the year . But those who receiv the community-bas compon  particularli in the most rural site , Tamil Nadu  did slightli better than the other . They were more like to show sustain relief of symptom like suspici , withdraw and delus ; to becom more social and engag at home ; and to be work .The role of commun is particularli import for mental health intervent in remot area . A villag can effect expel a program that offend it tradit concept of mental problem , just as it can expel a disrupt person with mental ill , expert say . But that same self-protect instinct can work to support new approach if the commun buy in .A new studi , fund by the Wellcom Trust , is test thi approach for peopl with schizophrenia in Ethiopia , deliv the entir packag of intervent . The key thing is that it not simpli home-bas care for peopl with schizophrenia ,  Laura Asher , who is run the studi , said by email . It also involv awar rais and commun mobilization.Access to medic is essenti , and psychiatr drug are cheap by Western standard in place like Ethiopia : gener no more than $ 1 for a monthli suppli of gener antipsychot pill . But that almost alway come out of pocket , and mani peopl can not afford it , Dr. Asher said . Part of mobil the commun , she said , is set up inform arrang in villag in which peopl with mean contribut to help those who can not afford care .Drug suppli is perhap the largest obstacl to success . In Ghana , there are shortag almost everi year , in part becaus of delay in the govern contract process , said Humphrey Kofi , the execut secretari of the Mental Health Societi of Ghana , the country lead patient advocaci group . Thi drive up price and feed a black market for donat or subsid drug . Famili , discourag , fall back on tradit healer , Mr. Kofi and other said .Still , the cost of these program is minut compar with the cost of standard psychiatri . BasicNe Ghana , a mental health care program base in Tamal and similar to Mr. Akandem , spend about $ 8 per client per month on averag , accord to Peter Yaro , it execut director . In the Unit State , it cost $ 200 to $ 700 for a singl appoint with a psychiatrist .The Robert Wood Johnson Foundat ha provid $ 280,000 through the Chariti Aid Foundat of America for a trial of BasicNeeds model in underserv area of the Unit State . It part of a grow recognit that program that are realli effect in low-incom countri , we can learn from them ,  said Deborah Bae , a senior program offic at the foundat .In global cost-benefit term , economist typic rate health care program by the amount of disabl they reduc per dollar . Histor , mental health intervent have score poorli compar with effort that save young live , like neonat care or treatment of diarrhea . A new analysi of mental health strategi in Ethiopia , for instanc , found that treat schizophrenia with gener medic wa about as cost-effect as treat heart diseas with a combin of drug , like aspirin and a statin  and much less cost-effect than treat depress or epilepsi . The find , though preliminari , suggest that treat psychosi is rel costli .Yet there are two caveat in such calcul , expert said . One is that they are base on estim that includ the possibl of hospit , which is expens . The other is that the studi do not take into account the effect of chronic psychosi on a famili . The person with psychosi becom a full-tim job for someon els in the famili , and depend on how aggress the person is , mayb more than one person ,  said Dr. Simliwa Kolou Valentin Dassa , a psychiatrist in neighbor Togo .And if the disord is seen as a result of a curs on the famili , carri down through gener  a common interpret  the entir clan come under suspicion .In the end , it a human right issu ,  Mr. Kofi said . You get peopl treatment becaus it the right thing to do.The first thing Ms. Ajadogbil notic after the sed wore off wa a sens of light . The nurs had told her thi could happen . The inject contain a drug meant to dispers the threaten delus brought on by her schizophrenia . And so it had . The fear wa gone ,  she said .Anoth thing she soon notic wa the absenc of her shackl . Her ankl wa sore but free . The dye she had worn on her face and chest for so long  that wa gone , too .She came back to us ,  her father said .Ms. Ajadogbil treatment regimen , a daili dose of haloperidol , ha not been without problem . She ha good day and bad one , and need to take anoth medic to control the stiff that haloperidol caus . She also ha to scrambl to make sure she doe not run out of medic .I got a call from her just last week , late , becaus she wa nearli out and need a prescript ,  Mr. Ayanu Seinu said in an interview in April . She wa veri anxious.Yet her world , so small for so long , ha expand . She learn sew skill dure treatment . That allow her to help her mother at home , and later , she found the confid to work for pay in a nearbi villag .

Thank in part to El Nio , snowpack in the Sierra Nevada is greater than it ha been in year . With the winter snowfal season wind down , California offici said that the pack peak two week ago at 87 percent of the long-term averag .That far better than last year , when it wa just 5 percent of normal and Gov . Jerri Brown announc restrict on water use after four year of sever drought . But the drought is still far from over , especi in Southern California , where El Nio did not bring mani major storm .Despit the better news thi year , there are plenti of worri sign about the Sierra snowpack , which provid about 30 percent of the water Californian use after it melt and flow into river and reservoir , accord to the state Depart of Water Resourc .Mani of those concern stem from the effect of climat chang and the structur of Sierra forest , which can influenc how the snowpack accumul and melt . Becaus the snow , in effect , serv as a reservoir that is releas over time , ani chang can affect how much water is avail for peopl , industri and agricultur , and when .Well be get more rain and less snow here ,  said Roger C. Bale , a professor at the Univers of California , Merc , and a princip investig with the Southern Sierra Critic Zone Observatori , which studi snowpack and other water-rel issu . That mean less snowpack storag and faster runoff.Dr. Bale wa stand on a snowi slope in Yosemit last Thursday , at about 7,000 feet elev , just off a 19th-centuri wagon road that is use by hiker and snowshoer . Nearbi , amid car-siz granit boulder and close to a soar Ponderosa pine , were instrument that he and hi fellow research use to obtain detail inform about the snowpack in sever spot throughout the southern Sierra .The effect of warmer temperatur can alreadi be seen here , Dr. Bale said .Histor , thi ha been the reliabl snow zone , where it accumul till late March or earli April and then melt ,  he said . But now the snowpack here is more like that at lower elev , where it will accumul , melt , accumul , melt ,  he said .Proof wa close at hand , as well . Until the last quarter-mil of a two-mil hike here from 6,300 feet , snowsho were not need . What snow remain wa in small patch .Similar effect of climat chang have been seen throughout the Sierra , includ at the Central Sierra Snow Laboratori , which is oper by the Univers of California at Berkeley near the Donner Pass , about 120 mile to the north . Research there still make some measur the way they have sinc the lab start in the 1940 , by insert special metal tube into the snow .We are see an ever-increas percentag of annual and winter precipit in liquid rather than solid form ,  said Randal Osterhub , who spend winter at the lab . The altitud abov which snow accumul is becom higher as temperatur warm . That chang in elev mean a lot less terrain is cover in snow.Climat chang is also expect to increas precipit in some area , becaus warmer air can hold more moistur . But it is not yet clear if that will be the case in the Sierra Nevada .Snowpack is measur in snow water equival ,  or how much water would result if the snow were melt . When snow first fall in the Sierra , it is usual dri and powderi , with about 10 to 12 percent moistur by volum , but as it accumul and compress , the moistur content rise to about 40 percent . So 30 inch of snow on March 30 would be equival to about 12 inch of water .The data from Dr. Bales instrument will not be download until later in the spring , but just up the slope , other instrument set up by the Depart of Water Resourc send data continu to state offic in Sacramento . Last Thursday , they record a water equival of 18.36 inch . With warm spring temperatur , the snowpack here wa past it peak , with the water equival declin by more than three inch in less than two week .The Depart of Water Resourc instrument are set up in a rel open part of the forest . The observatory instrument , by contrast , are near the Ponderosa pine , and there are three of them : one next to the trunk , one a littl farther away where water drip from the tip of the branch , and one in the open , about 20 feet away . Other sensor , which are buri , detect how much water is in the ground .The goal is to gather a complet pictur of the snowpack , which is far from a uniform blanket of white . A tree , for exampl can affect snow cover in sever way , Dr. Bale said . Some snow is caught by the branch and turn directli to vapor . Other flake melt and the water drip to the ground . The tree trunk itself absorb sunlight and re-emit it as heat , melt the snow around it . Boulder do the same thing . Even the tiniest piec of forest litter  needl or bit of pine cone  can heat up in the sunlight and caus melt .Wer strateg sampl the landscap ,  Dr. Bale said . We pretti much know what topograph featur affect snowpack. That will give water manag a truer understand of how much water the snowpack will gener .Tree also affect the amount of water store in the mountain simpli by grow , suck up water from the ground . Some of it is use in photosynthesi , but much of it is lost through evapor and transpir through the leav and stem . Dr. Bale and hi colleagu studi thi , too , with instrument atop tower that measur the flow of water vapor from the tree canopi .The scientist learn that a lot of water wa lost through the tree  more than wa even thought to be there in some case . That told us the precipit estim that peopl had for higher elev were just plain wrong ,  Dr. Bale said .Warmer temperatur also mean that tree grow faster , and dont necessarili shut down for the winter . Thu they use more of the melt snow , and over a longer period . That leav less water to flow into stream and down to reservoir .Less snow , earlier melt and faster growth mean that more tree are run out of water in the summer . Mohammad Safeeq , a colleagu of Dr. Bale at the univers , said that , in gener , water wa flow off the mountain two week earlier than in the past . Two week in a three-month summer window is signific ,  he said .Water-stress tree are more suscept to pest and diseas , so one result of the chang is more tree death . Thi is readili appar at Yosemit in the drive from the valley floor , where the green hillsid are dot  in some case in larg number  with the brown of dead pine and fir .Contribut to the problem is the fact that there are mani more tree here than there use to be . A centuri ago , Dr. Safeeq said , Yosemit had perhap 20 tree an acr ; now the number is closer to 100 . That mean more of the melt snowpack never get off the mountain to the valley below , he said . The greater number of tree is due in part to year of forest agenc polici under which small natur fire were quickli extinguish to protect home and other properti in the mountain .But smaller , less intens fire are nature way of thin the forest , cull tree that are less fire-resist , said Martha H. Conklin , a Merc professor and anoth princip investig with the observatori . Paradox , becaus fire suppress leav so much timber on the mountain , it can lead to much bigger and hotter fire , like the Rim Fire that burn 250,000 acr in and around Yosemit and destroy more than 100 structur in 2013 .Fire suppress is a controversi subject in California . But thin the forest by let small fire run their cours would increas snowpack becaus more of the snow would reach the ground , and less of the water would be taken up by the tree . That could be , in effect , like ad an entir new reservoir of water in the mountain , rather than build a new billion-dollar reservoir down in the valley .If small fire were allow to burn , Dr. Conklin said , youd have a forest of a veri differ structure. Even the type of tree would eventu chang , she said , as speci that are better abl to resist fire replac other . I dont know if we can ever go back to a forest that ha a natur fire regim ,  Dr. Conklin said . It veri difficult to let a fire burn if you have hous dispers in the forest.But with climat chang affect how much water is avail from the mountain , she ad , we have to think about how wer go to manag these forests.', 'Start on Sunday , more than 150 countri and territori will switch to a new oral polio vaccin .

Measur about 65 centimet , or just over two feet tall , with strike yellow eye and a yellow band across it head , it is the rarest speci of penguin , nest in the forest and return to it . It is also sever endang .Despit variou measur deploy in recent year to protect thi penguin flock , the outlook remain bleak . On averag , onli 18 of 100 penguin chick surviv their first year at sea . A decad ago , the popul wa estim at 6,000 . Today conservationist reckon that onli 2,000 yellow-ey penguin are aliv .Thi bird could soon becom extinct unless urgent protect measur are taken ,  said Fergu Sutherland , who for 25 year ha been the caretak of a penguin reserv , Te Rere , span 67 hectar , or 166 acr , in the Catlin forest .The yellow-ey penguin first got into troubl when larg part of it natur habitat were destroy in the previou centuri . Farmer bulldoz and torch the forest where the penguin live to make way for cattl and sheep . The Te Rere Reserv wa found in 1989 , when Mr. Sutherland succeed in persuad farmer not to destroy the forest on the southern tip of the South Island .Eventu , reforest effort allow about 120 yellow-ey penguin to nest in the scrub . In Februari 1995 , howev , a fire start by a neighbor farm spread to Te Rere , burn half the popul .Mr. Sutherland regularli check box trap set in the forest to catch ferret , stoat and rat that prey on the young , flightless bird , refil the trap with fresh egg for bait . The penguin also fall victim to cat and dog .Over the summer here , some of the road to the beach were close to the public , to protect the penguin . There are sign warn that person caus distress to penguin will be prosecut ,  and the gener public can watch the penguin onli from special observ hut as they waddl off to sea at dawn , then disappear again into the forest at the end of a day forag .Dure the 100-day nest season end in Februari , Yolanda van Heezik , a marin biologist at the Univers of Otago in New Zealand , and Jim Watt , a ranger with the Depart of Conserv , monitor the condit of seven penguin nest on a beach on the Otago Peninsula .Breed pair alway make their nest out of sight of other penguin ,  Dr. van Heezik said .Mr. Watt visit the babi chick about 30 time , weigh them regularli even though the task can be hazard .They can use their flipper like a machin rifl and have a nasti bite ,  Mr. Watt said . He often hand-fe underweight chick a salmon smoothi . Sever malnourish penguin are cart off in a plastic crate to Penguin Place , a special rehabilit center .Young penguin often succumb to heat stress , as wa the case in Decemb when temperatur reach 95 degre . And in recent year , mani chick have suffer from avian diphtheria , which caus ulcer in their mouth that make it difficult to eat and breath .While the yellow-ey penguin may be well protect on land now , they spend most of their day at sea , where they are on their own . Last year veterinarian had to sutur about 50 yellow-ey penguin that were wound in barracuda or shark attack . Fish popul are low , so penguin are be attack as they compet for the same food ,  said David McFarlan , field manag of the Yellow-ey Penguin Trust , a nonprofit conserv group .For year , conservationist have been call for a restrict on fish to help protect the penguin . But Mr. Sutherland , a member of the South-East Marin Protect Forum , a government-appoint group that recommend marine-protect site to the govern , complain that the polit lobbi of the fish industri is much stronger than us.On the other side of the debat is Nelson Cross , who repres recreat fishermen on the forum , and oppos further restrict on fish . While Mr. Cross acknowledg that there were unfortun occasion instanc where a penguin ha been caught in a commerci trawl ,  he ad that there wa no evid that recreat fish impact in ani way on the penguins.The scientist , not the fishermen , he argu , were the real offend .

The research found that bacteria make up most of life branch . And they found that much of that divers ha been wait in plain sight to be discov , dwell in river mud and meadow soil .It is a moment discoveri  an entir contin of life-form ,  said Eugen V. Koonin of the Nation Center for Biotechnolog Inform , who wa not involv in the studi .The studi wa publish in the journal Natur Microbiolog .In hi 1859 book On the Origin of Speci ,  Charl Darwin envis evolut like a branch tree . The great Tree of Life ,  he said , fill with it dead and broken branch the crust of the earth , and cover the surfac with it ever branch and beauti ramifications.Ever sinc , biologist have sought to draw the tree of life . The invent of DNA sequenc revolution that project , becaus scientist could find the relationship among speci encod in their gene .In the 1970 , Carl Woes of the Univers of Illinoi and hi colleagu publish the first univers tree of life base on thi approach . They present the tree as three great trunk .Our own trunk , known as eukaryot , includ anim , plant , fungi and protozoan . A second trunk includ mani familiar bacteria like Escherichia coli .The third trunk that Woes and hi colleagu identifi includ little-known microb that live in extrem place like hot spring and oxygen-fre wetland . Woes and hi colleagu call thi third trunk Archaea .Scientist who want to add new speci to thi tree of life have face a daunt challeng : They do not know how to grow the vast major of single-cel organ in their laboratori .A number of research have develop a way to get around that . They simpli pull piec of DNA out of the environ and piec them togeth .In recent year , Jillian F. Banfield of the Univers of California , Berkeley and her colleagu have been gather DNA from mani environ , like California meadow and deep sea vent . They have been assembl the genom of hundr of new microbi speci .The scientist were so busi reconstruct the new genom that they did not know how these speci might fit on the tree of life . We never realli put the whole thing togeth ,  Dr. Banfield said .Recent , Dr. Banfield and her colleagu decid it wa time to redraw the tree .They select more than 3,000 speci to studi , bring togeth a repres sampl of life divers . We want to be as comprehens as possibl ,  said Laura A . Hug , an author of the new studi and a biologist at the Univers of Waterloo in Canada .The research studi DNA from 2,072 known speci , along with the DNA from 1,011 speci newli discov by Dr. Banfield and her colleagu .The scientist need a supercomput to evalu a vast number of possibl tree . Eventu , they found one best support by the evid .It a humbl thing to behold . All the eukaryot , from human to flower to amoeba , fit on a slender twig . The new studi support previou find that eukaryot and archaea are close relat . But overshadow those lineag is a sprawl menageri of bacteria .Remark , the scientist didnt have to go to extrem place to find mani of their new lineag . Meadow soil is one of the most microbi complex environ on the planet ,  Dr . Hug said .Anoth new featur of the tree is a singl , larg branch that split off near the base . The bacteria in thi group tend to be small in size and have a simpl metabol .Dr. Banfield specul that they got their start as simpl life-form in the first chapter in the histori of life . They have stuck with that win formula ever sinc .Thi is mayb an earli evolv group ,  Dr. Banfield said . Their advantag is just be around for a realli long time.Brian P. Hedlund , a microbiologist at the Univers of Nevada , La Vega who wa not involv in the new studi , said that one of the most strike result of the studi wa that the tree of life wa domin by speci that scientist have never been abl to see or grow in their lab . Most of life is hide under our nose ,  he said .Patrick Forterr , an evolutionari biologist at the Pasteur Institut in Franc , agre that bacteria probabl make up much of life divers . But he had concern about how Dr. Banfield and her colleagu built their tree . He argu that genom assembl from DNA fragment could actual be chimera , made up of gene from differ speci . It a real problem ,  he said .Dr. Banfield predict that the bacteri branch of the tree of life may not chang much in year to come . Wer start to see the same thing over and over again ,  she said .Instead , Dr. Banfield said she expect new branch to be discov for eukaryot , especi for tini speci such as microscop fungi . That where I think the next big advanc might be found ,  Dr. Banfield said .Dr . Hug disagre that scientist were done with bacteria . Im less convinc wer hit a plateau ,  she said .

Galach , an astronom at the Intern Astronom Union Minor Planet Center in Cambridg , Mass. , to figur out just how like a spacecraft would get hit by an asteroid . In our solar system , most asteroid , perhap a billion of them 100 meter or wider , can be found in a circular belt between the orbit of Mar and Jupit .He calcul for those billion asteroid that are bigger than a footbal field , there would be just one asteroid per 33 quadrillion cubic mile . That mean that in a cube 320,000 mile on a side  that a volum equal to some 120,000 Earth  there would be , on averag , just one asteroid insid .NASA take advantag of thi fortun circumst everi time it send a spacecraft to the outer solar system .Dure nine mission  most recent NASA Juno mission on it way to Jupit , noth of signific ha ever collid with a spacecraft .

A bulki milepost ?Carlton Hall point to the puzzl object and explain that it wa onc a tie-down block for secur structur like antenna tower . Dr. Hall , the chief scientist for the space center ecolog program , said that when he start work here a few decad ago , the block had been buri . Now the sand that envelop it is gone , swept away by the forc of coastal eros and storm .He gestur toward the wave roll in nearbi and said , The beach use to be at least 50 yard out.On the other side of the dune , a quarter mile away , sit two artifici hill some 50 feet high . Those are NASA two biggest launchpad . And to the south sit sever smaller one .Thi is America busiest spaceport , and the water is come .Like so much of Florida , the Space Coast  a 72-mile stretch along the Atlant  is feel the threat of climat chang . Some of the eros is caus by the churn energi of ocean current along the coastlin . Hurrican Sandi , whose power wa almost certainli strengthen by climat chang , took a big bite in 2012 , flatten an alreadi damag dune line that provid protect from the Atlantic batter .A rise sea level will bring even greater risk over time  and perhap sooner than most research expect . Accord to a studi publish last week , warm pressur on the Antarct ice sheet could help push sea level higher by as much as five or six feet by the end of thi centuri .NASA isnt just a victim of climat chang . It contribut to climat scienc in mani way , and not onli in the data from the mani satellit that orbit the planet after leav Earth from here .It astronaut also help build awar of the grow urgenc of climat chang . Astronaut Scott Kelli , who recent return from nearli a year in space , took hundr of photograph that could seem like abstract art or a dire warn ; in an email interview just befor hi descent , he said that he had seen chang in the planet even sinc hi previou mission in 2010 .It seem to me there is more pollut in India and China than what I saw last time ,  he said . Definit notic the fire thi summer in the U.S.A. ; sometim , could see the smoke all the way to Chicago.Weather system where they are not suppos to be obviou ,  he ad . The fragil of the atmospher alway apparent.NASA , which ha at least $ 32 billion worth of structur and facil around the countri , ha been consid the possibl effect of climat chang for nearli a decad , said Kim W. Toufecti , a strategist who lead the master plan program for the space agenc .NASA , after all , is in the busi of risk manag . By 2007 , we had to acknowledg that we should recogn climat chang and extrem weather as a formal risk that we should be actual manag ,  Mr. Toufecti said .With all of it expertis and it abil to make forecast base on data , Mr. Toufecti ad , shame on us if we are not capit on that.In fact , NASA climat risk extend far beyond Florida . About two-third of the land that NASA manag is within 16 feet of mean sea level , and much of it is near the coast . We are tremend link to the drink ,  Mr. Toufecti said .Johnson Space Center in Texa sit by Clear Lake , an inlet of Galveston Bay and the Gulf of Mexico .

Ame Research Center is near San Francisco Bay .The agency Climat Adapt Scienc Investig work group , which evalu risk for all feder agenc , ha predict that sea level rise of five inch to more than two feet by 2050 could caus widespread problem for the five coastal NASA site .Coastal flood that might now occur onc everi 10 year could happen twice as often at Johnson , twice to three time as often at Kennedi and 10 time more often at Ame .NASA coastal center that are alreadi at risk of flood are virtual certain to becom more vulner in the futur ,  the work group wrote in a 2014 report .The agenc brought togeth the manag for each center to learn directli from NASA scientist about climat chang risk . They took field trip to the vulner area in 2009 .It becam veri real ,  said Cynthia E. Rosenzweig , senior research scientist at the NASA Goddard Institut for Space Studi in New York , and an author of the 2014 report .At Kennedi Space Center , of cours , the element are alway a challeng . The air off the sea attack delic equip and rust structur . Hurrican occasion come through , as well . In 2004 , Hurrican Franc tore hundr of side panel off the gargantuan Vehicl Assembl Build , requir extens repair . Storm in 2007 and 2008 batter the shore .Then in 2012 , Hurrican Sandi sent a surg that hit the coast like a scour pad , level about a mile of dune protect and leav the landscap stretch toward the launchpad cover with sand .Alreadi , NASA ha spent much of a $ 3 million appropri to rebuild a long dune to replac protect sand that have been wash away .NASA sit in the middl of a vast wildlif refug , so replac the dune wa a more delic job than simpli send in bulldoz and pile up dirt .Those do the work had to be consider of the wildlif , like the endang gopher tortois , with it high-dom shell .The sand that NASA brought in had to resembl the sand that had been wash away , so the tortois would be comfort rebuild burrow and sea turtl would be abl to return to the site to nest . Worker took cut of plant from the old dune , grew them and put in 180,000 individu plant to secur the new dune . Now they are grow thick with grass , sea oat , purple-flow railroad vine and palmetto .No one doubt , howev , that more storm will come , and the warmer air and water brought by climat chang are like to lead to more destruct storm .As climat chang threaten , NASA ha option that includ harden facil against the rise sea with barrier and structur adapt to storm and flood , or if adapt is not possibl , to strateg retreat . Ani such strategi will be expens  though how expens at thi earli stage is anyone guess .Retreat , howev , is hardli an option ani time soon for an agenc that would need billion of dollar for new build and equip alon  not to mention the need to reloc staff with extens expertis .One thing is certain : Pad will still be need . Kennedi Space Center will be the home to NASA next-gener human spaceflight vehicl , and it pad are be use by privat space compani like SpaceX and Unit Launch Allianc .In fact , the Space Coast is enjoy a reviv sinc the dire year after the space shuttl program wa mothbal in 2011 .Christoph J. Ferguson , a former astronaut who now head Boeing effort to develop a new crew capsul for futur launch , said he wa excit to see the renew activ . Commun along the Space Coast , he said , went through veri tri times. Hous valu plummet and commerc eb . Even Shuttl , the space-them restaur and bar nearbi on Merritt Island , shut down . Now the cold beer and cheeseburg are back .The question is , for how long ?Which lead to anoth obviou question : Whi build billion of dollar worth of launch infrastructur on a riski coast in the first place ?Safeti and physic tell the tale . Launch over water is safer than over land and peopl . Also , rocket are best launch from site closer to the Earth fat Equat , where the greater diamet of the planet provid a slingshot effect that give each rocket more bang for the propuls buck . The Air Forc wa alreadi fire missil from Cape Canaver when NASA show up .The idea of fire from Florida preced space travel by nearli 100 year . In 1865 , Jule Vern foresaw launch from Tampa in From the Earth to the Moon.Vern , in fact , even envis a competit for the launch site between Florida and the Gulf Coast of Texa , with a pitch polit battl for the plum program . In real life , Florida got the launch , and coastal Texa got the Johnson Space Center , home to mission control and astronaut train . Special barg from Michoud carri the overs shuttl fuel tank too big for easi passag on rail or road  via the Intracoast Waterway to Kennedi Space Center .And that is the conundrum for NASA . Water , onc the solut to mani of the space agency problem , is becom it biggest threat .', 'Nearli 20 year ago , after a chess-play comput call Deep Blue beat the world grandmast Garri Kasparov , I wrote an articl about whi human would long remain the champion in the game of Go .It may be a hundr year befor a comput beat human at Go  mayb even longer ,  Dr. Piet Hut , an astrophysicist and Go enthusiast at the Institut for Advanc Studi in Princeton , N.J. , told me in 1997 . If a reason intellig person learn to play Go , in a few month he could beat all exist comput program . You dont have to be a Kasparov.That wa the prevail wisdom . Last month , after a Googl comput program call AlphaGo defeat the Go master Lee Se-dol , I ask Dr. Hut for hi reaction . I wa way off , clearli , with my predict ,  he repli in an email . It realli stunning.At the time , hi pessim seem well found . While Deep Blue had been train and program by IBM with some knowledg about chess , it advantag lay primarili in what comput scientist call brute-forc search . At each step of the game Deep Blue would rapidli look ahead , explor a maze of hypothet move and countermov and counter-countermov . Then it would make the choic that it algorithm rank as the best . No live brain could possibl move so fast .But in Go , an ancient board game renown for it complex , the ever-fork space of possibl is so much vaster that sheer electron speed wa not nearli enough . Captur in a comput someth closer to human intuit  the abil to seek and respond to meaning pattern  seem crucial and veri far away .Other seemingli distant goal includ the abil to translat automat between two languag or to recogn speech with enough accuraci to be use outsid the laboratori . Comput scientist had alreadi spent decad tri to crack these problem .For mani , the aim wa not just to make an artifici intellig , but to understand deep principl of syntax , semant and phonet , and even what it mean to think .Now anyon with a smartphon or laptop ( commun by Internet with a supercomput cloud ) can get a rough translat of text in mani languag . They can dictat instead of type . Photo softwar can sort not just by date and locat but by the face of the subject .The result are imperfect and often clumsi , but they would have been mind-blow in 1997 . What happen between then and now ?Of cours , comput becam ever more power . But even today fastest arent abl to anticip all of the permut of a situat like play Go . Success on thi and other front ha come from har speed in other way .The breakthrough in translat came from set asid the question of what it mean to understand a languag and just find a technolog that work . The autom system start with a text that ha alreadi been translat , by human brain . Then both version are fed to a comput . By rapidli compar the two , the machin compil a thicket of statist correl , associ word and phrase with their like foreign counterpart .Similar approach , more artifici than intellig , have led to surprisingli rapid improv in recogn speech and facial imag , as well as with play championship Go .In AlphaGo , learn algorithm , call deep neural net , were train use a databas of million of move made in the past by human player . Then it refin thi knowledg by play one split-second game after anoth against itself .Tweak by algorithm tweak , it becam ever more adept at the game . By combin thi insens learn , which amount to mani human lifetim of experi , with a techniqu call Mont Carlo tree search , name for the abil to randomli sampl a univers of possibl move , AlphaGo prevail .That wa an enorm victori . But the glori goe not to the comput program but to the human brain that pull it off . At the end of the tournament in Seoul , South Korea , 15 of them took the stage . They repres just a fraction of the number of peopl it took to invent and execut all of the technolog involv . Lee Se-dol wa play against an armi .Back in 1997 I wrote , To play a decent game of Go , a comput must be endow with the abil to recogn subtl , complex pattern and to draw on the kind of intuit knowledg that is the hallmark of human intelligence. Defeat a human Go champion , I wrote , will be a sign that artifici intellig is truli begin to becom as good as the real thing.That doesnt seem so true anymor . Ingeni learn algorithm combin with big data have led to impress accomplish  what ha even been call bottl intuit . But artifici intellig is far from rival the fluiditi of the human mind .Human can learn to recogn pattern on a Go board  and pattern relat to face and pattern in languag  and even pattern of pattern ,  said Melani Mitchel , a comput scientist at Portland State Univers and the Santa Fe Institut . Thi is what we do everi second of everi day . But AlphaGo onli recogn pattern relat to Go board and ha no abil to gener beyond that  even to game similar to Go but with differ rule .Also , it take million of train exampl for AlphaGo to learn to recogn pattern ,  she continu , wherea it onli seem to take human a few.Comput scientist are experi with program that can gener far more effici . But the squishi neural net in our head  shape by half a billion year of evolut and given a train set as big as the world  can still hold their own against ultra-high-spe comput design by team of human , program for a singl purpos and given an enorm head start .It wa a regrett game , but I enjoy it ,  Mr. Lee said dure the award ceremoni .

An older woman , she is about to undergo a catheter when she suddenli realiz that it is time for her to head back to her home planet , and posit herself accordingli .Great stori all , and a less ambiti writer would have content himself with the detail . But Dr. Nussbaum steer hi narr directli to the hard question about 21st-centuri medicin , a profess just about as various troubl as hi patient .Call him a medic millenni question a past that seem bare relev to hi present . None of the usual medic hero appli . Even the endur William Osler , who start the hospit resid system at the turn of the 20th centuri and is routin worship as a medic saint , come up short . Osler wa all about the physic evid of ill , and Dr. Nussbaum fault him for see the bodi primarili as a collect of diseas part , a decidedli incomplet view.Few of Osler heir strike Dr. Nussbaum as free of their own shortcom .He note that partisan of today much promot evidence-bas medicin must determinedli finess the fact that medicin is riddl with flaw , incomplet evid . The leader of genom revolut trumpet a futur that keep be postpon . Quality-control guru abound , but their work often fail to yield actual qualiti .And those who would updat and streamlin medic routin offer up paradigm Dr. Nussbaum find simpli bizarr . He point to Atul Gawand , the Harvard surgeon and health polici writer who in a New Yorker articl laud the abil of larg chain restaur like the Cheesecak Factori to serv a uniform , reproduc product thousand of time over . Dr. Gawand charg medicin to do likewis , but that imag of the physician as a line cook feed faceless stranger doe not inspir Dr. Nussbaum .Still , if a doctor is to be neither part mechan nor line cook , then what ? Dr. Nussbaum consid some altern .Perhap , he muse , doctor should emul ballroom dancer , gentli lead patient in a seri of measur classic routin .

Health offici are urg peopl to use insect repel with DEET to avoid be bitten .The mount evid that the viru is strongli link with birth defect make thi a prioriti for pregnant women . But is it safe to use repel contain DEET with a babi on the way ?Although the scientif evid is a bit thinner than some expert would like , most say the answer is ye , as long as you do not overappli .Few publish studi address the effect of DEET , short for N , N-diethyl-meta-toluamid , in mothers-to-b and their offspr . None involv pregnant women in the first trimest , the period when most birth defect occur .Still , the exist evid in pregnant women is reassur . Even though there is not a lot of research , it make sens to use DEET to protect yourself from someth we know is truli unsaf , like Zika ,  said Dr. Laura E. Riley , a specialist who work with high-risk pregnanc and infecti diseas at Massachusett Gener Hospit .A random trial of roughli 900 women in Thailand , publish in 2001 , provid some of the strongest evid that use DEET daili for month will probabl not hurt a fetu .A malaria infect in pregnanc can lead to miscarriag or stillbirth . To prevent it , half of the women in the studi appli a 20 percent concentr of DEET mix with a makeup call thanaka daili in their second and third trimest . The other half wore onli thanaka .DEET can cross the placenta and reach the fetu , the research found . But DEET wa detect in the blood of the umbil cord in just four of 50 user .Importantli , the newborn werent affect in term of growth or develop from DEET exposur ,  said Dr. Rose McGreadi , the study lead author and a professor of tropic matern and child health at the Univers of Oxford . No advers effect on growth were found among the children a year later , either .But the studi didnt includ the first trimest ,  Dr. McGreadi said . That an import miss component.Ask about the pauciti of publish studi look at DEET use in the first trimest , Jack Houseng , the director of the Environment Protect Agency offic of pesticid program , repli in a statement , DEET is safe , includ for pregnant women at ani stage.In 2014 , a safeti review by the E.P.A . did not identifi ani risk of concern to human health if the direct are follow . The agency review assess the potenti risk of long- and short term use of DEET in pregnant anim .The Center for Diseas Control and Prevent counsel pregnant women to use ani E.P.A.-regist repel , includ those with picaridin ( a synthet compound ) , IR3535 ( a biopesticid ) and DEET . In anim studi , the E.P.A . ha found no evid that either picaridin or IR3535 is harm to the develop fetu .DEET wa regist with the E.P.A . for public use in 1957 , picaridin in 2005 and IR3535 in 1999 , but the last two were use abroad for year befor .Bob Peterson , a professor of entomolog at Montana State Univers , publish a risk assess of DEET and picaridin in 2008 . Exposur are accept in adult and children if they are use accord to instruct on the packag ,  he said .An estim 104 million American use DEET everi year , and report of advers event are rel small by comparison ,  the E.P.A . wrote in it safeti review .Onli minim amount of DEET cross into a pregnant mother bloodstream , suggest babi are expos to veri littl .In 2010 , research , includ some from the C.D.C. , analyz the blood of 150 pregnant women in New Jersey and their umbil cord for a rang of pesticid .DEET wa not at remark level ,  said Mark Robson , the study senior author and a professor of plant biolog and patholog at Rutger Univers . Birth weight , length and circumfer were all normal for all infant .Pregnant women who wish to be extrem cautiou may use a repel with a lower concentr of DEET to limit how much get in their blood , said Dr. Sarah G.

Onc found throughout New Zealand , the popul ha dwindl to fewer than 150 .Conserv biologist are do everyth they can to keep the kakapo from vanish . And so , when they discov a few year ago that a pair of captiv kakapo were infect with tapeworm , they did the obviou thing : They deworm the bird .Hamish G. Spencer , a geneticist at the Univers of Otago in New Zealand , think that wa unwis . If endang speci are go to escap extinct , he argu , they may need parasit to surviv .Some of these parasit may turn out to be quit good for their host ,  Dr. Spencer said .We tend to think of speci that live insid host as disease-caus enemi . That may be true  but onli up to a point . Medic studi have shown that human have evolv an intim , perhap even necessari , relationship with mani of these lodger .Five decad ago , research first began to find evid of an upsid to parasit . In 1968 , for exampl , Brian M. Greenwood of the London School of Hygien and Tropic Medicin observ that peopl in Nigeria had lower level of arthriti and other immune-rel diseas than peopl in Britain . He suggest that chronic infect with intestin worm or other parasit moder the immun system in Nigerian , reduc the risk that the body own tissu would be attack .Evid accumul over the decad for what came to be known as the hygien hypothesi . Support argu that over the past two centuri , modern civil ha radic chang our relationship with our inner resid .For million of year , our evolv bodi had to strike a tricki balanc . We depend on a power immun system to fend off deadli infect . But if the immun system were to attack indiscrimin , it could destroy the body benefici bacteria , for exampl , or damag it tissu with relentless inflamm .Accord to the hygien hypothesi , our ancestor came to toler low level of infect . They even came to depend on parasit to help the immun system develop properli .That not to say that parasit becam an unalloy good . Our relationship with them is instead a complic trade-off .Have worm can mean you have fewer allergi when you grow up , but it could also stunt your growth ,  said Marlen Zuk , an evolutionari biologist at the Univers of Minnesota . Nobodi promis you thi wa go to work out realli well.In the 19th centuri , thi ancient relationship chang . Thank to clean food and water , a grow number of peopl were freed from parasit . The Industri Revolut also took peopl away from farm , so they came into less contact with dirt and parasite-bear livestock . They experienc fewer infect with virus , bacteria and intestin worm .Propon of the hygien hypothesi argu that it no coincid that peopl in industri countri also began experienc more allergi , asthma , Crohn diseas and other immune-rel disord .Write in the journal Trend in Ecolog and Evolut , Dr. Spencer and Dr. Zuk point out that what true for human may well be true for other anim , too . Conserv biologist , they say , may be unwittingli run an experi on speci theyr tri to save from extinct .In the wild , a healthi anim may be rife with intestin worm and other inhabit . Everyth ha parasit , and usual multipl speci of parasit that live in all sort of place ,  Dr. Spencer said .To care for captiv breed popul , biologist will typic treat infect with aggress medic . While those treatment may save the live of some anim , they may also have a downsid . Aggress medicin may endang captiv anim by remov parasit that help their immun system develop normal . And , Dr. Spencer and Dr. Zuk argu , these anim may end up unprepar for the diseas they may encount should they be return to the wild .Human histori ha shown how danger thi can be : European colonist , for exampl , introduc smallpox and other diseas to far-flung popul .In the wild , a speci may regain the old relationship with it parasit . But aggress human intervent may also forev sever some link between host and parasit .It turn out that if you look at organ , you discov that a surpris number of them have parasit that onli occur on that speci or perhap that speci and a coupl of close rel , and that it ,  Dr. Spencer said .Treat captiv anim for infect may help hasten these parasit into oblivion and , with them , the mechan the endang speci need to fine-tun it immun system .Parasit extinct isnt just a theoret possibl . When California biologist brought all the surviv California condor into captiv in the 1980 , they end up erad Colpocephalum californici , a speci of feather lous found onli on those bird .Dr. Spencer suspect we have wipe out other parasit without realiz it . No one know what speci of tapeworm wa infect the kakapo , but deworm them may have driven it extinct .It possibl , Dr. Spencer said , that the lack of parasit may help explain whi some speci restor project have been disappoint . There are a number of case where reintroduc popul havent done veri well ,  he said . It might be that their immun system are not veri good.Albrecht I. Schulte-Hostedd , the director of the Center for Evolutionari Ecolog and Ethic Conserv at Laurentian Univers in Sudburi , Ontario , said it wa import for conserv biologist and veterinarian to appreci thi evolutionari perspect . But he expect it would be difficult to chang their attitud .It go to be a hard sell ,  he said .Even if those attitud chang , research still need to learn a lot more about parasit to manag them .I freeli admit thi is a daunt prospect , but we have to start somewher ,  Dr. Zuk said .A first step , Dr. Spencer said , would be to stop medic captiv anim so freeli . We are argu against the idea that you just dose the hell out of everyth befor you put anim back in the wild ,  he said .', 'It call wing song .

They travel to Uganda to record and analyz just how the bird produc what the studi call a loud brreeeet while make a quick , circular flight from it perch .Dr. Clark , now a biologist at the Univers of California , Riversid , wa a research at Yale in the laboratori of Dr. Prum , an ornithologist and evolutionari biologist , when they went to Africa recent for research . But Dr. Prum interest goe way back .I first heard a tape of thi bird in the mid-80 ,  Dr. Prum said , and Iv been obsess with them go on 30 years.He had studi the wing song of manakin , but the broadbil were still on hi mind when Dr. Clark , who had been research the sound hummingbird make with their tail , arriv at Yale .Their flight video , with synchron sound , show that the male bird  the one who sing  made the breeeeet on downstrok of the wing . The research went on to test a broadbil wing and individu feather in a wind tunnel .Two of the outer primari feather on the wing respond to wind and produc the loudest sound with a kind of movement call aeroelast flutter . Thi is the mechan found in hummingbird tail feather , and it is one of sever way that feather can make bird call .The mani speci of bird that have evolv male nonvoc call present a puzzl to Dr. Prum : Whi the hell would anyon evolv a total new way to make sound ?  They had voic box first and develop wing and tail sound later .I dont think we have an answer ,  he said . It not just about inform commun . It not just about the right frequency. .What it might be about , he said , is aesthet innovation. Novelti itself might be a factor in the evolut of sexual display by these male bird .What is import is the sensori delight of the femal ,  he ad . What do they like ?

But of cours , that not what wer saying.Temperatur measur go back to the 19th centuri show , unfortun , that global warm is real . As of the end of last year , the warm to date wa about 1.8 degre Fahrenheit over the entireti of Earth surfac , includ the ocean , which pull down the averag . The result of that seemingli modest chang have been pretti spectacular : million of acr of die forest , melt of land ice all over the planet , a rapid collaps of Arctic sea ice .Scientist project that continu high emiss of greenhous gase could lead to as much as five or six degre of addit warm over the cours of thi centuri , with potenti drastic effect on food product , sea level and weather .Yet even in a far warmer climat , scientist expect that winter will continu to exist  mean there will alway be someon who can hurl a snowbal . Some place could even cool as the world warm overal .Climat scientist sometim make an analog to smoke and cancer . Most peopl know that it is possibl to get lung cancer even if they have never smoke ; they know that smoke greatli increas the odd ; and they know that even some of the heaviest smoker manag to beat those odd .Similarli , scientist expect continu emiss to caus a huge shift in the odd of , say , record-set heat wave , but that doe not mean it will be hot all the time or in everi part of the world . Moreov , onli the earliest of these chang have been felt so far ; unless emiss fall sharpli , the biggest effect are still decad away .Wer kind of like the smoker who hasnt smoke too mani cigarett a day for too mani year yet ,  Dr. Sobel said .

Mani public health group , profession societi and health site on the Internet promot thi exercis prescript , promis it will stave off weak bone . But osteoporosi research know the advic is not back up by rigor studi .The idea may have begun as an extrapol of a well-known fact : Peopl who are bedridden lose bone mass . So do astronaut who spend time weightless . The pull of graviti seem to be need for bone strength . But is there a threshold beyond which bone are about as strong as they will be from the forc of graviti ? Is everyday walk around just as good as run a marathon ? Those studi did not say .The answer came a littl more than a decad ago when scientist did rigor studi , ask if weight bear exercis increas bone densiti in adult . They use DEXA machin , which measur bone densiti by hit bone with X-ray . Those studi fail to find anyth more than a minuscul exercis effect  on the order of 1 percent or less , which is too small to be clinic signific . As expect , DEXA found bone loss in peopl who were bedridden and in astronaut . But there wa no evid that bone wa gain when peopl walk or ran .Scientist have continu to investig as test for bone densiti grow ever more sensit . More recent , use new and veri expens machin that scan bone and are abl to show it structur at a microscop scale , they report a tini exercis effect in one part of the bone architectur known as the trabecula , littl branch insid bone that link to each other . The cortic shell  the outer layer of bone  also seem to be slightli thicker with weight bear exercis . But these are minut chang , note Dr. Clifford Rosen , a bone research at the Main Medic Research Institut . There is no evid that they make bone stronger or protect it from osteoporosi , he said .All that can be said is that if exercis build bone , it doe not build much bone . Which isnt to say that exercis can not protect bone in other way . Studi have found that older peopl who did weight bear exercis decreas their risk of fractur . But thi seem to be more like explain by the fact that exercis lead to stronger muscl that in turn made fall less like .At thi point noth except inject of parathyroid hormon and , perhap , a new inject drug call abaloparatid now be test in clinic trial , make bone denser and stronger . Popular osteoporosi drug like Fosamax slow the rate of bone loss , but they do not build bone .There is a glimmer of hope for those who have put their faith in exercis . Perhap , osteoporosi research say , even though bone do not get stronger with exercis , exercis might make bone healthier in term of a mysteri properti call bone qualiti . No one know exactli what it is but it may help explain whi some peopl with bone that look strong get fractur while other with bone that look fragil do not .

Well see who wins.', 'At a preview of the new American Museum of Natur Histori exhibit Dinosaur Among Us ,  scientist gave a tip of the hat to Thoma Henri Huxley , the man who propos in the 1860 that dinosaur never realli vanish from Earth . Most did go extinct , but their evolutionari legaci live all around us . They are bird , all 18,000 speci of them .While Charl Darwin book of book , On the Origin of Speci by Mean of Natur Select ,  wa still in print in 1859 , Huxley , a lectur in paleontolog and natur histori in London , wrote a favor review and becam a convert to Darwin theori . In a debat the next year , Huxley got the better of the bishop of Oxford , and becam known thereaft as Darwin bulldog . He wa also the first in a long line of Huxley who distinguish themselv in scienc and the art .A few year later , Huxley enlist Archaeopteryx , a fossil specimen found in a Bavarian limeston quarri , in hi defens of Darwin . He wa struck by the specimen mani reptilian featur ; but for a feather in the fossil , it would probabl have been misidentifi as a reptil . In a report in 1867 , Huxley establish the evolutionari relationship of bird and reptil , cite 14 anatom featur that occur in bird and reptil alik , but not in mammal .Archaeopteryx wa one of those miss links in the fossil record that Darwin worri wa a weak in thi theori of evolut . Huxley call attent to the feather and wishbon of thi earli bird and the long boni tail of a reptil . Thi wa a speci in transit .Whi ha it taken so long to recogn that Huxley had almost certainli been right about the origin of bird from some meat-eat theropod dinosaur ?Mark A. Norel , the chairman of the divis of paleontolog at A.M.N.H . and curat of the exhibit , had long been a staunch propon of a dinosaur-bird link . A lot of evid amass over the last two decad , especi the number of feather dinosaur found in China , move paleontologist to organ the exhibit as a kind of victori lap .I think thi is realli go to shake up the way peopl think of dinosaur ,  Dr. Norel said .Most ornithologist , though not complet won over , had alreadi ceas rais blanket object to the dinosaur-bird link . They seem at a loss to conceiv of altern explan for the gather evid , paleontologist say .The slow evolut of the practic of paleontolog itself wa anoth reason for the delay in recogn Huxley insight . For the rest of the 19th centuri and the first half of the 20th , the big game of fossil hunt wa the bigger and more bizarr dinosaur that drew peopl to museum . Expedit to remot land widen the search to nearli all contin , pile up skeleton faster than could be analyz in depth .Roy Chapman Andrew becam the real-lif Indiana Jone in the 1920 , bring back from the Gobi Desert of Mongolia a varieti of new dinosaur speci and the first dinosaur egg . If onli he had found feather dinosaur then and there , paleontologist say , the dinosaur-bird link might have been recogn much sooner . That wa not to happen until the end of the centuri .By that time , the field work of fossil hunter remain import , but onli as the first step in discoveri . For exampl , in 1964 , John H. Ostrom of Yale Univers saw a birdlik claw stick out of the ground in Montana . He name the dinosaur Deinonychu , or terribl claw. But it remind him of Huxley evolutionari insight , lead Dr. Ostrom to link bird to new gener of dinosaur research .In the last two or three decad , biolog disciplin have join dinosaur studi , appli tool capabl of transcend the terribl claw limit of fossil skull and bone . Geologist onc domin the field , Dr. Norel said , but now so mani of us could be call paleobiologists.Also , thousand of fossil with feather imprint have been discov in Liaon Provinc in northeastern China in the last 15 year , Dr. Norel said . Bird are the onli feather creatur aliv today , but 150 million year ago , earli bird and dinosaur of all shape and size came with feather , not necessarili for flight . Feather , museum research said , are one of the most use skin cover that ever evolv for insul or mate display as well as glide or power flight .Paul C. Sereno , a Univers of Chicago paleontologist , ha analyz mani recent Chines fossil of anim that had live more than 100 million year ago that were found in lake bed sediment .Huxley wa a brilliant anatomist ,  Dr. Sereno said . Some of the first bird from the Chines site look just like Archaeopteryx . Thi time , the dinosaur-bird transit ha becom ascendant.So what is there not to like about evolut if it inde account for the few surviv dinosaur transform into flock of bird ? Monstrou dinosaur may captiv first grader , who thrill at be scare at a safe distanc in time .They may also draw comfort from know the eat habit ( carnivor or herbivor ) of dinosaur  their know-it-al grown-up cant even pronounc their name . Need there be more reason for a fascin with strang and mighti dinosaur when you are littl in a big world ?From my back porch in the countri , I hear crow squawk high in the tree . Crow are smart , clever enough to pri open garbag can down the road , if raccoon had not gotten there first  which might account for their squawk . Some bird , like blue jay at the feeder , seem to enjoy chase off chickade and sparrow .Better to be hear the bulli jay or cardin sing their vesper , howev , than to have a fearsom T-rex peer in at you through your upstair window at daybreak , readi for breakfast .', 'HANOI , VIETNAM  Dr. Bui Xuan Hiep , the head of tuberculosi control in thi city Hoang Mai district , page proudli through a larg handwritten patient log .Thi district cure rate averag 90 percent ,  he said . Still , Dr. Bui could see problem .Seven patient had turn up with multidrug-resist tuberculosi ; four had been cure , two had die  and one had simpli disappear .It a stori repeat throughout Vietnam . The nation wa onc rack by a tuberculosi epidem , one of the worst in which H.I.V . wa not the drive forc . But offici fought back fierc .Twenty-f year ago , batter by the aftermath of a long war , chronic poverti and a heavy-hand govern isol from much of the world , Vietnam had nearli 600 case of tuberculosi for everi 100,000 resid . Today , it ha less than 200 .The countri boast a 90 percent cure rate for uncompl tuberculosi and cure 75 percent of it drug-resist case , easili beat the global averag , 50 percent .Inde , public health offici worldwid have made remark progress against tuberculosi . Death from the diseas have fallen drastic sinc 2000 , accord to the World Health Organ . Tuberculosi ha been halt or revers in 16 of the 22 countri that account for the vast major of case .But Ban Ki-moon , secretary-gener of the Unit Nation , last week warn that the fight wa onli half won and estim that 1.5 million worldwid would die of the diseas thi year .There is no better exampl of how fragil thi success may be than Vietnam . Hospit ward here are pack danger full , rais the risk that drug-resist strain will spread .The easy-to-reach patient have been treat , and mani of the rest are the hardest to help : heroin-addict courier and labor from the poppi field of the nearbi Golden Triangl , and mountain villag who do not speak Vietnames and are bare connect to the health care system .But the biggest threat is that the money is close to run out .Our TB program is cost-effect and ha great impact ,  said Dr. Nguyen Viet Nhung , it nation director . But I alway emphas that thi is a preliminari success . We need to sustain it.To reach Vietnam ambiti goal of push preval rate down to 20 case per 100,000 resid  essenti elimin tuberculosi as a public health problem  it tuberculosis-control program need to spend at least $ 66 million a year . It now spend about $ 26 million a year .About $ 19 million of that come from foreign donor , with more than a third from the Unit State , Dr. Nguyen said . Evid of donor help is everywher .The expens diagnost machin in hospit laboratori bear sticker from the Unit State Agenc for Intern Develop or from The Global Fund to Fight AID , Tuberculosi and Malaria , 30 percent of whose budget is paid by the Unit State . But The Global Fund , the chief support of the tuberculosi program here , ha long struggl to meet it fundrais goal , and Vietnames offici worri about what happen when it current commit end in 2017 . The White Hous tri to reduc the American contribut to the fund in fiscal year 2016 ( Congress restor it ) , and propos cut to Usaid tuberculosi program in both 2016 and 2017 .Offici here and at the W.H.O . fear that hard-won progress may soon be revers and a remark success stori may come apart , with deadli consequ .After year in the shadow of the AID epidem , tuberculosi is regain it notorieti as one of the world great killer : an airborn bacterium that spread easili among peopl live crowd togeth  in jail , ship , mine , trench or slum  and insinu itself deep in the lung and grow , slowli tear apart the tissu until victim are cough up blood .Tuberculosi now kill more peopl around the world than AID , accord to the W.H.O . : 4,100 a day , compar with 3,300 die of AID , make tuberculosi the lead infecti caus of death in the world .Mortal from both diseas is drop , but tuberculosi death have fallen more slowli , especi in Asia .Vietnam success where so mani other nation have fail is not just becaus of donor money , said Dr. Mario C. Raviglion , the director of the W.H.O. global tuberculosi program .It succe becaus it a Communist countri ,  he said . Socialist countri put a lot of resourc into primari care : lot of doctor , lot of clinic . And onc central govern adopt a thing , they realli do it . They give orders.Tuberculosi is an ideal diseas for a regiment treatment approach .Almost all patient with uncomplicated tuberculosi  bacteria that are not drug-resist  can be cure if they take a standard menu of four antibiot everi day for six month without fail .In Vietnam , treatment standard set at the nation level are follow by the entir public health network . The Nation Lung Diseas Hospit in Hanoi overse 64 provinci hospit , which overse 845 district hospit , which overse 11,065 neighborhood health clinic .The pharmaceutical-suppli chain , the Achilles heel in mani tuberculosis-ridden countri , is impress . On a weeklong tour of urban and rural clinic , not one nurs or patient report ever run out of drug .Those neighborhood clinic  usual just a few examin room , a small pharmaci and a park lot  are as ubiquit here as polic station and firehous in the Unit State .They treat mani ill , but their role in tuberculosi is simpl : Everi tuberculosi patient in the district report onc a day to take hi or her pill in front of a nurs . Each dose taken is check off on a yellow card .Most patient compli without complaint , doctor say . Mani poor countri are chaotic ; Vietnam , while poor , is not . Park are neatli trim , public bathroom are clean , and polic in gold-button uniform and high-brim hat are omnipres .Nonetheless , there are a few stubborn patient  Dr. Bui miss patient wa a heroin addict who infect hi mother with drug-resist tuberculosi befor disappear . And the countri ha one surpris gap : It ha no quarantin law .In New York City outbreak of drug-resist tuberculosi in the 1990 , offici legal lock up patient who refus to take their pill . The rare noncompli patient here face no such threat .We cant do that ,  said Dr . Le Minh Hoa , the head of treatment at Hanoi provinci lung hospit . And besid , we dont have enough space for the peopl who want treatment.Patient with drug-resist diseas are especi hard to help . Their medicin , some of which are intraven , must be taken for two year , and can caus deaf , psychosi and kidney failur . Patient must be hospit , their movement restrict to one or two corridor , sometim for month until they are no longer cough up live bacteria .Hospit ward are full of stoop , forlorn-look men and women in mask and pajama wait to be declar well enough to go home and becom a district outpati .If they becom wors instead of better , the prognosi is usual grim . Extens drug-resist diseas ( XDR TB ) requir even more toxic drug cost 25 time as much . Most XDR TB patient here die .Pham Thi Tuy , 25 , wa an unlucki woman  she caught a drug-resist strain , perhap at her job as a medic technician . Face two year of treatment , she lay hook up to an IV in Dr. Le hospit , nauseat and exhaust by the drug , watch video on her cellphon all day .I onli went to the doctor for an earach ,  she said . It didnt go away and didnt go away  and they final did a test and said it wa TB.She hope her fianc would wait two year for her to recov , she said  and then suddenli look up at Dr . Le .When I finish thi , will I still be abl to have children ? Ye ,  Dr . Le said , pat her hand .Ms. Pham eye crinkl behind her mask , suggest a sweet smile , and she gave a big thumbs-up .There are mani sign that the nation tuberculosi program here surviv on a shoestr budget .While it top laboratori have some modern equip , the 64 provinci hospit share onli 60 rapid diagnost machin , less than half the number they need , even though Vietnam pay onli $ 17,000 for each , about a tenth of the American retail price .More omin , hospit ward are danger crowd . Seven patient a room , with bed onli a foot apart , is not an uncommon sight . ( That effect mean 14 inhabit a room , as mani patient have a rel sleep on the floor or in a corridor to do nurs chore and bring food . )Window and door are kept open to blow away the bacteria that patient cough up . In chilli Hanoi , patient like Ms. Pham wear parka in bed ; in tropic Ho Chi Minh Citi , the former Saigon , they perspir in the muggi heat .Dr. Thuy Nguyen Thu , the head of the inpati unit at the Nation Lung Diseas Hospit , which treat the toughest case , said four of her staff had caught tuberculosi in the last five year . New nurs were nervou , she said .Dr. Thuy had ask for ozon air filter , better fan and safer face mask , but there are budget limitations.Geographi present the tuberculosis-control program with anoth kind of obstacl . In the Shangri La-lik valley of Son La provinc , a six-hour drive west of Hanoi , some inhabit live in villag with thatch roof and speak onli Hmong , Meo or Thai .Find and keep them in treatment is hard , said Dr. Tong Van Hieu , the director of the Quyet Thang neighborhood clinic in Son La . Some believ tuberculosi is caus by fog or dust or gold mine fume , and turn first to folk remedi .In the citi , a new problem is on the rise .Vietnam grow prosper let some patient afford privat doctor  who often ignor the offici four-drug regimen and fail to insist their patient take everi pill .Pharmacist sell antibiot without prescript , so some wealthi patient swallow onli what they feel like take . As a result , Dr. Phat Nguyen Ngoc , the head of a district hospit in Ho Chi Minh Citi , said about a third of hi patient with drug-resist diseas had gotten it becaus they had seen privat doctor first and had taken too few pill , or the wrong one .And sometim , even when compliant patient play by the rule , treatment fail , anyway .In the Hanoi Lung Diseas Hospit , Hoang Van Toan , a weather farmer look much older than hi 49 year , sat wrap in a blanket . He had taken all hi pill , he said , but tuberculosi had somehow outwit them .The room wa bare , with no televis or ani other divers . I talk to my wife ,  he said , nod at the woman sit on the temporarili empti bed opposit him .And I walk for three hour everi day at dawn ,  he ad , point out the window to a nearbi park . He wear a surgic mask as requir , he said , but that make no one nervou in Hanoi ; thousand of pass motorcyclist wear them , too .What made him saddest , he said , is that it is still too danger for hi grandchildren to visit .Ask if he would make it through the next two year , he said Ye ,  emphat .I wa a soldier ,  he ad .

As she , Andrew J.J. MacIntosh and their colleagu note in describ their research in Scientif Report , groom is known to reduc lice , but such close physic contact can also make it easi for lice to pass from one anim to anoth .Dr. Duboscq is interest in the cost and benefit of social behavior . For anim that live in social group , as macaqu and peopl do , the benefit of social life are mani , from defens against predat ( for wild monkey , and no doubt for human at some point in their histori ) to emot health and well-b ( for human , and probabl monkey , too ) .But there are neg associ with social , like the transmiss of parasit and diseas . We dont fulli understand the cost and benefit ,  Dr. Duboscq said .In thi studi , she and her colleagu estim the degre of lous infest by the number of nit pick . The more nit , they calcul , the more lice-produc nit .They compar the degre of lous infest with how central each femal wa in the social network , mean how mani other monkey were her social contact . The result wa that the femal with more social contact , and who therefor receiv more groom , had fewer lice , but onli dure the winter and summer .Dure the spring and fall , a female posit in a social network didnt seem to make ani differ .Dr. Duboscq said the reason for the season differ wasnt yet clear , but it wa possibl that the monkeys biolog affect that of the lice .Winter is the mate season for these macaqu , and they give birth in the summer . Hormon chang in the blood of the macaqu that the lice feed on could affect lous reproduct and caus a jump in lice in winter and summer , which would make groom more import .But that is onli specul so far . What is clear is that groom work well to keep the lous popul down . In thi case , the benefit of social outweigh the risk .', 'The next time you want to hug a dog , consid thi : You could be make the pooch miser , an expert say .To the averag dog lover , the animals floppi ear and pudgi paw are simpli cute .

The U.N. report identifi six key factor : G.D.P . per capita , life expect , social support , trust , generos and perceiv freedom to make life decis .Thi year , the report also examin , for the first time , the question of happi inequality. In some countri , such as the Netherland , happi level are evenli distribut . That is , most Dutch peopl are more or less equal happi , as measur in self-report survey .In other nation , particularli those in the Middl East and Latin America , happi level vari tremend . ( Unequ incom level explain some , but not all , of the variat . )Thi inequ matter , the report conclud , becaus new research suggest that peopl are significantli happier live in societi where there is less inequ of happiness.In other word , we can achiev onli so much happi if our neighbor are miser .Which rais an intrigu question : Can you redistribut happi ?Ye , you can , Dr. Helliwel said , and less pain than redistribut incom . It possibl to boost someon else happi without subtract from your own .In fact , sever studi have found that act altruist make a person happier . It one of those win-win game that everyon is look for ,  Dr. Helliwel said .The U.N. report is good news for Bhutan , the nation where happi is most evenli distribut . No great surpris there : The tini Himalayan nation single-handedli spark interest in global bliss with it well public measur of Gross Nation Happi .And while the country prime minist recent said he plan to dial back thi approach , the seed have been export and plant around the world and now they are grow vigor ,  Dr. Helliwel said .The U.K. and Franc are both activ pursu way to translat happi data into public polici . Last month , the Unit Arab Emir appoint a minist of happi , the first such posit in the Middl East , part of an effort to improv it well-b rank ( current a not terribl 28th ) .Thi fascin with the scorecard rankl some happi research , but not Dr. Helliwel , who view them as a kind of loss leader .It get peopl in the store , and onc theyr in the store they becom interest in ask , Well , what make for better live ?   he said .', 'Juan F. Masello never intend to studi wild parrot . Twenti year ago , as a graduat student visit the northernmost provinc of Patagonia in Argentina , he plan to write hi dissert on coloni format among seabird .But when he ask around for flock of , say , cormor or storm petrel , a park warden told him he wa out of luck .He said , Thi is the onli part of Patagonia with no seabird coloni ,  recal Dr. Masello , a princip investig in anim ecolog and systemat at Justu Liebig Univers in Germani . Might the young scientist be interest in see a larg coloni of parrot instead ?The sight that greet Dr. Masello wa amazing and incred ,  he said . It wa almost beyond words.On a 160-foot-high sandston cliff that stretch some seven mile along the Atlant coast , ten of thousand of pair of burrow parrot had use their power bill to dig hole  their nest  deep into the rock face .And when breed season began not long afterward , the sky around the cliff erupt into a raucou carniv of parrot : 150,000 crow-siz , polychrom aeronaut with oliv backsid , turquois wing , white epaulet and bright red belli patch ring in gold . Dr. Masello wa hook .Today , Dr. Masello hand are cover with bite scar . He ha had four oper to repair a broken knee , a broken nose  the littl accid you get from work with parrot ,  he said . Still , he ha no regret .Their astonish beauti and intellig ,  Dr. Masello said , are inspirational.Dr. Masello is one of a small but unabashedli enthusiast circl of research who studi Psittaciform , the avian order that includ parrot , parakeet , macaw and cockatoo . For all their visual splash and cartoon familiar , parrot have long been given scientif short shrift in favor of more amen subject like , say , zebra finch or blue tit .But through a mix of rug and sometim riski field work , laboratori studi and a willing to shrug off the frequent loss of expens track equip , research are gain insight into the live , mind and startl appetit of parrot .No , Polli doesnt want your Triscuit .

Just as with peopl , young parrot can easili master multipl dialect while their elder cant or wont bother to do likewis .A recent DNA analysi show that parrot were close relat to falcon , a find that dovetail with field studi of parrots often merciless dietari habit .While falcon are predat in the convent sens , hunt and devour other anim , parrot turn out to be no less bloodthirsti in their approach to feast on plant . Forget about symbiosi or some happi tit-for-tat between flora and thi particular fauna .Parrot pooh-pooh the fruit pulp and home in on the seed , crush the case to extract the plant embryo and the cach of fat and protein intend to help those embryo germin . A parrot is a plant carnivor ,  Dr. Wright said . It destroy the seed . It goe right in through the fruit and eat the plant baby.Or the entir herbac brood . Research have found that when a flock of parrot alight on a fruit tree , a verit seed massacr can ensu .In one studi of canary-wing parakeet forag on the seed of shaving-brush tree in the Cerrado tropic savanna of central Brazil , scientist determin that the bird destroy 66 percent to 100 percent of each tree fruit in a matter of day . Not a singl whole seed could be found on the ground .The psittacin are a midsiz club of about 360 speci , rang in size from the pygmi parrot of New Guinea , which are smaller than hous sparrow , to the bulki , flightless kakapo of New Zealand , which can weigh up to nine pound .Most parrot live in the tropic or subtrop , where a mix of habitat loss and the depred of the intern pet trade now threaten a third of all speci with extinct , Dr. Masello said .At the same time , some parrot speci are prove flexibl to the point of invas .Monk parakeet from South America are do nice in New York Citi ,  said Leo Joseph , a parrot expert and director of the Australian Nation Wildlif Collect in Canberra . Peach-fac lovebird from Africa are well-establish in Arizona.Resid of Lo Angel Counti may spot enclav of more than a dozen differ feral parrot , includ lilac-crown Amazon , rose-ring parakeet , macaw and cockatiel . Whi some parrot thrive in anthropocentr landscap while other are on the cusp of oblivion ha yet to be determin .Research propos that mani of the parrot signatur trait evolv to meet the challeng of seed predat and exploit a resourc that plant do everyth in their power to defend .The parrot muscular jaw and huge bill  special hing to allow top and bottom to move independ , up and down and from side to side  can crack open even the toughest and woodiest shell . The curv point of the bill act rather like lobster pick , ideal for scoop out seed meat .Parrot can similarli clip apart leg band , satellit holster and other animal-track devic , which is one reason most research have avoid them .Anoth demand of granivori , or seed predat , is the power to withstand the mani defens chemic that plant pack into their genet hope chest . Research have late gather evid that a drive to detoxifi could explain whi parrot often converg on clay flat and start nibbl at the ground .In laboratori experi at the Univers of California , Davi , scientist fed orange-wing parrot small dose of quinidin , a potenti toxic alkaloid , and follow with what they call a chaser of Peruvian clay . The research found that the clay serv a doubli salubri purpos , first by directli bind to the poison and help to flush it from the bodi , and then by stimul the product of a mucu shield in the gut .Paradox , scientist said , the pursuit of toxic prey may be link to the parrot except longev . The difficult diet probabl select for a tough constitut , with top-flight immun and DNA repair system , and tough thing tend to last .In addit , the ingest toxin may well have an antimicrobi , anti-parasit effect , help parrot to fend off diseas .Howev they manag , parrot can live a half centuri or longer : the record-hold among Moluccan cockatoo , for exampl , is 92 , and a veri lucki kakapo might make it to 120 .Yet seed hunting greatest evolutionari effect on parrothood may well have been psychosoci , transform the bird into braini schmoozer .Fruit tree are a patchi and unpredict resourc , and parrot often fli mani mile a day in quest of food . Under such circumst , search in group turn out to be more effici than solitari hunt , especi when group member can trade tip on promis lead .That can mean the develop of a social system , as well as the neurolog capac to share inform ,  Dr. Joseph said . The vocal capac , too : parrot call to one anoth continu , squawkishli , over long distanc and short .They are commun to each other all the time ,  Dr. Masello said . Everi day , after work in the coloni and climb up the cliff , Im much more tire from the nois than from the climbing.The call may be as much about assert group ident as exchang hunt tip . Seek to understand whi the yellow-nap Amazon in northern Costa Rica had a differ call from those live 18 mile to the south , Dr. Wright team tri move sever parrot from one site to the other .The youngest parrot quickli master the dialect of it new home and began flock with the local . The older transplant , howev , fail to becom adept bilingualist and never quit fit in . Instead , they associ with each other .They form a littl immigr enclav ,  Dr. Wright said , ad , Vocal similar is veri import for maintain social relationship ,  in parrot as in human .Dr. Wright said that captiv parrots renown talent for promiscu vocal mimicri  of human speech , a multipart car alarm , a cat meow  is probabl a byproduct of an innat desir to parrot it own kind .It extrem rare to find mimicri of other speci in wild parrot ,  he said . He also suggest that the abil of some parrot in captiv to move to a music beat may be an offshoot of vocal mimicri , a gener motor pattern gear toward synchroni play out in bodi or voic .The most celebr danc parrot is Snowbal , a sulfur-crest cockatoo with a trademark name whose YouTub danc perform to Queen , Michael Jackson and the Backstreet Boy have been view some 15 million time .Research are still get a bead on parrot intellig , and they are repeatedli surpris by each new display of it .Dr. Pepperberg and her collabor have shown that African grey parrot have except number skill : Alex could deduc the proper order of number up to 8 , add three small number togeth and even had a zerolik concept  skill equival to those of a four-and-a-half-year-old child ,  Dr. Pepperberg said .Dr. Auersperg and her co-work have found that Goffin cockatoo are more gear toward solv technic task .

Period cicada popul  call brood  are identifi by Roman numer .We think of them as the Methuselah of the insect world ,  said Gregori Hoover , an ornament entomologist at Pennsylvania State Univers .Thi particular gener of insect last emerg in 1999 ( a year fill with anxieti about a differ kind of bug , the computer-bas Y2K ) .The period cicada is nativ to North America and exist nowher els in the world , Mr. Hoover said . Research have been track the brood for more than 100 year . In the late 1800 , American entomologist creat the first good map of the insects rang . Reli on a form of crowdsourc , they sent circular to postmast in the Eastern Unit State each year and record their respons .The insect are about one and a half inch long , with red eye and orang vein in their wing . They are smaller than the dog-day cicada , which are usual heard in late summer .The period cicada  the male in particular  will be the noisiest . Individu , a cicada song sound like a tini maraca shaken at high speed that then fade into a nois resembl an electr buzz .In a swarm , the cicada high-pitch hum can reach 85 decibel , or slightli louder than a pass diesel train . Male begin their sing shortli after they emerg , while the femal are mostli silent , Mr. Hoover said .The sound come from their tymbal , the corrug exoskeleton on their torso that they contract and releas .The insect cover their own hear organ to avoid do damag . As the websit Cicada Mania note : A cicada appli directli to the ear ( do not do that ) get in the rang of a loud rock concert and ambul siren , which will caus hear damag . Again , do not put cicada in or around your ear , and avoid see Metallica live in concert.There are mani brood of period cicada , with differ geograph rang and life cycl . In 2013 , the arriv of Brood II wa most evid in place like Staten Island and part of the Hudson Valley .Brood V popul will number in the billion , but the distinct of Big Brood goe to Brood X , which saw cicada in more than a dozen state in 2004 , Mr. Hoover said .In gener , develop in forest area that remov tree , which are the habitat for period cicada , ha drastic reduc their popul , he said .Although adult cicada are harmless to peopl , they can caus some damag to shade and fruit tree , Mr. Hoover said . They can also caus a mess and discomfort for human .In addit to the eeri nois cicada emit , they leav behind case that can coat deck and patio , prompt some homeown in the past to get power washer to remov them . If you have a phobia about insect , thi will be a time of high anxieti . Dog owner have discov the undigest remnant of the insect from the upset stomach of their pet .But for some other anim , such as bird and fish , the emerg of the period cicada mean a bumper crop of food . Trout , bass and carp will liter gorg themselves on the adult insect , Mr. Hoover said .The lead-up to cicadas emerg is a prolong , low-key process . Cicada nymph spend 17 year underground , where they await an undetermin signal for emerg ,  Mr. Hoover said .A combin of soil temperatur reach 64 degre and light rain seem to trigger their ascens , he said . The nymph climb tree and within an hour , they shed their skin and becom adult .Ten day later , the mate begin .

Robinson nuclear power plant , about 70 mile from Columbia , S.C. , ha been produc electr with few interrupt sinc the Nixon administr . But as of now , it fate is clear : The plant will have to shut down by 2030 , when it will be six decad old .The Robinson reactor is one of the oldest still oper in the Unit State , but other are get on in year . From 2029 to 2035 , three dozen of the nation 99 reactor , repres more than a third of the industry gener capac , will face closur as their oper licens expir .Ani shutdown would be anoth blow to nuclear energi , which provid 19 percent of the nation electr but ha struggl in recent year to compet against subsid solar and wind power and plant that burn low-pric natur ga . Industri advoc say that by remov sourc of clean electr  a nuclear reaction produc no carbon dioxid or other greenhous gase  the close could affect the government abil to fulfil it pledg , made at the Pari climat talk last year , to reduc emiss .And to continu to meet the nation electr load , new gener capac will have to be built to replac ani that is lost .Some of those plant are go to be retir ,  said Stephen E. Kuczynski , the chief execut of Southern Company nuclear subsidiari . Which mean wer go to need to meet thi load with something.Given the sometim glacial pace of design , licens and construct in the nuclear industri , the 2030 are not far-off . Plant oper may be abl to buy time by seek licens extens for anoth 20 year from the Nuclear Regulatori Commiss , or by build more larg reactor like four that are under construct .The industri and the Depart of Energi are also pin their hope on the develop of less convent reactor design that are meant to be safer and cheaper to build and oper . Yet it is unclear whether ani new design could reach the market in time to make a dent in the gener capac lost as plant are close .Some in the industri are bullish , includ Southern , which announc in Januari that it would receiv up to $ 40 million from the Depart of Energi to develop an advanc reactor that use molten salt as a coolant instead of water , which all current design use .Our target is  can we realli move the process forward and have a commerci option by 2030 ?  Mr. Kuczynski said . To do that , he and other say , the pace of the design process , and of the Nuclear Regulatori Commission review process , need to be sped up .But some say the shorten timet are unrealist , given safeti and other concern and the need to test new design befor seek approv from the commiss .It a 25-year process , no matter what ,  said Michael McGough , the chief commerci offic of NuScal Power , which is the furthest along among compani work on less convent reactor . NuScale design , call a small modular reactor , use water as a coolant , but the unit are far smaller than current reactor and have advanc safeti featur . They could be built larg in a factori , save money , and up to 12 of them could be instal at one site .Mr. McGough know all about long timet ; NuScale design ha been under develop sinc 2000 . It ha line up a potenti first custom , Utah Associ Municip Power System , or Uamp , which oper in the Intermountain West , and hope to have 12 of the small reactor oper at a site in Idaho by the mid-2020 . It improb to me that you will see ani new design develop or licens in a much shorter time frame than the kind wer on ,  Mr. McGough said .NuScal ha been test it design for 13 year , use a nonnuclear prototyp . Later thi year , it plan to submit an 11,000-page applic to the N.R.C . to have it design certifi . The commiss then ha up to 40 month to review the applic .The certif process , and a later applic by Uamp for a construct and oper licens , could be delay if the N.R.C . ask for more inform . But even if all goe smoothli , the plant will produc onli about half the electr of mani exist reactor . About 50 of these 12-reactor plant would be need to replac the gener capac that could be lost by 2035 .Mani in the industri hope that extend the licens of exist reactor will forestal at least some close . Nuclear plant were origin licens for 40 year , but almost all have sought and receiv 20-year extens .The regulatori commiss ha begun research what would be requir to extend a plant life to 80 year . Wer ask veri basic question , like how long can a reactor vessel remain accept sinc it be bombard by neutron ,  said Scott Burnel , a spokesman . The inform we have at thi point is that those are issu that are not showstoppers.So far one oper ha announc plan to seek such an extens , for two reactor set to close in the earli 2030 , but an applic and possibl approv are still year away . Duke Energi , owner of the Robinson plant in South Carolina , said it wa evalu whether to pursu an extens .Given the rel poor econom of nuclear power , howev , even if a plant could be licens to oper up to 80 year , the question remain whether it would be financi worthwhil for it to do so , especi if expens work is requir . Skeptic cite two American plant that have been close for econom reason sinc 2012 , after their licens were extend to 60 year .Similar econom uncertainti surround the latest gener of reactor , the Westinghous AP1000 , a design that is similar in mani respect to exist unit but ha safeti improv and cost-sav featur . Four of these are be built in the Unit State , and there have been lengthi construct delay and balloon cost .But Mr. Kuczynski of Southern , which is build two of the reactor in Georgia , said the industri wa learn from experi , which would lower the cost of subsequ plant . Wer go to get through the first of a kind ,  he said , and ani futur order are go to be just terrif bargains.Other are not so sure the industri will rush to build more . What eventu happen with the four AP1000 will be veri import ,  said Matthew McKinzi , a senior scientist with the Natur Resourc Defens Council . If the econom of extend the lifetim of a plant to 80 year are poor , then what doe that say about the econom of a new plant ? Critic of nuclear power say that novel design like molten salt reactor rais new issu , especi regard safeti , that will requir much time to evalu .A regul cant accept paper studi say that a reactor is supersaf ,  said Edwin Lyman of the Union of Concern Scientist . They need document , experiment data.The industri and Depart of Energi have thi fantasi that you can have some gener design-neutr licens process ,  he ad .But Ray Rothrock , a ventur capitalist who ha invest in two compani work on advanc design , said time wa run out to improv the process .Wev got probabl a five- to 10-year window ,  he said . If we dont get thi fix in the next presidenti administr or so , wev miss it.', 'Is empathi an essenti virtu for a presidenti candid ?The convent wisdom is that a good candid must be abl to feel your pain . Bill Clinton wa hail by pundit as a virtuoso of empathi , supposedli ride that qualiti to triumph over Georg H.W . Bush , who wa so often said to be short of empathi that he felt compel to tell an audienc , Messag : I care.Al Gore defeat in 2000 wa blame , in part , on hi emot frigid , and Mitt Romney in 2012 on the empathi gap with Barack Obama .But there are a coupl of problem with the convent wisdom . To begin with , it not clear that empathi actual matter much to voter .In the Republican primari , Donald J. Trump , who brag that he so rich he feel no pain at all , ha trounc Senat Marco Rubio of Florida , who emphas hi family financi struggl , and Gov . John Kasich of Ohio , known for comfort ralli attende with hug .Some polit scientist say that empathi is not a crucial factor in presidenti race , note that person trait dont correl well with the result on Elect Day . A candid often win despit an oppon who receiv higher mark in poll ask how much each care about the need and problem of peopl like you.The voters indiffer could reflect anoth problem with convent wisdom : Empathi may not be such a great qualiti in a leader . Although the capac to sympath with others suffer is wide hail as an essenti virtu  Mr. Obama ha said the world is suffer from an empathi deficit  there a downsid that ha inspir a live debat among social psychologist .The most promin critic is Paul Bloom , a professor of psycholog at Yale , who gave a talk at thi year meet of the Societi for Person and Social Psycholog titl Doe Empathi Make Us Immor ?  He readili acknowledg that empathi can inspir altruism  that onc you broaden your ambit of concern and empath with the plight of other ,  in Mr. Obama word , it becom harder not to act , harder not to help.But whom do you end up help ? Often the wrong peopl , Dr. Bloom say , becaus empathi is bias and parochi . It favor vulner children and anim , and discrimin against unattract peopl . Your more like to sympath with someon in your social group rather than an outsid , especi one who look differ .Empathi is also innumer , Dr. Bloom note , which is whi you may care more about one girl stuck in a well than thousand of war refuge or million of peopl who will be affect by climat chang .Moreov , empathi can be manipul to inspir aggress . In one experi , when peopl were induc to empath with the person problem of one player in a game , they becam more will to punish the player oppon , even though the oppon had noth to do with those person problem .In hi current research , Dr. Bloom and a colleagu are find that the more empath peopl feel toward victim of terror in the Middl East , the more they favor take militari action .If I want to do terribl thing to a group , one tried-and-tru way is to arous empathi for victim of that group ,  Dr. Bloom said in an interview . Often the argument for war is root in empathi for victim of the enemy.Dr. Bloom conclud that empathi is overr as a guid for person moral or public leadership . Sob stori are not a good way to make public polici ,  he said . The best leader have a certain enlighten aloofness.They recogn the suffer of victim of terrorist , but they also recogn that go to war will creat futur victim . They make polici by take into account number and cost-benefit analys . They use ration mean to achiev good ends.Other research , though , argu that empathi isnt as irrat as it seem . They see it as not just a knee-jerk reflex but as someth we can control . Our empathi declin as the number of victim increas , an effect call compass collapse. But mayb that becaus we realiz we cant do anyth meaning to help the larger group .Empathi can often be costli , entail outlay of materi resourc , emot effort and physic risk ,  said Daryl Cameron , a psychologist at the Univers of Iowa . If peopl recogn these cost , either conscious or not , they may strateg regul their empathi away to avoid the costs.To test thi theori of motiv empathi ,  Dr. Cameron and a colleagu compar people reaction to stori about children suffer in Darfur . When peopl didnt expect to be ask for a donat , they respond more strongli to a stori about a group of children than to a stori about a singl child . But if they expect to be hit up for a donat , then their compass for the larger group collaps , appar becaus theyd regul their empathi to protect themselv .In other experi , psychologist at Stanford have found that peopl can increas their empathi , too . When nudg to believ they can increas their empathi , they becom more sympathet toward peopl with differ background and belief .Thi type of empathi doesnt alway come natur ,  said Jamil Zaki , a psychologist at Stanford . It work . But choos empathi afford us opportun to build more divers and power social connect , and take control of our emot lives.Dr. Bloom , the empathi critic , agre that thi emot can be goos to some degre , but he say we are still better off reli on the less emot strategi describ in 1759 by Adam Smith in The Theori of Moral Sentiments. Smith note that fellow-feel ,  hi term for empathi , wa a power yet limit emot : An Englishman , he suggest , would lose more sleep worri about the loss of a finger than about the death of 100 million foreign in an earthquak .How , Smith ask , could thi selfish impuls be overridden ?It is not that feebl spark of benevol which Natur ha light up in the human heart , that is thu capabl of counteract the strongest impuls of self-lov ,  Smith wrote . It is a stronger power , a more forcibl motiv , which exert itself upon such occas .It is reason , principl , conscienc , the inhabit of the breast , the man within , the great judg and arbit of our conduct.That may sound like an overli optimist view of human natur , especi thi elect year .

Are there ani new treatment in the pipelin for age-rel macular degener ?A . Current treatment for the so-cal wet form of macular degener , involv inject insid the eye , are alreadi veri effective compar with laser treatment , which were use befor intravitr inject , said Dr. Ronald C.

A major hurdl now involv the frequenc and cost of the need treatment .Onc the drug is insid the eye , the effect wear off and a new inject is need , Dr. Gentil said . The shot are also less effect in some patient . Even when they work well , some peopl need a shot as often as everi four week , while some can wait two or three month . If both eye are affect and the period of effect is short , doctor visit can be veri frequent , so drug that last longer in the eyebal are be pursu .Research are work on slow-releas medic as well as a deliveri system that act like a tini pump in the eye , with a tank that can be refil everi six month .There is also a new drug target : a substanc call platelet-deriv growth factor that caus abnorm vessel growth as well . Combin drug treatment may be more effect against macular degener , Dr. Gentil said .The so-cal dri form of macular degener , which often underli the wet form , is harder to fight , he said , and although advanc are be made , current antioxid treatment with vitamin and miner do not improv vision ; they just prevent it from worsen .There ha been a lot of hype on use stem cell ,  Dr. Gentil said , but ad that more research wa need .

And while mani peopl enjoy the T-shirt weather , it made Clair E. Rutledg , a research with Connecticut Agricultur Experi Station , more concern about what next season may hold .Begin in April , she will head to Wharton Brook and other state land , set trap for the southern pine beetl and check them weekli through midsumm .The beetl , which can kill thousand of tree in epidem attack , had never been found beyond the pitch pine forest of the American South , becaus the winter were too cold . But they have migrat to New Jersey , where they have destroy more than 30,000 acr of forest sinc 2002 . And the warmer winter have now beckon them to New England .Alarm scientist first discov the beetl last year along a front stretch more than 200 mile , from central Long Island to Cape Cod and Martha Vineyard , a region long thought to be far too frigid for these tini beetl , bare differ in size and color from a chocol sprinkl .When I heard they caught a live beetl in Massachusett ,  Dr. Rutledg said , that realli freak me out.Now that the beetl are in New England , they are probabl there to stay , state and environment offici said . And if there is a sever outbreak , the region could lose much of it pitch pine forest . Mani of the forest are alreadi unhealthi , a result of overcrowd , make them especi suscept to the pine beetle attack  bore through bark , lay egg and spread a crippl fungu  and mani state forestri divis do not have the resourc to combat them .Scientist are concern that the beetl could destroy the remain tract of the pitch pine forest , an ecosystem that onc carpet the Eastern Seaboard but now exist mostli in pocket  the Cape Cod Nation Seashor , the Albani Pine Bush Preserv and smaller forest  and is home to more than a dozen endang speci , such as the tiger beetl and sever type of butterfli .I dont think peopl have a strong understand of how at risk these forest are ,  said Kevin J. Dodd , a scientist who run the southern pine beetl respons in the Northeast for the Unit State Forest Servic .An invas in New England could mean a repeat of what happen in New Jersey and on Long Island , where state agenc were caught off guard , offici say .Wer still scratch our head and ask whi we didnt find thi sooner on Long Island , said Robert Davi , New York state forest . By the time they had discov the infest , he said , it had balloon to 10,000 acr . ( They have sinc contain it to about 8,000 acr . )State environment offici and feder forest warn Connecticut that the plagu could be head their way toward the end of 2014 , and soon after , they found infest tree in about 20 place across the state . So last spring in much of New England and New York , forest and state offici set trap to determin if there were more beetl . And there they were , in trap in Bear Mountain State Park in New York ; southern Connecticut ; Rhode Island ; central Massachusett ; and in Cape Cod , Plymouth and Martha Vineyard , Mass .Some scientist see the beetles march north as anoth sign that climat chang is disrupt the environ , and not just in way that damag ecosystem . Heat-lov creatur like tick and mosquito are expand their rang , too , carri ill like Lyme diseas to Canada and dengu fever to part of the Unit State .And the environment cost are steep , too . For all the damag wrought by the southern pine beetl , the mountain pine beetl ha exact a far greater toll , ravag pine forest across the western Unit State and Canada , destroy ten of million of acr in place and altitud onc thought beyond their reach .Accord to Matthew P. Ayr , a Dartmouth Colleg biologist who studi the southern pine beetl , the warm of winter coldest night is the primari caus of their spread . Most beetl die if temperatur fall to around minu 8 degre Fahrenheit . And while thi winter had an unusu cold snap , the low temperatur did not last long enough to wipe out the beetl , Dr. Rutledg said .Mr. Davi said , We were still hear about beetl fli on Christma Day , and that not a good thing.Dr. Dodd and other say that mani longstand practic unintent damag the forest . They were larg left to themselv , result in overcrowd stand , where tree had to compet for sunlight and nutrient . In crowd forest , beetl attack can spread more easili , and the insect overwhelm a tree defens by lay egg that , onc theyv hatch , hijack the tree circulatori system . They also carri a fungu that clog the tree waterway .With thi one-two punch , beetl can wipe out thousand of tree in a season , Dr. Rutledg said . Natur fire , for all the damag they caus , do thin forest and lead to regrowth , but state have work quickli to extinguish them .Tree have some defens mechan  they releas resin , which harden into littl yellow cluster on the bark ( commonli refer to as popcorn ) to fill the hole made by beetl and kill them  but they do not alway work .The pine beetl is no longer consid a big threat in the South becaus the forest are healthi , a result of decad of thin effort , Dr. Ayr said , aid by the region larg lumber market , where salvag pine can be sold to mill .By contrast , there is not alway a market for the tree in much of the Northeast .Thi spring , scientist and state offici will set more trap in New England and New York . Depend on what they find , they may conduct aerial survey to see if ani tree are in distress . When the tree are in troubl , their needl turn from green to yellow and red , an effect that can be seen best from abov .Dr. Ayr said that if precaut were not taken , a widespread invas could leav onli a few pitch pine in the region .He also said he could forese the beetl possibl reach the Great Lake state and Canadian provinc , which are heavili forest with red and jack pine and could be vulner . From there , they could infiltr much of Canada , spread west to meet the mountain pine beetl that have been move east into Alberta and Saskatchewan , leav a ring of dead forest around the contin .It an exampl of someth that happen all over the world ,  Dr. Ayr said . It old pest in new place , and with that come a whole new set of challenges.', 'The ancestor of modern human interbr with Neanderth and anoth extinct line of human known as the Denisovan at least four time in the cours of prehistori , accord to an analysi of global genom publish Thursday in the journal Scienc .The interbreed may have given modern human gene that bolster immun to pathogen , the author conclud .Thi is yet anoth genet nail in the coffin of our oversimplist model of human evolut ,  said Carl Lalueza-Fox , a research scientist at the Institut of Evolutionari Biolog in Barcelona , Spain , who wa not involv in the studi .The new studi expand on a seri of find in recent year show that the ancestor of modern human onc share the planet with a surpris number of near rel  lineag like the Neanderth and Denisovan that becam extinct ten of thousand of year ago .Befor disappear , howev , they interbr with our forebear on at least sever occas . Today , we carri DNA from these encount .The first clue to ancient interbreed surfac in 2010 , when scientist discov that some modern human  mostli European  carri DNA that match materi recov from Neanderth fossil .Later studi show that the forebear of modern human first encount Neanderth after expand out of Africa more than 50,000 year ago .But the Neanderth were not the onli extinct human that our own ancestor found . A finger bone discov in a Siberian cave , call Denisova , yield DNA from yet anoth group of human .Research later indic that all three group  modern human , Neanderth and Denisovan  share a common ancestor who live roughli 600,000 year ago . And , perhap no surpris , some ancestor of modern human also interbr with Denisovan .Some of their DNA ha surviv in peopl in Melanesia , a region of the Pacif that includ New Guinea and the island around it .Those initi discoveri left major question unansw , such as how often our ancestor interbr with Neanderth and Denisovan . Scientist have develop new way to studi the DNA of live peopl to tackl these mysteri .Joshua M. Akey , a geneticist at the Univers of Washington , and hi colleagu analyz a databas of 1,488 genom from peopl around the world . The scientist ad 35 genom from peopl in New Britain and other Melanesian island in an effort to learn more about Denisovan in particular .The research found that all of the non-African in their studi had Neanderth DNA , while the African had veri littl or none . That find support previou studi .But when Dr. Akey and hi colleagu compar DNA from modern European , East Asian and Melanesian , they found that each popul carri it own distinct mix of Neanderth gene .The best explan for these pattern , the scientist conclud , wa that the ancestor of modern human acquir Neanderth DNA on three occas .The first encount happen when the common ancestor of all non-African interbr with Neanderth .The second occur among the ancestor of East Asian and European , after the ancestor of Melanesian split off . Later , the ancestor of East Asian  but not European  interbr a third time with Neanderth .Earlier studi had hint at the possibl that the forebear of modern human had multipl encount with Neanderth , but hard data had been lack .A lot of peopl have been argu for that , but now theyr realli provid the evid for it ,  said Rasmu Nielsen , a geneticist at the Univers of California , Berkeley , who wa not involv in the new studi .The Melanesian took a differ cours . After a singl interbreed with Neanderth , Dr. Akey found , their ancestor went on to interbre just onc with Denisovan as well .Where that encount could have taken place remain an enigma . The onli place Denisovan remain have been found is Siberia , a long way from New Guinea .It is possibl that Denisovan rang down to Southeast Asia , Dr. Akey said , cross path with modern human who later settl in Melanesia .Dr. Akey and hi colleagu also identifi some region of Neanderth and Denisovan DNA that becam more common in modern human as gener pass , suggest that they provid some kind of a surviv advantag .Mani of the region contain immun system gene , Dr. Akey note .A modern human are spread out across the world , theyr encount pathogen they havent experienc befor ,  he said . Neanderth and Denisovan may have had gene that were adapt to fight those enemi .Mayb they realli help us surviv and thrive in these new environ ,  he said .Dr. Akey and hi colleagu found that Neanderth and Denisovan DNA wa glaringli absent from four region of the modern human genom .That absenc may signal that these stretch of the genom are instrument in make modern human uniqu . Intriguingli , one of those region includ a gene call FOXP2 , which is involv in speech .Scientist suspect that Neanderth and Denisovan were not the onli extinct race our ancestor interbr with .PingHsun Hsieh , a biologist at the Univers of Arizona , and hi colleagu report last month that the genom of African pygmi contain piec of DNA that came from an unknown sourc within the last 30,000 year .Dr. Akey and hi colleagu are now follow up with an analysi of African popul .

The state ha design the monster as it offici fossil .Some thought the 300-million-year-old creatur wa a mollusk , like a snail . Other assum it wa an arthropod like an insect or crab . And other believ it wa some sort of worm .Now , a team of research from Yale Univers say they have figur out the monster ident : It a vertebr most close relat to the lamprey , an underwat bloodsuck .They publish their find on Wednesday in Natur .To come to their conclus , team member first pore over 1,200 Tulli monster specimen from museum . They close examin the creature featur , like it torpedo-shap bodi and triangular tail , the probosci that look like an elephant trunk with sharp teeth , and the eye on the side of it head , which resembl a hammerhead , but are similar to eye stalk found in crab and insect .The frustrat thing is that these morpholog featur are not typic of ani group ,  said Victoria McCoy , a paleontologist and lead author on the paper . But they do not rule out ani group veri easily.The clue that led them to close the cold case wa a lightli color structur scientist had previous identifi as the creature gut . Onli it wasnt a gut .We discov that thi featur wa the notochord , the primit backbon ,  said Dr. McCoy .Most gut in the fossil record are dark and appear three-dimension . But the Tulli monster structur wa light and appear two-dimension .It didnt make sens to us that there would be thi one anim that would fossil it gut complet differ ,  she said .After find that the creatur had a primit backbon , they could classifi it as a chordat , which is a famili of speci that includ all vertebr .

By further examin the notochord , the fossil sleuth notic that the structur curv down as it went through the creature tail .In anim like shark , the notochord curv up into the top fin of the tail , and in some fish it goe through the middl of the tail . But in lamprey the notochord curv down .There wa no big Aha !  moment that point to the lamprey . But put togeth , the strongest evid wa that it could be a lamprey ,  Dr. McCoy said .

Global , plant respir contribut six time as much carbon dioxid to the atmospher as fossil fuel emiss , much of which is reabsorb by plant , the ocean and other element of natur . Until now , most scientist have thought that a warm planet would caus plant to releas more carbon dioxid into the atmospher , which in turn would caus more warm .But in a studi publish Wednesday in Natur , scientist show that plant were abl to adapt their respir to increas in temperatur over long period of time , releas onli 5 percent more carbon dioxid than they did under normal condit .Base on measur of short-term temperatur respons in thi studi and other , the scientist expect that the plant would increas their respir by nearli five time that much .At two forest-research site in Minnesota , scientist test how the respir rate of 10 differ speci of tree  from boreal and temper forest  were affect by increas in temperatur over a period of three to five year , use heat cabl to warm some of the tree .The tree were monitor in two condit : ambient , and about 6 degre warmer than that .To demonstr how the plant adapt to long-term temperatur increas , the scientist compar three thing : how much carbon dioxid the tree releas in ambient condit ; how much the tree releas in the warmer condit ; and how much carbon dioxid the tree releas when they were expos to the warmer temperatur for a short period of time ( minut or hour ) .When the scientist compar the result , they found that the tree that were acclim to the warmer temperatur increas their carbon dioxid releas by a much smaller amount than the tree that were onli expos to a short-term temperatur increas of the same magnitud .Boreal and temper forest account for a third of the world forest area , and if they adapt their respir rate in the way thi studi suggest , the forest , the planet lung , can breath easi .', 'On Feb. 29 , Carol Greider of John Hopkin Univers becam the third Nobel Prize laureat biologist in a month to do someth long consid taboo among biomed research : She post a report of her recent discoveri to a publicli access websit , bioRxiv , befor submit it to a scholarli journal to review for official public .It wa a small act of inform age defianc , and perhap also a bit of a throwback , somewhat analog to Stephen King 2000 self-publish an e-book or Radiohead 2007 releas of a download-onli record without a label . To commemor it , she tweet the website confirm under the hashtag # ASAPbio , a newli coin ralli cri of a cadr of biologist who say they want to speed scienc by make a key chang in the way it is publish .Such post are known as preprints to signifi their early-stag statu , and the 2,048 deposit on three-year-old bioRxiv over the last year repres a bare detect fraction of the million or so research paper publish annual in tradit biomed journal .But after sever dozen biologist vow to ralli around preprint at an ASAPbio meet last month , the site ha had a small surg , and not just from scientist whose august statur protect them from risk . On Twitter , preprint insurg are celebr one another post and jockey for revolutionari credibl . ( These two are from a molecular biologist at the Univers of California , Berkeley and a Cold Spring Harbor neuroscientist . )For most of the histori of organ scientif research , the limit of technolog made print journal the chief mean of dissemin scientif result . But some # ASAPbio advoc argu that sinc the rise of the Internet , biologist have been abdic their duti to the public  which pay for most academ research  by not share result as quickli and openli as possibl . As Harold Varmu , anoth Nobel Prize recipi and former director of the Nation Institut of Health put it in a wide tweet talk at the confer :Unlik physicist , for whom preprint becam a default method of commun discoveri in the 1990 , biomed research typic wait more than six month to dissemin their work while they submit it  on an exclus basi  to the most prestigi journal they think might accept it for public . If , as is often the case , it is reject , they tri anoth journal . As a result , it can sometim take year to publish a paper , which is then typic avail for a time onli to colleagu at major academ institut whose librari pay for subscript . And becaus scienc is in mani way a relay , with one scientist build on the publish work of anoth , the commun delay almost certainli slow scientif progress .Research say they particip in the process in larg part becaus the imprimatur of highli select journal like Scienc , Natur and Cell ha come to be view as a proxi for qualiti scienc . Like a degre from certain colleg , a studi in an elit journal can be a passport to job , fund and promot .While sever influenti journal , includ Scienc and Natur , have a state polici of treat preprint on an equal foot with paper that have not been post elsewher , few biologist have chosen an option they fear will handicap alreadi slim prospect of accept . Some journal have a polici of not consid preprint . And other , like Cell , say prospect author who wish to post preprint must ask first .Ann Carpent , a comput biologist affili with the Broad Institut of M.I.T . and Harvard said that she think that mani young scientist prefer stick with high-profil journal becaus the altern just seem to too riski .Beyond career concern , mani scientist say scienc as a whole benefit from the kind of peer review that ha been a fixtur of scientif publish , in which journal editor ask other scientist in a field to flag obviou error and assess the import of a work befor public . Yet anoth Nobel Prize laureat , Randi Schekman , a cell biologist at the Univers of California , Berkeley , ha argu for it import even while support preprint .But mani biologist have begun to chafe at a system that one neuroscientist recent compar to a bug on it back tri to flip itself over while endlessli rotat a piec of what appear to be Styrofoam .The delay prevent scientist from show off their most recent work to prospect employ or benefactor . They have also , some research say , begun to look faintli absurd against the gener expect for speed and open in the not-so-new digit age . With the rapid spread of the Zika viru , for instanc , sever journal sign a statement promis that scientist would not be penal for immedi releas their find , given the potenti benefit for public health , in turn prompt some scientist to ask , whi draw the line at Zika ?Then there is the research in Kazakhstan who ha becom a kind of scienc cult hero by pirat everi academ paper for which journal requir payment and make them avail on a free site call Sci-Hub . Though few think that is a long-term solut , one websit ha call her the Robin Hood of Science.And mani # ASAPbio support retweet John Hawk , a paleoanthropologist from the Univers of Wisconsin , who found himself recent at an African univers where a paper on African genom wa unavail becaus it could not pay the fee for the journal where it wa publish , and no preprint wa avail . He express hi frustrat with a profan .In such context , the observ of Richard Sever , who run the bioRxiv server at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratori , consid the best known place to post biolog preprint , becom harder to ignor , research say .Some journal editor say that preprint would be detriment to scienc . Emili Marcu , the editor of Cell , told scientist at the # ASAPbio confer that in convers with more than 100 scientist Cell editor had found that the main reason they want to use preprint wa to scoop competitor , which she suggest would caus the qualiti of paper to declin as everyon rush to post first : I that the direct that we want to go ?  Other have argu on Twitter that allow research to reach the public without be review befor public would be irrespons .Preprint advoc counter that scientist care too much about their reput to publish shoddi work , and post to bioRxiv are clearli mark to indic that they may contain inform that ha not yet been accept or endors in ani way by the scientif or medic community. Other note that plenti of peer-review paper in high-profil journal have prove to be wrong , and some argu that carri out peer review after a paper is publish would provid a more rigor and fair vet of paper , anyway .Unlik some writer and artist who have use digit media to escap entir from middlemen , most biologist tweet with # ASAPbio want to maintain a relationship with tradit journal . Mani have taken pain to reiter their wish not to disrupt the journal system , onli to enhanc it . With enough scientist push to legitim preprint , they hope journal will allow the system to coexist .It not beer or taco ,  as Jame Fraser , an assist professor at the Univers of California , San Francisco put it at last month confer , it beer AND tacos.But other , includ the dean of Harvard Medic School , Jeffrey S. Flier , say disrupt journal could be a good thing for scienc .In ani case , some research say , a dtent between journal and preprint advoc may be short-liv . If univers librari drop their costli journal subscript in favor of free preprint , journal may well withdraw permiss to use them , forc biomed research to make a harder choic . The preprint movement , some # ASAPbio advoc argu , may presag the need for a greater cultur shift than scientist have not yet been will to make : evalu one anoth base on the substanc of their paper , not where they are publish .

The mani decor embellish on dy wool fabric and undi linen made these product even more out of reach to ordinari peopl . Onli emperor or the superrich could afford tunic and mantl decor with pattern color with purpl dye made from the glandular fluid of Murex sea snail in the eastern Mediterranean .These dye were some of the most expens commod in the ancient world . Likewis , silk begin to trickl in from China were still a luxuri few could afford . A tailor tunic on display combin the usual wool and linen , but with some silk trim . It wa found in ancient Panopoli , a center of earli textil product now known as Akhmim , in central Egypt .Dr. Thoma , write in the exhibit catalog , said these high cost meant that lavish textil came to signifi wealth and prestig . Their product and acquisit , she ad , were key aspect of household economi , in the sphere of women. Spindl , loom and other textile-work instrument are often found in domest context at the region archaeolog site .Also , Late Antiqu textil carri conceptu associ differ from those today . The busi loom evok hallow ideal of virtuou women work to contribut to and sustain the household ,  Dr. Thoma wrote , cite the endur exampl of Homer stori of the faith Penelop . She duti kept weav and reweav a shroud for her father-in-law while await the return of her wander husband .Tunic appear to be in fashion throughout Late Antiqu . They were often singl piec of fabric drape over the bodi , usual loos and sometim more form-fit . For women they reach to the feet , for men to the knee .Even children wore tunic . On exhibit is a garment with an ornament hood to be pull over a child head . The first hoodi ?Some expert were not sure what to make of one wall tapestri . It depict a servant wait for a command .

Onc there , they head north to the Brazilian border for a coupl of day , lure by Igauzu Fall .She recal the excit when their phones GP indic they final were in Brazil , and the awe-inspir wall of water , some more than 24 stori tall .And , she rememb , everywher there were mosquito , leav bite on her thigh .Back home the first week of Januari , Ms. Levi learn she wa four week pregnant .Her first pregnanc had end in miscarriag in Septemb , so it wa with some hesit that she left for anoth trip , thi time to Puerto Rico for a rendezv with her aunt and sister .As soon as she arriv , local news broadcast began warn pregnant women about the danger of infect with the Zika viru , carri by mosquito and suspect of caus devast birth defect in infant born to infect women .She book the first avail flight home .I wa on the beach for a few hour and didnt put on ani bug spray ,  said Ms. Levi , a 35-year-old psychotherapist . I had two bite when I got home Sunday.I think I would have been more panicki if I hadnt told myself I need to keep it togeth for my baby.The Zika viru is not yet known to be circul in the continent Unit State . But alreadi , fear of the infect ha come home for mani pregnant women and their famili who journey abroad befor the risk were known .The Center for Diseas Control and Prevent recent report that nine pregnant women were known to have becom infect while travel . Yet mani more are cope with the possibl of exposur , reach out to their doctor for blood test and ultrasound , obsess on news coverag and tri to manag their worri .The C.D.C . recommend that pregnant women receiv blood test two to 12 week after travel to an affect area to detect whether they may have been infect with the Zika viru .Those who may have been expos are urg to consid have extra ultrasound to look for birth defect in the develop fetu .Noth is guarante ; the antibodi test ha it limit . Ultrasound often do not detect fetal microcephali , the diseas caus misshapen head and brain damag that ha been link to infect with the viru .Accord to the C.D.C. , the scan are most accur at the end of the second trimest or earli in the third .The risk is small , but the effect are tragic ,  said Craig Forest , 37 , an associ professor of bioengin at Georgia Tech in Atlanta .He and hi wife , Roxann , 32 , spent Christma vacat in Costa Rica just as she wa enter her second trimest of pregnanc .They chose that destin becaus of all the countri in the region , it seem to offer the safest environ for a pregnant woman .After 10 day of rain forest hike and lazi sunset on the beach , Ms. Forest wa cover with insect bite .Back home in Januari , the coupl began hear news report about the Zika viru . Costa Rica wa not mention .Im look at the list and think , That all of Costa Rica neighbor ; we dodg a bullet on that one ,   Mr. Forest said .On Feb. 1 , Costa Rica wa ad to the list of countri in which Zika is circul . The viru had been in the countri sinc at least Decemb .Ms. Forest doctor did not order a blood test for the infect , becaus she had not had ani symptom . Her most recent ultrasound appear normal , and the coupl say they will ask for anoth at the cutoff time for an abort .They have lain in bed at night discuss the possibl , someth that would have been unthink a coupl of month ago .They know the risk are remot  first that she might have been bitten by an infect mosquito , and second that the infect might lead to a birth defect .A analyt mind peopl , wer tri to calcul the odd ,  said Ms. Forest , who is also an engin .But when they tri to figur the likelihood of a birth defect relat to the Zika viru , all they can come up with is not zero.There is noth to do but wait . I actual tri to stop read the news ,  Ms. Forest said .Even when a pregnant woman is found to have been infect , test of blood or amniot fluid can not definit tell if the fetu wa affect , said Dr. W. Ian Lipkin , an expert in infecti diseas at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health , who is work to develop a more reliabl altern .Microcephali seem to be a rel rare complic . But it also possibl that the viru may caus more subtl damag that we cant yet appreci ,  Dr. Lipkin said .Sydney Silverstein , 35 , an Emori Univers doctor candid , ha been live in Iquito , Peru , sinc Juli . She is eight and a half month pregnant .There is no widespread epidem of Zika viru in Peru , but the viru is present in Lima . Moreov , she spent time on the Brazilian border in late fall , earli in her pregnanc .She ha had extra ultrasound scan from her doctor , and her fetu look unaffect .Her husband , Nick , travel back and forth from hi job in Ohio , and her parent have been urg her to leav befor the viru spread to her part of the countri . I have a famili that is awesom and support  and a littl freak out ,  she said .Ms. Silverstein decid to remain in Peru , believ the risk to her babi boy are not great and want to complet the research she ha start .Still , the differ between her circumst as an American and those of other local women smack you in the face ,  she said .Deep down , I knew I had the option to leav if I thought I had to. Most women in Latin America can not .In late Februari , just after Ami Levi first heard her baby heartbeat in the doctor offic , her Zika antibodi test result came back neg . For the first time in week , I felt like I could breath ,  she said .She had spent an anxiou month worri that she had put her babi in danger , though she knew the guilt to be illog . Even now , Ms. Levi say she is nag by the knowledg that the test are not foolproof . She plan to ask for an extra ultrasound when she is further along .She take no chanc , even tini one . At her doctor suggest , she cancel a come trip to Florida becaus the local health author had declar a public health emerg in Miami-Dad Counti .I see those pictur , and I feel connect to those mother in Brazil ,  she said . Thi is a realli horribl situation.', 'Pregnant women and their unborn children are particularli vulner to malaria : the women becaus they may develop lethal anemia , and the babi becaus infect red blood cell tend to clump in the placenta , rob the fetu of nutrient .In Africa , about 30 million women a year becom pregnant in area where falciparum malaria  the most danger kind  is common .To protect them , health agenc use intermitt prevent treatment ,  or I.P.T. , under which all pregnant women in such area are given dose of anti-malari drug at regular interv , whether or not they are test for the diseas .But malaria fighter sharpli disagre over how to do it , and a studi recent publish by The New England Journal of Medicin add fuel to the debat .To cure malaria , virtual everyon in the field use two-drug cocktail contain artemisinin , a deriv of the sweet wormwood plant .But for prevent malaria in pregnant women , the World Health Organ recommend onli an older drug combin , sulfadoxine-pyrimethamin  also known as Fansidar  even though resist to it is spread in Africa .The new studi , led by scientist from Uganda and the Univers of California , San Francisco , found that women who receiv sulfadoxine-pyrimethamin for prevent were much more like to develop malaria symptom dure pregnanc and to have parasit in the placenta when their babi were born .A similar studi done in Kenya and publish in The Lancet in 2015 had similar result .Some expert believ the W.H.O . should chang it recommend . To me , it shock that it take so long ,  said Dr. Grant Dorsey , who research malaria at U.C.S.F . and is an author of the Uganda studi .Other malaria-fight group are not endors chang .The old method is imperfect but still usual prevent death , said Dr. Estrella Lasri , a tropic medicin advis at Doctor Without Border . Use artemisinin for prevent could speed the emerg of parasit resist to it .We need artemesinin for treatment , so we dont want to burn it out ,  she said .The President Malaria Initi , the American government global malaria-fight program , which ha paid for 42 million dose of I.P.T . sinc 2005 , still think the old method protect fetus well enough to justifi continu use , a spokesman said .The except is in a small region of East Africa , where the initi is back a trial of new method .', 'On March 6 , 1857 , The New-York Time describ the commenc exercis at New-York Medic Colleg . The first prize for the best thesi went to Nehemiah Nickerson for hi thesi on Infantil Paralysis. It wa the first time the newspap mention what would come to be known as polio .The Time said littl els about infantil paralysi or poliomyel until Aug. 4 , 1899 , when an articl with the headlin Puzzl Child Disease appear on Page 3 .By Aug. 7 , polio wa front-pag news . The diseas wa spread with remark rapid ,  with more case in Poughkeepsi , N.Y. , and nearbi town .Then , apart from a brief mention in Decemb 1900 , infantil paralysi disappear from The Time until the summer of 1907 , when anoth outbreak prompt sever report .After 1910 , infantil paralysi wa in the paper often . In Juli 1916 , dure an epidem that infect hundr of New Yorker and kill about a fifth of them , almost everi day edit contain an articl about it . That terrifi summer , The Time report case in New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Massachusett , Rhode Island , Maryland , Wisconsin , Illinoi and Indiana .On Sept. 16 , 1921 , the paper report that Franklin D. Roosevelt had been brought to Presbyterian Hospit in New York , suffer from poliomyel  which for more than a month ha caus the loss of the use of both leg below the knees.In June 1934 , the name of anoth man appear , along with the other 1,855 graduat of the Citi Colleg of New York .It wa the first mention of Jona Salk , who would invent the polio vaccin .', 'Their websit show peac scene  young women relax by the ocean or care for hors in emerald pastur  and boast of their chef and other amen .One center send out invit to a recept with cocktail and hor doeuvr . Anoth offer doctor and therapist all-expense-paid trip to visit and experi their offer , includ yoga class . Sever employ staff who call mental health profession , say they would love to have lunch .The market effort by these for-profit residenti care center are aim at patient with eat disord and the clinician who treat them . The program have prolifer in recent year , with some compani expand across the countri .The rapid growth of the industri  there are more than 75 center , compar with 22 a decad ago , accord to one count  ha been propel by the Afford Care Act and other chang in health insur law that have increas coverag for mental disord , as well as by invest from privat equiti firm .The residenti program , their director say , fill a dire need , serv patient from area where no adequ treatment is avail . Onli 15 to 30 percent of peopl have access to special care for eat disord , which mean there are a lot of peopl out there who have zippo ,  said Doug Bunnel , the chief clinic offic for Mont Nido , a program that began in Malibu , Calif. , and now oper center in five state .But the advertis and the profus of center , which typic cost $ 1,000 a day but can run much higher , is rais concern among some eat disord expert , who worri that some program may be take advantag of vulner patient and their famili .In the companies rush to expand , they argu , qualiti of treatment may be sacrif for profit . And they question whether the spalik atmospher of some program is so comfort that it foster depend .For the most part , the peopl who are run and work in these program believ theyr do the right thing ,  said Dr. Angela Guarda , the director of the eat disord program at the John Hopkin Hospit in Baltimor .But it a slipperi slope ,  she said . Money can cloud your view.Mani eat disord specialist agre that some patient requir the supervis of residenti program and benefit from the treatment . But studi show the programs effect are scant , Dr. Guarda and other expert said . The method of the hand of studi that exist have been critic .The qualiti and form of treatment vari wide across center , and in some case includ approach  equin therapi , for exampl , or faith-based treatment  with littl or no scientif evid behind them . Some program have full-tim psychiatrist and medic doctor on staff , but other lack the expertis to handl emerg or treat patient with coexist medic or psychiatr problem .The perk offer to outsid clinician who might refer patient , the expert say , includ free trip , restaur meal , educ seminar and small gift like pen and key chain dispens at profession meet . Critic liken them to pharmaceut industri tactic that led to law and polici requir financi disclosur , though on a smaller scale . Studi had shown that even small gift from drug compani , like free medic sampl , affect doctors prescript practic .In an articl to be publish Monday in the journal Psychiatr Servic , Dr. Evelyn Attia , a professor of psychiatri and director of the eat disord program at Columbia Univers Medic Center , and four colleagu call for more transpar about the financi relationship between residenti center and the profession who send them patient , and urg clinician to be mind of effort to influenc their recommend treatment .The effect of these clinician induc , which are aim at build a program patient referr base , may not be fulli recogn by the profession they target ,  wrote Dr. Attia and her colleagu , who includ Dr. Guarda .Sever industri repres said that while they had not seen the journal articl , they agre that more data on patient outcom and stricter standard were need . But , they said , the trip and seminar offer to clinician were primarili educ . I dont think anyon in the eat disord world is give out swim pool and trip to Europ and thing like that ,  Dr. Bunnel said .Jillian Lampert , presid of the Residenti Eat Disord Consortium , a group that repres about 85 percent of the center , said , Health care alway been a busi ,  ad that qualiti and profit were not mutual exclus . If there are concern , she said , we are incred open to have those conversations.Eat disord are among the most difficult mental ill to treat .Anorexia , in particular , ha stymi mani of psychiatry best treatment effort . The ill ha the highest mortal rate of ani mental disord , with patient die from the medic complic of starvat or from suicid . And patient often resist treatment that make them feel uncomfort .The most sever ill patient  the prognosi is grimmer the longer someon ha anorexia , studi suggest  requir hospit treatment just to stay aliv . But even after be stabil , mani patient need continu supervis for a time to regain weight and learn new behavior . The length of stay in residenti center rang from two week to a year . A 2006 studi found that the averag stay wa 83 day .In the past , health insur compani place strict limit on coverag for eat disord , treat them differ from other medic ill . Few insur were will to pay for 24-hour care after a patient wa out of immedi danger .But the passag of the Mental Health Pariti and Addict Equiti Act in 2008 and the Afford Care Act two year later mandat equal treatment . Lawsuit brought by the famili of patient who were deni coverag ad to the pressur on insur . In 2012 , a feder appeal court rule that health plan must cover residenti treatment for anorexia under California pariti law . The higher reimburs rate offer some relief to famili , who had often mortgag their hous or drain their save to pay for critic need care .They also attract the attent of Wall Street investor , who saw profit in provid treatment for so-cal behavior health problem like eat disord , alcohol and drug abus . The number of cover live is grow faster than the avail of servic to treat them , creat compel invest opportun ,  the account and consult firm BDO note last year in an articl on it websit , refer to the effect of the legal chang .As the industri ha expand , larger center have acquir smaller one and some program , flush with privat equiti invest , have expand across the countri .For exampl , Mont Nido , a treatment program found by Carolyn Costin , a former teacher who recov from an eat disord , began with a center in Malibu .But in 2012 , with financ from Centr Partner , a middle-market equiti firm , Mont Nido began open new residenti center and day-treat program . The compani now ha center in Oregon , Massachusett , Pennsylvania and New York , includ one in a renov mansion in Westchest Counti .Last year , note that the invest had tripl the company facil footprint dure our ownership period ,  Centr Partner sold Mont Nido to anoth invest firm , Levin Leichtman Capit Partner , for an undisclos sum .I believ that the Mont Nido [ sic ] approach to eat disord treatment is what you and other like you have been wait for ,  Ms. Costin wrote in a letter to potenti patient on the company websit , which includ imag of beach , mountain and the Boston skylin on it home page .With a need to fill more bed , market for some center make cold call to psychiatrist , psychotherapist , medic doctor and other who treat eat disord , offer to inform them about a program advantag and invit them to visit .The Denver-bas Eat Recoveri Center ha a call center and employ 20 profession relat liaisons who contact clinician across the countri . The author and motiv speaker Jenni Schaefer , who recov from an eat disord , recent join the program outreach team . On it websit , the compani , which began with a singl center , bill itself as the onli nation health care system devot to seriou eat disord at all level of care.Craig Johnson , a well-known eat disord specialist , join the compani in 2010 and ha seen it through it expans to 24 treatment program in seven state , includ three residenti center . He said when therapist visit , the focu is educ , not entertain . Wer deliv lectur ,  Dr. Johnson said .Some therapist see the offer of free trip as a chanc to view the facil that they might recommend to patient .Ann Jacob Smith , a famili therapist in Chevi Chase , Md. , said that last year , she accept an invit to visit the Oliver-Pyatt eat disord center in Miami . ( The center is now part of Mont Nido ) .It wa absolut promot ,  she said , But it wa actual realli educ . They took us in depth into what they did.Her later referr were not influenc by the visit , she ad . Im not impress by be romanced.But Adrian Brown , a psychiatrist in Virginia , said that therapist who had not gone through the battl phase with drug compani might not even realiz they were be sway by financi interest .Dr. Brown recal be offer a V.I.P. trip to a treatment center , with the repres tell her , We will pay your way , put you up in a realli nice hotel , all expens paid , yoga and whatever.Dr. Brown respond , No , that not ethical.The repres repli , What do you mean ?  Anoth invit arriv the next year .Prospect patient or famili member search for a treatment program sometim turn to site like edtreatmentreview.com or www.edtxreviews.com , where former patient describ their experi at differ center , evalu the staff , critiqu the food and note whether cellphon are allow .Mani review have spent time in more than one residenti center and the opinion on ani particular program vari wide , a rang reflect in interview with former patient over the last sever month .Tina Klau , a 51-year-old artist who ha struggl with bulimia sinc she wa 10 , said residenti care wa initi use .Residenti treatment is vital when you are at your ultim rock bottom she said . But onc home , her ill worsen becaus your go back into your life , your go back into all the emot you use your eat disord to hide from.Melissa R. , 28 , who ask that her last name not be use for reason of privaci , said after sever hospit for anorexia , begin when she wa 21 , she found a residenti center in the Southwest on the Internet and spent six week there . The center , which she describ as more like a resort ,  wa somewhat help ,  she said , but not worth the time and money .Peopl were nice , and the food wa realli good ,  she said . I had fun , I enjoy rock climb and stuff , but that not whi I wa there . Im pay a lot of money to get well , not to rock climb.Last year , she spent two month at Eat Recoveri Center in Denver , move from residenti care to day treatment , and began to gain control of her ill . E.R.C . wa the best place Iv been ,  she said about the center . They were veri individualized.Ashley Bilki , 29 , had a differ experi with E.R.C . When she return home in Februari 2015 after about six month in the Denver program  her fourth stay in an inpati program for treatment of anorexia and her second at E.R.C .  I wa get sicker and sicker ,  she said . She lost the weight she had gain back at the center . I had to buy children cloth ,  she said .She wa evas with her parent . At the recoveri center , she said , It wa kind of like they set up a battl between myself and my parents. For their part , Ms. Bilkie parent , who for year had watch their daughter health declin , grew frantic . Ms. Bilki would disappear , her father , Robert Bilki , said , and he would find her wander the aisl at Kroger or Target . Drive through the neighborhood , he half-expect to see her hang from a tree .It a parent worst nightmar ,  he said .It wa also expens . Mr. Bilki , a financi advis in Michigan , calcul that over three year , he paid at least $ 350,000 for unreimburs inpati care for hi daughter . The Eat Recoveri Center , he said , sent him bill for $ 30,000 each month . Mr. Bilki paid willingli  he wa desper to see Ashley get well , he said  but no program seem to produc last result .We spent an outrag amount of money for what realli amount to ineffectu treatment ,  Mr. Bilki said .Last fall , Ms. Bilki enter the eat disord center at the John Hopkin Medic Center , a univers affili program .The staff there gradual wean her off some drug she had been take take at the center in Denver , includ high dose of Xanax , a tranquil , and Adderal , an attent deficit drug and a stimul .In group therapi , other patient put pressur on her to chang her behavior . It wa a switch , she said , from previou group , where patient talk about their problem . With the program stress on weight restor  studi show that it is the best predictor of how anorex patient will do onc they leav , rather than , say , elev mood  her weight return to normal .She wa discharg in Novemb and continu to do well .I hate everi singl solitari second of it ,  she said of the experi . But that a good thing , becaus I wa not comfort , and it meant that someth wa working.Dr. Ovidio Bermudez , the chief clinic offic of Eat Recoveri Center , said that other patient have fare poorli at academ center and then done well at E.R.C . Despit Ms. Bilkie percept , he said , therapist at the program did not tri to divid patient from their famili . ( Ms. Bilki gave Eat Recoveri Center permiss to discuss her case . )We would have to filter thi through 20/20 hindsight ,  Dr. Bermudez said . It realli hard to know what somebody frame of mind is and the degre of fragil they bring to ani treatment experience.Dr. Ann Mari OMelia , a psychiatrist at the recoveri center , said Ms. Bilki wa on Xanax when she arriv and wa fear of reduc the drug dosag , though the center tri . She wa switch to Adderal from anoth stimul at E.R.C. , Dr. OMelia said , to treat signific impulsivity.Ms. Bilkie histori of up and down is not unusu for patient with eat disord .In mani case , you see one step forward , two step back ,  said Dr. Mark Friedland , the chief medic offic for Aetna Behavior Health .Hi compani , Dr. Friedland said , consid residenti care essenti for treatment of some patient . But , he said , a lack of outcom studi , an absenc of industri standard and a patchwork licens system across state make it difficult for Aetna or other insur to evalu care .We would love to see greater consist and higher standard ,  he said .To that end , a group of eat disord specialist from treatment center , includ Eat Recoveri Center and Mont Nido , have develop a list of minimum requir for accredit of residenti program . The Joint Commiss , an independ compani that accredit health care facil , ha adopt the requir , which go into effect Juli 1 .Dr. Lampert , presid of the consortium , said the center in the organ were also collect data on patient outcom , length of stay and other variabl , with each center collect data on 15 consecut admiss of adult and adolesc .In the meantim , mani patient and famili will continu to reli on word of mouth and ani inform they can find onlin .These are black box ,  Dr. Scott Hadland , an adolesc medicin specialist at Harvard Medic School , said of the residenti center . Peopl get the idea that these are place that can heal just base on what they see on a websit or in the photos.', 'Choos a residenti treatment program for eat disord can be challeng . Websit may show scenic landscap and comfort interior , but there is an absenc of industri standard and research indic which type of program are effect .Specialist who treat eat disord  ill that affect an estim 30 million American at some point  advis look for center that : Place a prioriti on therapi that focu on behavior , rather than on identifi the root of the eat disord .Unless you can chang the behavior , no amount of insight-ori therapi is help ,  said Dr. Angela Guarda , the director of the eat disord center at the John Hopkin Hospit in Baltimor . Provid inform about the averag weight gain per week for anorex patient at the center and the percent of adult patient discharg with a bodi mass index of 19 or abov , indic a normal weight . Includ evidence-bas treatment , such as cognit behavior therapi , for bulimia . Have the resourc avail for emerg and to treat patient who have coexist medic or psychiatr problem . Are accredit by the Joint Commiss , an independ compani that accredit health care facil , which recent adopt new requir for such center .Mani program includ what they call outcom data on their websit . But eat disord expert say that data often exclud patient who drop out of treatment . Mani also reli on telephon survey to reach patient after discharg . The other half of the peopl who didnt answer your phone call are most like not do so well ,  said Dr. Evelyn Attia , a psychiatri professor at Columbia Univers .Outcom data that includ onli score on test of depress and anxieti should also be view skeptic , the expert said , becaus ani treatment would probabl have some benefici effect on mood .', 'The beast that river-dwel have long fear is come later thi week .It a wave call Pororoca , the great roar , and it low bellow can be heard up to an hour befor it arriv .

What could be caus black stain on the wall abov each segment of our radiat ? Could the heat fuel be leak from the radiat into the air we breath ?A . The stain are come from the air , not the radiat , and while the furnac and the chimney should be check , there are other possibl sourc besid heat fuel for the black materi .Such stain , call ghost by build engin , are caus by deposit of soot , dust or ordinari dirt carri by the air and then deposit on the wall or ceil .The pattern of the deposit depend on factor like air current , graviti , electrostat attract and temperatur and humid differ . For exampl , the reason the stain mirror the radiat segment is probabl that the wall temperatur vari with the shape of the radiat .One of the most common sourc of soot is partli burn carbon fuel , but soot could come from cook fume , cigarett and fireplac as well as the furnac . A surprisingli big sourc of the carbon that caus ghost stain is perfum room candl , a 2001 review of previou studi found .As for health risk , they are relat to the size of the particl ; the smaller the particl , the higher the risk , the Environment Protect Agenc say .The visibl soot can be a signal of the presenc of the more danger microscop particl , less than 10 micromet in diamet , that can penetr deep into the lung and caus heart and respiratori ill . question @ nytimes.com', 'I know my televis is too loud .Im ask peopl to repeat themselv more often .Im the restaur patron ask the manag to pleas turn down the music so I can hear my friend across the tabl .Almost two-third of American older than 70 have meaning hear loss , expert say , and I probabl will be among them . I should do someth about it .One reason I havent is the averag price for hear aid : roughli $ 2,500 , often more  and most of us need two . That help explain whi onli 20 percent of those with hear loss use hear aid .Medicar declin to cover a number of product and servic that older beneficiari need . Dental care rank high on my person list of exclus that make the least sens , but the fact that the 1965 Medicar law specif prohibit the nation insur program from pay for hear aid is also a strong contend .So it hearten to notic some recent develop that might lead to more ration polici and more afford and access devic . An Octob report by the President Council of Advisor on Scienc and Technolog recommend feder action to simultan decreas the cost of hear aid , spur technolog innov and increas consum choic options.The council suggest , for exampl , that the Food and Drug Administr permit a basic hear aid , for mild to moder age-rel hear loss , to be sold over the counter  someth everi state prohibit .The report also urg the Feder Trade Commiss , whose rule enabl consum to comparison shop for eyeglass and contact lens , to treat hear devic more like visual one . It should be like a prescript for eyeglass ,  said Dr. Christin Cassel , a co-chairwoman of the council hear technolog work group .The hear aid itself repres onli about a third of what audiologist charg . ( Medicar doe cover test with a physician referr . )After an audiologist or physician provid an audiogram assess your hear , Dr. Cassel said , you should be abl to take it with you and shop around for the best prices on devic . In June , the Institut of Medicin will issu a report on hear health that tackl key question like feder regul , insur and price . A number of major player  among them the Center for Diseas Control and Prevent , the Nation Institut on Age and the Pentagon  have sponsor the yearlong effort . The F.D.A. , act on recommend by the president council , will host a public workshop next month to consid whether it hear aid regul may hinder innov , reduc competit and lead to increas cost and reduc use.The agenc ha also reopen public comment on propos regul of so-cal person sound amplif product and their market .Report , comment , workshop  we can be forgiven for roll our eye and wonder if anyth use will emerg . Still , these action repres a greater nation focu on hear loss and rehabilit than we have seen in decad .What drive thi interest , apart from the demograph bulg that mean the hearing-impair popul is about to grow much larger , is a wave of new research .Congress ban Medicar coverag of hear aid 50 year ago becaus peopl thought hear loss wa just a normal part of age ,  said Dr. Cassel , one of the author of a recent JAMA editori on hear health polici . They didnt see it as a disabl or a medic problem.But wer learn that , howev normal , hear loss can have signific consequ .Older adult with poor hear report a greater number of fall than those with normal hear , a Finnish studi found . American research have demonstr a similar associ in those 40 to 69 .Older adult with hear loss are also more apt to report period of poor physic and mental health , and to be hospit .Perhap most disturb , studi also show a relationship between hear loss  mild , moder or sever  and acceler rate of cognit declin . Older peopl with hear loss also are more like than those with normal hear to develop dementia .How can age ear affect so mani other aspect of our health ? Dr. Frank Lin , an otolaryngologist and epidemiologist at John Hopkin Univers who ha led mani of these research effort , point to sever possibl caus . With diminish hear , your brain is constantli have to work harder to process garbl sounds  a concept call cognit load  and may have less capac for other mental task .Altern , hear loss may lead to chang in brain structur . In one of Dr. Lin studi , magnet reson imag test show greater brain atrophi among those with poor hear .A struggl to hear can also lead to isol , and wev known for year that social connected is import for cognit health ,  Dr. Lin ad .Technolog put the Internet in our pocket , but hasnt done much to afford improv our hear .In everi other aspect of our live , advanc in electron technolog have made thing cost much , much less ,  Dr. Cassel said . That hasnt happen with hear aids.Almost annual , she ad , some congressperson get energ about thi and tri to pass legislation to remov Medicare hear aid restrict . Last year , it wa Repres Debbi Dingel , Democrat of Michigan , with six Democrat co-sponsor . The bill stall in committe , but we are not give up the fight ,  Ms. Dingel said in an email .Drive down the cost of the devic could make them more wide avail in sever way .If it $ 200 instead of $ 2,000 , more peopl could pay out of pocket ,  Dr. Cassel said . And that also mean Medicar might cover it  unlik at current price .It clearli possibl to provid good devic for far less than we now pay . The Depart of Veteran Affair , which negoti with manufactur for lower price , provid comprehens hear care to more than 900,000 veteran in 2014 and dispens almost 800,000 hear aid without copay . The averag cost per devic : $ 400 .Price isnt the onli obstacl to wider use . In European countri where insur doe cover hear aid , theyr still underus . Clearli , our discomfort with age-rel disabl play a role .So do the shortcom of hear aid . Though theyr improv , no technolog will ever correct hear loss like glass correct vision ,  Dr. Lin said .As hear declin with age , the cochlea , the part of the inner ear that receiv and transmit sound , sustain irrevers damag .Still , the way we acquir hear aid , or dont , ha cost beyond the obviou . Daunt by the multipl visit , the adjust and especi the expens , peopl often delay for year while their mild or moder hear loss worsen .Over that time , youv lost some of the neural pathway from the ear to the brain ,  Dr. Lin said . With longstand hear loss , rehabilit is much harder . The earlier you address it , the easier it is and the more success you can be.', 'Sexual cannib make mate danger for male spider of mani speci .The femal may gobbl up the male befor , dure or after mate , so male have evolv variou way to cheat death .

They left other male free to execut the usual plan . As expect , the male that couldnt produc silk were eaten much more often than the other male .Male with longer leg were also more success at surviv , show that size is import if you are in a speci in which courtship make mix martial art look like a Texa two-step .Ms. Anderson , whose work on the spider is part of her doctor research , want to determin if there is a benefit for the femal as well as the male in thi kind of mate .The male who are abl to wrap the females leg have more success copul , as measur by the number of insert of the pedipalp , which deliv sperm to the femal .

Or confus morn , realli . Come Daylight Save Time each year , peopl often complain about how thrown off they feel by the shift of an hour .I thought they were just whini . That is , until my dinosaur got jet lag and refus to glow .Sinc that not an everyday occurr , let me explain the dinosaur first , and then Ill get to how my dinosaur problem may be connect to your own struggl to function over the next few day . ( Hint : It not onli the loss of sleep that caus problem . )Meet my dinosaur , glimmer bright , fulli recov from jet lag .Creat by a compani call BioPop , my Dino Pet contain lot of itti bitti dinoflagel . Dinoflagel , if you are have troubl summon a sixth-grad biolog lesson , are usual ocean-dwel , single-cel organ also known as marin plankton . Peopl typic encount them when they clean the insid of their aquarium ( thi form is often refer brown slime algae ) or if they happen to be kayak through a bay fill with lot of bioluminesc one .The one that live in my plastic dinosaur ( a Christma gift ) are the latter kind . Shake them just a bit and the transpar creatur becom a glow-in-the-dark snow globe .Except that a week after I set my dinosaur up , it still refus to put on it shimmer show . I tri everyth . I move it from darker to lighter spot . I play it music and whisper encourag word . But when I turn off the light , my littl dino remain depressingli dark .And then upon revisit the instruct , everyth wa illumin :Until now , your dinoflagel were rais in San Diego , Calif.. Theyv been wake up at 5 a.m. and go to bed around 6 p.m. P.S.T . Thi is the routin theyr use to . Thi routin can be chang , but you have to be awar of the routin theyv been on and be patient while they adapt to their new environ and routin .In other word , the dinoflagel on my night stand in New York had sever jet lag .They get use to thi schedul ,  said Dimitri Deheyn , BioPop scientif advis and a research at the Scripp Institut of Oceanographi in San Diego .Bring guest by the BioPop lab and turn off the light even just one hour earlier than usual and the show will be mute , he and other who work there say . ( Though appar some can get it togeth better than other . ) Expect the dino to perform on demand after a long journey to anoth time zone ? Forget it .Like human , dinoflagel follow a roughli 24-hour circadian cycl trigger by phase of sunlight . Unlik human who may find way to mask their irrit , sleepi or lack of concentr , dinoflagel are veri direct about their inabl to perform when their schedul is out of whack : They simpli wont glow the same way . ( A number of biologist who have help advanc our understand of human sleep cycl made initi circadian breakthrough with these organ for connect reason . )Children can be similarli transpar , Dr. Deheyn point out .If there is still light out , it definit not time to go to bed ,  he said , liken hi 6-year-old son experi with Daylight Save Time to that of a dino with jet lag . Even though you tri to explain the time chang to him , hi bodi will react to the light . It onli an hour . But it take week to recov from that change.In the same vein , lose an hour is a big deal for reason beyond lost sleep .Rememb , we have clock in everi organ in our bodi ,  said Robert Thoma , the director of a sleep medicin fellowship at Harvard Beth Israel Deaco Medic Center . Ani kind of shift , small or larg , mean , Your not just move sleep your move your entir bodi . It like a giant ocean liner . A big ocean liner slowli chug away . You cant just jerk it around.Dr. Thoma , who also run a sleep lab focus on help individu with extrem sleep disord get on a more normal schedul , take the impact of light serious in hi home as well . Everi night at 8 p.m. he turn off all the light so as to avoid the risk of push hi circadian system into anoth time zone . Becaus we talk on the phone closer to 9 , thi meant hi end of the convers wa conduct in complet dark .If jet lag wa perman , it would probabl kill us ,  he said .But in the grand scheme of circadian disrupt , a biannual shift in an hour is not the end of the world for human  or dinoflagel .Dr. Deheyn advis dino owner to respect that their tini pet may need a few day to adjust . ( Even if dino dont have to be anywher an hour earlier in their circadian cycl , they may suffer from their owners turn the light on and off at new time and then expect an unusu earli perform . )Dont shake them too much or lower the temperatur ,  he said . It the cumul stress that can throw them off even more.Human , it seem , would benefit from a similar approach .Full dino disclosur : The dinoflagel in the batch at top are differ from my origin slow-adjust batch . After two week , I got onli a poppy-se size glimmer , so I wash them down the sink . I do feel bad about thi now that I know more about dinoflagellates circadian rhythm . But it possibl , the peopl at BioPop told me while talk to them for thi articl , that my batch of dino had problem beyond jet lag .

Think , for a moment , of carbon dioxid as garbag , a wast product from burn fossil fuel . Like other garbag , almost all of that CO2 is thrown away  into the atmospher , where it contribut to climat chang . A small amount is captur and store underground to keep it out of the air .But increasingli , scientist are ask , rather than throw away or store CO2 , how about recycl some of it ?At laboratori around the world , research are work on way to do just that . The X Prize Foundat ha creat an incent , a $ 20 million prize for team that by 2020 come up with technolog to turn CO2 captur from smokestack of coal- or gas-fir power plant into use product .But perhap the ultim goal of research in thi field is to turn the wast product of fuel-burn into new fuel . In theori , if thi could be done on a larg scale use renew energi or even sunlight , there would be no net gain of emiss  the same carbon dioxid molecul would be emit , captur , made into new fuel and emit again , over and over .The grand prize is figur out how to make CO2 be recycl , a renew resourc ,  said Harri A. Atwat , a materi scientist at the California Institut of Technolog and director of the Joint Center for Artifici Photosynthesi , which ha laboratori at the Lawrenc Berkeley Nation Laboratori here and at Caltech . That would be a millenni advanc for society.Carbon dioxid is use to make some basic product like urea fertil and specialti plastic . But the process are not necessarili energi effici , and almost all use CO2 from natur underground reservoir . Even if compani start use carbon dioxid that wa captur , the amount would be less than 0.5 percent of the roughli 32 billion metric ton of CO2 emit annual by human activ .What Dr. Atwat and other have in mind are devic that , if scale up , could recycl a signific portion of carbon dioxid that is captur from power plant or process like cement manufactur , or even directli from the atmospher .But develop devic that can effici and econom convert larg amount of CO2 will requir overcom mani hurdl , not the least of which is all the energi requir to split carbon dioxid molecul .The big challeng is , how do we go from milligram to megaton ?  said Dick T. Co , a Northwestern Univers professor and manag director of the Solar Fuel Institut , a group that encourag collabor among research in the field . How do we make a dent in our energi portfolio when peopl are work in test tube today ? In a research build at the Lawrenc Berkeley lab , with a view of San Francisco Bay in the distanc , Dr. Atwat lead a team of scientist that is tri to mimic what plant do through photosynthesi . They want to take CO2 and water and , use onli sunlight , turn it into fuel .The center , start in 2010 with a grant from the Depart of Energi , devot it first five year to one aspect of photosynthesi : split water into it compon , hydrogen and oxygen .Dr. Atwat , Franc A. Houl , a deputi director , and Karl Walczak , a project scientist , show some of the fruit of that work  a chip-siz sandwich of semiconductor materi , catalyst and membran encas in a clear contain with a water-bas solut . When the chip wa expos to light , bubbl of ga  hydrogen on one side , oxygen on the other  form , broke off and rose to the top .By their calcul , the chip is about 10 time more effici than a typic plant , which use about 1 percent of the sunlight that strike it .The center is now work on the carbon-dioxid part of the photosynthet equat . The goal is to integr the two process in a devic that might look a lot like a solar panel . But rather than gener electr , it would produc fuel  perhap methanol , which could be burn directli or convert to gasolin .Carbon dioxid is much more difficult to split than water , howev , involv six step , each requir energi and a catalyst . Natur appear to do it effortlessli , but it ha had million of year of evolut to improv the process .The big challeng with CO2 is that you produc a whole bunch of product ,  Dr. Atwat said . Natur ha develop veri refin mechan that produc precis one product.Much of the work at the center involv studi catalysi , through theoret analysi and test possibl combin of metal oxid to see how well they might work . The test method is similar to one use for drug discoveri , with equip that can analyz larg number of veri small sampl at a time .The goal is to make a devic that can make just one product , as in natur photosynthesi , but more effici . At the same time , the devic ha to be abl to last for year , as solar panel do . That add to the engin and design challeng .There are other research group , and some start-up and establish compani , that are work on CO2 convers as well . Sunfir , a compani in Dresden , Germani , built a prototyp to make synthet crude oil from carbon dioxid and water . Part of the crude is diesel fuel , and in 2015 , Audi use some of the Sunfir diesel to briefli power one of it car .The Sunfir process use electr , not sunlight , so the electr would have to come from renew sourc to result in meaning carbon reduct . Given the amount of electr is requir , a big challeng is produc fuel that could compet in price with convent fossil fuel , said Christian von Olshausen , Sunfire chief technolog offic .In Berkeley , at a lab build just down the hill from the Joint Center for Artifici Photosynthesi , three young scientist have start a small compani , Opu 12 , to develop their own CO2-convers devic , power by electr .Their idea is to exploit the fact that CO2 can be convert into mani differ product , by come up with catalyst tailor to produc specif one .Our vision is to design thi reactor more as a platform ,  said Nichola Flander , who found Opu 12 with Kendra Kuhl and Etosha Cave .The three met at Stanford , where they were work on advanc degre . About a year ago , they receiv financ and other assist , includ lab space , from the Lawrenc Berkeley lab under an energy-technolog incub program call Cyclotron Road .Dr. Kuhl and Dr. Cave studi catalysi at Stanford , and though their oper is far smaller than the center just up the hill , they are work on develop and fine-tun catalyst to effici convert CO2 . We make the secret sauc ,  Dr. Kuhl said .In their small lab , they spray catalyst for test onto a small membran , use modifi airbrush equip . The coat membran is then put into a prototyp reactor , about the size of a smartphon but thicker , which is hook up to sourc of CO2 , water and electr . What come out of the reactor  proprietari inform for now , the scientist say  is analyz for it puriti .Over the next year and a half , Mr. Flander said , the compani plan to scale up their reactor to someth the size of a dishwash . That would be big enough to start gener revenu by make small amount of product for nich applic that command a rel high price . Becaus of the electr need , ani devic they make would need to use renew electr to maxim the CO2-reduct benefit .Beyond that , Mr. Flander envis larger devic that could convert ton of carbon dioxid a day into fuel or other product . That still not veri much , given the billion of ton of CO2 pump into the atmospher everi day . But Opu 12 is in it for the long haul , he said .The Joint Center for Artifici Photosynthesi is , too , although Dr. Atwat is realist about the challeng of directli convert sunlight and CO2 into fuel .You can rest assur that the energi and catalysi problem of human will not have been resolv five year from now ,  he said .But there is grow interest in the work of Dr. Atwat and hi fellow research , particularli after the recent sign Pari climat treati that call for sharp emiss reduct to combat global warm .We have some wind at our back that we havent had until recent ,  he ad .', 'Anoth dwarf planet ha a moon .Astronom announc on Tuesday that they have spot a small moon around Makemak , one of the ici world beyond the orbit of Neptun .Thi distant region of the solar system , known as the Kuiper belt , ha been one of intrigu mysteri .

Brown , a professor of planetari astronomi at the California Institut of Technolog who led the team that discov Haumea , Makemak and Eri , and the moon of Haumea and Eri , had look for moon around Makemak , too . He did not find ani , but that wa not necessarili the end of the stori . Iv alway been suspici in the back of my mind ,  he said .Astronom led by Marc W. Buie of the Southwest Research Institut decid to use the Hubbl Space Telescop to take a closer look and see what might have been miss . They found a dot next to Makemak  the moon , which , for now , is design S/2015 ( 136472 ) 1 and nicknam MK 2 .When the moon turn up in the data , it wa not actual that faint ,  said Dr. Parker , who perform the imag analysi . ( For the astronom , 1/1,300th the bright of Makemak is consid not that faint . )The moon orbit is almost edge-on when seen from Earth . In the earlier observ , the moon wa , by chanc , too close to Makemak and obscur in the glare , Dr. Parker said .The astronom estim that MK 2 wa about 13,000 mile from Makemak and orbit about onc everi 12 day . More observ will enabl them to precis trace the orbit , and that will give an accur measur of the mass and densiti of Makemak .The discoveri should also help resolv one of Makemake mysteri : Temperatur data ha indic that most of the surfac is bright and cold , but some of it is dark and compar warm .Yet the bright of Makemak doe not chang as would be expect if the dark spot were rotat in and out of view .Perhap the dark , warm signal eman not from Makemake surfac , but from a moon cover with a charcoal-dark materi circl Makemak . A dark , warm moon about 100 mile wide would larg agre with the observ , Dr. Parker said .', 'Scientist recent turn Harvard Skelet Biolog Laboratori into a pop-up restaur . It would have fare veri badli on Yelp .Katherin D. Zink , then a graduat student , act as chef and waitress . First , she attach electrod to the jaw of diner to record the activ in the muscl they use to chew food . Then she brought out the victual .Some volunt receiv a three-cours vegetarian meal of carrot , yam or beet . In one cours , the veget were cook ; in the second , they were raw and slice ; in the last cours , Dr. Zink simpli serv raw chunk of plant matter .Other patron got three cours of meat ( goat , in thi case ) . Dr. Zink grill the meat in the first cours , but offer it raw and slice in the second . In the third cours , her volunt receiv an uncook lump of goat flesh .In some of the trial , the volunt chew the food until it wa readi to swallow and then spat it out . Dr. Zink painstakingli pick apart those food bit and measur their size .If that wa all my dissert wa , I would have quit graduat school ,  Dr. Zink said . It wa as love as it sounds.Dr. Zink persev , howev , becaus she wa explor a profound question about our origin : How did our ancestor evolv from small-brain , big-jaw ape into large-brain , small-jaw human ?Scientist studi the fossil record have long puzzl over thi transit , which happen around two million year ago . Befor then , earli human rel  known as hominin  were typic about the size of chimpanze , with massiv teeth and a brain onli a third the size of humans current brain .But with the emerg of speci like Homo erectu , hominin grew to about our current height , with brain twice as larg as those of their forebear .In the late 1990 , Richard W. Wrangham , an anthropologist at Harvard , propos that cook wa the key . Onc hominin learn to use fire , he suggest , they roast meat and starchi tuber they dug out of the ground .Cook food wa easier to chew and digest , and hominin no longer need big teeth to grind tough plant . Better yet , the extra calori they receiv help fuel hungri neuron and , eventu , bigger brain .While the oldest known hearth date to onli 400,000 year ago , Dr. Wrangham argu that hominin cook long befor then . At first , they might simpli have use natur fire to cook food befor master the art of make one themselv .Yet cook wa not the onli way hominin prepar food . As long as 3.5 million year ago , scientist have found , hominin were make stone tool . Cut mark on mammal bone suggest that the tool were use to carv meat from carcass .Earli hominin also made so-cal hammerston , which some research have specul were use to smash nut and other food .Dr. Zink and her advis at Harvard , Daniel E. Lieberman , wonder if stone tool help hominin digest meat and starchi tuber long befor cook wa invent . To explor that possibl , they open their unappet cafe .The find ? First , raw meat wa imposs for the subject to chew into smaller piec . It like chew gum ,  Dr. Zink said .But slice raw meat into smaller piec allow the volunt to grind it further into bit small enough to swallow . ( The test subject spat out the raw meat to avoid food poison . )Cook meat actual demand more chew , but it could be ground into even smaller particl that were digest with less effort .Slice raw veget did not make it easier for the volunt to eat them , the scientist found  but pound on the veget did . Cook made the veget even easier to consum .Base on their experi , Dr. Zink and Dr. Lieberman conclud that , long befor the invent of cook , stone tool could have made it easier for hominin to eat raw meat and tuber , conserv preciou energi .It wa surpris to us how effect it wa ,  Dr. Lieberman said . He and Dr. Zink report the result of their experi Wednesday in the journal Natur .Stone tool use to process meat and veget could have influenc the evolut of hominin .Big , strong teeth , for instanc , may have becom less import to their surviv . That can help explain the reduct of the face long befor the evid of cook ,  Dr. Lieberman said . The extra energi could have help to drive the evolut of larger hominin brain .Dr. Lieberman and Dr. Zink do not dismiss the import of cook . It kill food pathogen , made it possibl to store food longer and destroy toxin . But they argu that the advantag of the cook fire were preced by those of stone tool .It is a veri clever piec of research ,  said William R. Leonard , an anthropologist at Northwestern Univers . I think they make a strong case that cook wa not critical to the transform of earli hominin , he ad .Dr. Wrangham disagre . There is no evid , he said , that hominin actual smash tuber to eat them , nor do ani live hunter-gather engag in the practic .And even if earli hominin did smash uncook tuber , Dr. Wrangham said , he doubt that they got enough nutrit from them to keep a modern human healthi . He point to studi of peopl who eat onli raw food that link the diet to difficulti with pregnanc .The averag woman on a diet like that with incred high-class agricultur food can not have a babi ,  Dr. Wrangham said .Kenneth Sayer , an anthropologist at the Languag Research Center at Georgia State Univers , agre that stone kitchen tool may have play a part in human evolut .But he caution that the energi hominin put into eat went well beyond chew . Food wa not present on a plate ,  he said . Hominin went to great troubl just to acquir someth to eat .Dr. Zink did not disagre . Thi is just one littl step in what hope be some broader bodi of knowledg ,  she said .', 'With protect glass at the readi , skywatch across Southeast Asia and the western Pacif are prepar to wit a total solar eclips .

That becaus each year , between March and June , million of firefli squid transform the water into a galact landscap . Lucki for you , all you need is a reserv to come aboard , your eye and perhap a realli good camera .The firefli squid may bring to mind a lightn bug . But the cephalopod is three inch long and fli through the sea , not the sky . And instead of a singl light on it belli , it ha five around each eye , three each on the tip of two of it arm and even more cover it bodi .The firefli squid creat light via a chemic reaction insid it bodi , the same way a lightn bug doe . The process involv wrangl togeth the dynam duo of bioluminesc , two substanc call luciferin and luciferas . Luciferin sit around wait for luciferas , an enzym that trigger luciferin to do what it doe best  make light .Up close , each squid look like it own constel of green and blue star . Togeth , they form a bright blue nebula of bioluminesc , which is quit clear when the squid emerg from 1,200 feet dure the spring to spawn . Firefli squid onli live for a year . After make babi , they die .Whi the firefli squid glow is not precis known . Theori rang from attract mate to deter predat , but arent total convinc . They also appear to lack the abil to regul their flash in synchron pattern like some firefli . Katsunori Teranishi , who studi the squid bioluminesc at Mie Univers in Japan , ha found that the firefli squid constantli emit a weak light with no appar advantag . But sometim the light shine stronger , like a flashlight , from the squid arm . Thi might scare off nearbi predat , but it could also attract those further away .The light can not activ attract a mate , commun with a mate , and deter a predat ,  Dr. Teranishi said . When press for hi own hypothesi for whi the squid emit light , he suggest we ask the squid themselv .The best time to observ firefli squid is in April , in Toyama Citi , Namerikawa and Uozu Citi , said Osamu Inamura , director of the Uozu Aquarium in Uozu Citi ( where you can find firefli squid in captiv ) .

In Januari and Februari when the lake ha frozen over and abras winter wind have polish the ice , visitor can peer through a window into one of Earth most mesmer natur prison .Over the past coupl of month visit with these gaseou captiv at Abraham Lake  and a number of other locat  have left photograph spellbound , scatter memento of their otherworldli encount all over the Internet .Some year the bubbl are few and hard to find , but thi year they cover the lake , make it look like someth from fiction ,  wrote one of these photograph , Rachel Jone Ross , of her experi at Abraham Lake . I had heard about them befor and seen pictur onlin , but noth would have prepar me for how surreal it feel to walk across thi frozen lake.Curiou comment on the photo that have appear on Instagram under tag such as # methanebubbl or less scientif , # love , have ask how thi can be real . It far from the first time thi question ha emerg  it seem that at some point , everi winter for the past few year , a photo or video of the phenomenon begin to spiral it way across the Internet . Thi year , one of the standout wa an imag taken by Ms. Ross , who figur out how to illumin the lake from below at night .The answer to the how and whi of thi and thi begin with bacteria in the mud at the bottom of the lake munch on dead plant and other organ matter . Thi releas methan ga . As the methan attempt to escap , it bubbl toward the frozen surfac of the lake and get trap beneath the ice .Although the wind which keep the surfac of man-mad Abraham Lake clear have made it a particularli good spot to see the bubbl , thousand of other lake support thi phenomenon accord to Katey M. Walter Anthoni , a scientist at The Univers of Alaska Fairbank . She ha identifi similar pattern at natur and man-mad lake in Minnesota , Wyom , South Dakota , Alaska , Russia , Greenland and beyond . In Canada , Vermillion Lake and Lake Minnewanka in Banff Nation Park bubbl beauti too .Dr. Walter Anthoni studi these bubbl , not becaus of their strike aesthet , but the becaus methan is a power greenhous ga . Warm in the Arctic is caus the once-frozen ground there , known as permafrost , to thaw across million of acr . An immens amount of organ materi is trap in the permafrost , and after it thaw , bacteria can break it down , releas methan or carbon dioxid , depend on how wet the area is . Dr. Walter Anthoni is tri to determin how much the releas of these gase will intensifi global warm .She first happen across the bubbl by accid in Siberia when the lake she wa studi in warmer weather froze over . She told New York Time report Justin Gilli in 2011 :I went out on the ice , thi black ice , and it look like the starri night sky . You could see these bubbl cluster everywher . I realiz  aha !   thi is where all the methan is. ( View a slide show of her at work set bubbl traps. )The increas rapid at which these photo spread through social media ha meant that a wide array of peopl across the globe are learn about them and find their own  potenti precari  way to get up close to the bubbl .It an eeri experi becaus the lake is so clear that you can see down to the bottom ; if there are no crack or bubbl to use as a refer you cant tell how thick the ice is , and it feel as though you could fall through at ani moment ,  wrote Ms. Ross , who is a Ph.D candid in experiment psycholog at the Univers of Calgari .

In mid-Februari the ice begin to thaw , mean it get more danger . Mr. Ernst said Thursday , that as it ha now warm to the point that she no longer could spot ani bubbl .Visitor often wonder of anoth danger : flammabl . When methan final reach the air and mix with oxygen , it can ignit with the spark of a match as you can see in thi video , shot at a lake in Norway in 2014 .

It result from a mutat gene that is pass down from parent to child .If you inherit the mutat gene , Alzheimer will emerg at around age 50  with absolut certainti . Your child ha a 50-50 chanc of suffer the same fate .The revel came as a shock . And so did the next one : The brother learn that there is a blood test that can reveal whether one carri the mutat gene . They could decid to know if they had it . Or not .It a dilemma more peopl are face as scientist discov more genet mutat link to diseas . Often the newli discov gene increas risk , but doe not guarante it .Sometim know can be use : If you have a gene mutat that make colon cancer much more like , for exampl , then frequent colonoscopi may help doctor stave off troubl .But then there are gene that make a dread diseas a certainti : There is no way to prevent it , and no way to treat it .Marti Reiswig , 37 , saw hi father , now in the final stage of Alzheimer , slowli lose hi abil to think , to rememb , to care for himself , or even to recogn hi wife and son .Mr. Reiswig know that if he ha the gene , he ha perhap a bit more than a decad befor the first symptom appear .

From a distanc , it look like just anoth offshor platform , an artifact of the modern industri landscap .But beneath the wave , the Eureka and other rig like it in the area are home to a vast and thrive commun of sea life that some scientist say is one of the richest marin ecosystem on the planet .They are more product than coral reef , more product than estuari ,  said Milton Love , a professor of marin biolog at the Univers of California Santa Barbara . It just turn out by chanc that platform have a lot of anim that are grow realli quickly.Dr. Love , who ha publish research on marin life at offshor drill site , said the locat of these rig  in marine-protect area in a cold current that swoop down from British Columbia  have made them perfect habitat for fish and other sea life .Scientist and diver have been awar of the abund life here for year , but a 2014 paper that Dr. Love co-wrot , publish in Proceed of the Nation Academi of Scienc , confirm what mani expert had alreadi suspect : that most of the life wa actual creat at the rig rather than have come from other part of the ocean and settl around the massiv concret pylon .For some of these major econom speci like the rockfish , there no question that there are more of them out in Southern California water becaus the platform is there ,  Dr. Love said .Thi insight is ad momentum to effort to convert some of these rig into artifici reef onc they are decommiss . Blue Latitud , an organ found in 2014 by two young scientist with degre from the Scripp Institut of Oceanographi in San Diego , is tri to increas awar of the valu of rig as perman home for sea life .I think it time for us to step outsid the box and think creativ about the resourc we have ,  said Amber Jackson , an oceanograph and conserv biologist who co-found Blue Latitud with Emili Callahan , a marin scientist . To lose these ecosystem just becaus they are on an oil platform structur , I feel , is shortsighted.While so-cal rig-to-reef program in the Gulf of Mexico have exist for decad  more than 400 rig have been approv for convers sinc 1985  the idea of leav rig in place as reef is controversi in California . So far , none off the coast of California have been convert into artifici reef .It seen as someth which benefit the oil industri , and oppos the oil industri is the role taken by mani environment group ,  said Georg Steinbach , the execut director of the California Artifici Reef Enhanc program , a nonprofit advocaci organ fund by the oil industri .The Eureka , own by the Houston-bas oil compani Beta Offshor , is one of 27 oil rig off the California coast . Sever major oil spill have occur sinc they were built half a centuri ago , give rise to a passion environment movement that ha long advoc complet remov of the rig .Peopl here have been wait for these oil platform to go away ,  said Linda Krop , an environment lawyer with the Environment Defens Center , an advocaci group base in Santa Barbara , where sever offshor rig can be easili seen from shore .Ms. Krop disagre that the scienc is settl on the role of the rig in foster marin life . Regardless , she said , leav the rig up would be tantamount to reward pollut with the windfal of not have to pay to remov them .When they built those platform , that wa a cost that they took into effect ,  she said .An enorm oil spill in 1969 releas 80,000 to 100,000 barrel of crude , leav a slick over 40 mile of coastlin and kill thousand of anim . The spill wa nation news and gave rise to power anti-dril movement here .Subsequ spill have harden opponents resolv .

I saw what it look like , what it smell like , and it wa heartbreaking.But over the last decad or so , diver and scientist have discov that the rig harbor an unexpect bounti of life . Just beneath the surfac at the Eureka rig , sea lion prowl in the crystal clear water ; half a dozen speci of rockfish and bright orang Garibaldi swim in the swift current ; and florid carpet of invertebr and crustacean cling to the rig pylon .It the most amaz dive that Iv ever done ,  said Ashleigh Palinka , a San Diego-bas conserv biologist who came out to dive the rig last Octob . It like an oasi . The structur itself is realli impress . It give you a sens of total weightlessness.Over the last few year , word ha spread about the pleasur of dive the rig . In 2014 , Ms. Jackson and Ms. Callahan start advoc to allow oil compani to keep larg section of mani of the rig in place after they are no longer function .The process of remov a rig and clean the site , known as decommiss , is complic and expens , and includ plug and cement well to make them safe . A total decommiss mean the remov of the entir structur . In a typic rigs-to-reef effort , onli the top portion of the rig is remov , usual to a depth of about 80 feet , so that they dont pose ani risk to ship hull . The rest of the rig remain in place as a haven for sea life and for recreat dive or fish .California ha a law that allow rig to be convert into reef . In 2010 , then-Gov . Arnold Schwarzenegg sign a bill to allow partial decommiss of rig , but it immedi encount resist from some environment group that consid it too favor to the energi industri .Compani never took advantag of the law anyway , industri expert say , in part becaus they found the law requir too byzantin and oner . Anoth reason wa that until recent , oil price were high enough to justifi keep the rig in place .But that may be chang . And an amend to the 2010 law , seek to streamlin the approv process , wa introduc in the California legislatur last year and will be debat thi year .I think with the current oil-pric scenario , there is an opportun to tri and establish a workabl rigs-to-reef program ,  Mr. Steinbach said , ad that mani rig were near the end of their product live , rais question about their ultim fate .The potenti save to the oil industri from convert all of the rig off California to reef , rather than remov them , could be more than $ 1 billion , by one estim . But under the law , oil compani would be requir to put at least half of the money they save into state coffer to fund conserv program . That ha some group here speak out in favor of the rigs-to-reef program .Nobodi want to see more oil spill ,  said Mari Gleason , the lead scientist for the Natur Conserv in California . But in some case it may make more sens and have more environment benefit if we could do a partial decommiss and use ani cost save to fund more ocean conserv and manag , and fill some of the import fund gap we have in the state to manag ocean resources.', 'On Wednesday , the moon will blot out the sun , creat a total solar eclips that will darken the sky over part of the western Pacif and Southeast Asia .The spectacl will begin on March 9 and finish on March 8 . Ye , truli .That becaus the moon shadow will first fall over part of the Pacif on Wednesday morn local time , and then cross the intern date line and appear visibl on Tuesday afternoon local time .Total solar eclips occur when the darkest part of the moon shadow , the umbra , encas part of the Earth . Anyon stand where the umbra fall will see the moon engulf the sun for about four minut .Thi year , peopl in part of Indonesia , Borneo and Sulawesi within a narrow strip stretch about 90 mile wide  the line of total  will experi a blackout at some point from 7 to 11 a.m. local time . ( The total eclips will occur sometim from midnight G.M.T . ( 7 p.m. Eastern ) to 4 a.m. G.M.T . ( 11 p.m. Eastern ) .The cool thing for those who are go to be in the path of total is that they are go to be abl to see the outer atmospher of the sun call the corona ,  said C. Alex Young , a solar astrophysicist from NASA . The corona will look like flame stream from behind the moon . Thi is onli visibl from the ground dure a total solar eclips ,  he said .Those in Australia , South China , and Southeast Asia as well as Hawaii and Alaska will stand in the shade of a partial solar eclips when the moon second shadow , the penumbra , catch them in it shade . From their perspect , itll look as if some galact giant took a big bite out of the sun .If your one of the billion of peopl who will not see thi year eclips , dont fret ; there are consol prize . The San Francisco Exploratorium will live stream the total eclips from Micronesia on it websit . And Jupit will be at opposit Tuesday , allow stargaz everywher to see the planet at it brightest in the night sky without need a telescop .Final , for those who live in the continent Unit State , the next total solar eclips will pass through the middl of the countri in August 2017 . Total solar eclips occur about onc everi one to two year , the last one be in March 2015 .

What the No . 1 caus of blind in older adult in the Unit State ?A . It sound like a simpl question , but there no perfect answer ,  said Dr. Susan Vital , a research epidemiologist at the Nation Eye Institut of the Nation Institut of Health . It depend on age , how blind is measur and how statist are collected. For exampl , some studi have reli on the self-report answer to the vagu question : Do you have vision problem ? The best avail estim , she said , come from a 2004 paper aggreg mani other studi , some in the Unit State and some in other countri , updat by appli later censu data .Thi paper and other have found strike differ by age and by racial and socioeconom group , Dr. Vital said . In white peopl , she said , the major caus of blind at older age is usual age-rel macular degener , progress damag to the central portion of the retina . In older black peopl , the major caus are like to be glaucoma or cataract . In older peopl of work age , from their 40 to their 60 , the major caus , regardless of race , is diabet retinopathi , damag to the retina as a result of diabet .Mani studi have shown that white peopl are more like to have age-rel macular degener , Dr. Vital said , but as for cataract , for which blind is prevent by surgeri , there are question about access to health care and whether those affect can get the need surgeri . It is not known whi black peopl are at higher risk of glaucoma . There are also some gender differ , she said , with white women more like than white men to becom blind . Studi have not found the same differ by gender in black and Hispan peopl .Becaus mani of the caus of blind at all age are prevent , Dr. Vital said , it is essenti to have regular eye checkup , even if there are no obviou symptom . question @ nytimes.com', 'In 2010 , Elizabeth Wolf , then 30 , wa live in Vermont , work for a nonprofit and happili explor new pursuit , from rais chicken to contra danc .But after sever disturb phone call from and about her parent , Loui and Nanci Brood , she move back into the split-level in Mt .

It did not go well .In a matter of second , power insid the uranium-and-graphit core of the reactor surg out of control , set off a steam explos that wa follow by a fire that spew radioact particl into the atmospher .By offici Soviet account sever dozen plant worker and firefight die in the immedi aftermath . Thousand more were sicken by radiat , over the short and long term . The surround countrysid , contamin by radioact fallout , wa declar off limit to anyon without a pass to get through secur checkpoint .On the 30th anniversari of the accid , access within the 18-mile exclus zone , which includ the abandon citi of Pripyat , is still restrict . But at the plant itself , thing are look up . An arch shelter design to enclos the radioact remain of the destroy reactor is near complet .The arch , call the New Safe Confin , is be built  at a cost of at least $ 1.7 billion  to last 100 year . Insid , the radioact level will be so high that normal mainten , like paint , will not be possibl . So insid and out , the arch is cover in stainless steel , and dehumidifi air will be circul around the structure steel truss to prevent rust .It wa built sever hundr yard from the destroy No . 4 reactor , and later thi year will be slid in place over the reactor build . That will elimin one of the greatest risk that still exist at Chernobyl : a structur collaps that could rais a cloud of radioact dust and spread more contamin across Ukrain and into Western Europ .But it will also mark the start of a new phase in cope with what is gener consid the world worst nuclear power disast . Insid the arch will be a heavi duti crane and other remote-oper equip to be use to start remov the crumbl radioact fuel that remain in Unit 4 .It will not be an easi task . There is a lot of fuel  195 ton , by one estim  along with ton of lead , sand and other materi that were drop on the reactor by helicopt in a desper effort to extinguish the fire . It all melt togeth into a lethal lava-lik substanc that pour through pipe and hole in the structur and solidifi .The govern of Ukrain will be respons for the work , and it is unclear where the money will come from to pay for it , or for a repositori that will be need for the fuel and other highli radioact wast . It may take much more than anoth centuri befor the mess start in a few second 30 year ago is fulli clean up .', 'Mani peopl long to live near water for the pleasur of swim , boat , fish , or just to contempl .But , say Manu Prakash , a scientist at Stanford with broad interest , the surfac of an allur lake or pond , the boundari where water meet air , can be far less invit for certain insect .Water is about 100 time as viscou as air , and insect that live on it surfac must somehow negoti movement in both realm . Most seem to choos one or the other . Some , like long-leg water strider , maintain a small measur of distanc from the water with a cushion of air that let them skate on the surfac . Other , like whirligig beetl , embrac the water and swim .The lili pad beetl , which Dr. Prakash and hi colleagu report on in The Journal of Experiment Biolog , ha evolv a uniqu solut to move in water and air at the same time .It fli , beat it wing for propuls much as it would if it were take off into the air . But it remain tether to the water by claw at the end of it leg that break through the surfac and act as anchor so a strong wing beat wont unexpectedli lift the beetl .The movement is unusu , a bit like windsurf , except that rather than have a sail to catch the wind , the beetl use it wing to gener power .Dr. Prakash run a laboratori devot to project as vari as econom paper microscop , water comput and biophys . He conduct the studi of the lili pad beetl with Haripriya Mukundarajan and Dong Hyun Kim at Stanford and Thibaut C. Bardon of the cole Polytechniqu in Pari . He describ the research as just good old natur histori ,  with a larg dose of physic .It began some year ago when he saw , on a pond , someth that move so fast that I couldnt actual see it. He stay for a coupl of hour tri to track the culprit down and final found the beetl , which eat hole in lili pad and zip from one to the other on the water surfac .He thought it techniqu wa a great way to move around and had a hunch that the physic would be intrigu . And he wa attract , he said , to a creatur that had realli claim thi harsh environment.With high speed video and mathemat analysi of the movement and forc involv , the team made sever discoveri .The beetle leg repel water , which keep it afloat , except for claw at their tip , which penetr the surfac of the water and tie it to the surfac .As the beetl fli , or surf , the up and down forc of it wing and the attach of the claw make the surfac of the water bounc up and down like a trampolin . The tip of the wing almost touch the surfac of the water , and the beetl cope with aerodynam , surfac tension and anoth kind of drag that appear onli when the insect is move faster than about nine inch a second . The beetl actual travel close to a foot a second . It call capillari wave drag .The whole system , Dr. Prakash said , is right at the edg of chao ,  mathemat speak . A chaotic system is one so complic that given the initi condit , one cant predict what is go to happen . One way or anoth , the beetl manag to navig thi environ .The self-pow surf actual demand more energi than fulli airborn flight , which the beetl can also do . It seem to prefer thi sort of locomot . Dr. Prakash said that may be becaus it a good way to find new food sourc , or becaus predat havent figur it out .He said that he and hi colleagu were now turn to a fli that seem to do someth similar but in the sea . There are , of cours , way that one could imagin appli the find to robot , but the research realli wa done , he said , for pure scientif curios .One thing the remark beetl did not evolv is a brake system . In the lab , it run into the edg of a dish and just toppl over . On a pond , Dr. Prakash said , they seem to stop the same way .They hit the leaf ,  he said .', 'Evid ha suggest for some time that sleep depriv can lead to obes , among a host of other ill . Now research are dig into the mechan that caus our sleep-depriv brain to crave food they do not need .A studi publish on Tuesday in the journal SLEEP suggest that the brain receptor that can lead the sleep-depriv to crave unnecessari food were the same as those activ by marijuana . Essenti , not sleep can give you a feroci case of the munchi .The studi took a close look at receptor affect by endocannabinoid  so name for cannabi , the marijuana plant  which it found were close involv in the food crave that come from sleep depriv . Sleep restrict in the study subject led to amplifi endocannabinoid level in the blood , lead to hunger pang , which gener intensifi in the earli afternoon , to increas further .Fourteen healthi , non-obes subject between the age of 18 and 30 particip in the studi . All of the subject particip in both aspect of the studi , undergo four night of either healthi sleep or sleep depriv , after which they were given two regular meal as well as unlimit access to palat snack ,  includ candi , chip with guacamol and salsa , Dorito , Cheeto and ice cream , as well as healthier option such as fruit and yogurt .Subject who were depriv of sleep said that they felt hungrier , and had more troubl control themselv when face with the snack . They end up consum nearli twice as much fat and protein as the control group . ( There wa not a signific differ between the calori consum by each group dure regular meal . ) Previou studi have shown that the sleep-depriv are particularli vulner to food that are high in fat and carbohydr .Identifi the system involv in uncontrol food crave may help scientist develop new area of research that could help peopl har unnecessari eat , the studi said .Just know what system are in play to caus increas hunger and appetit in sleep restrict present a novel avenue for help peopl control those crave , the lead author of the studi , Dr. Erin Hanlon , said in an interview .She agre that a less-than-novel solut  get more sleep  would also help .The endocannabinoid system is involv in variou brain function , includ stress manag , immun respons and pain modul . It ha even been link to the runner high that mani feel after aerob exercis . But the new studi repres the first time that scientist have found the system to be affect by sleep depriv , Dr. Hanlon said .Research suggest that lose sleep slightli increas the body need for calori , but that peopl who are sleep depriv often consum far more than they need .The studi come as American are voluntarili curtail their own sleep , a practic that may correspond to a sharp rise in obes rate over the last sever decad .Between 2005 and 2007 , nearli 30 percent of adult said that they slept six hour or less per day , accord to data from the Nation Health Interview Survey . That an hour less than the minimum amount of sleep recommend for adult .Accord to statist releas by the Center for Diseas Control and Prevent in 2014 , more than two in three American over the age of 20 are either overweight or obes .We got into a kind of rhythm in our cultur where you sleep with the time you have left over ,  Dr. Hanlon said . Wer hope that individu will start to think of adequ sleep as kind of an import aspect of maintain good health , and not just as a byproduct of the day.', 'What could be more alien than a viru ? It a nanobiolog weapon  a microscop protein shell hold a few gene that hijack a cell intern machineri , forc it to make new virus . The battl we fight with these alien enemi bring malais , scar and even death .Yet as foreign as virus may seem , the boundari between us and them is turn out to be remark blurri . We use DNA from virus to do thing that are essenti to our own surviv , scientist are find . Somehow , we have manag to domest some of these invad .A number of virus replic by insert their DNA into our own gene . On rare occas , their gene get pass down to futur gener .At first , the newli acquir gene behav a lot like regular viru gene . They can still coax host cell to make full-fledg virus that can escap and infect other victim .But over the gener , they lose the abil to escap human cell . They can still make copi of themselv , but those copi get incorpor into the host cell DNA . Over time these so-cal endogen retrovirus lose even the abil to replic , becom harmless fragment adrift in the human genom .Endogen retrovirus first invad the cell of our primat ancestor more than 50 million year ago . Scientist have identifi over 100,000 of these fragment in the human genom , account for 8 percent of our DNA .Some of these fragment have becom part of our biolog and perform task that benefit us . A host essenti take over a viral gene and put it to work for it own end ,  said Ari Katzouraki , an evolutionari biologist at the Univers of Oxford .Human cell may have even co-opt viral DNA for a particularli iron purpos : to fight other virus .Twenti year ago , British scientist investig a virus-fight protein call Fv1 . It protect mice by latch onto invad virus and prevent them from insert their DNA into the genom of a mous cell . The gene that encod Fv1 came origin from a mouse-infect viru , the research discov .Other protein produc by viral DNA block the receptor through which newcom virus invad . Some viral protein disrupt the replic of attack virus , leav them unabl to invad other cell .On Thursday in the journal Scienc , scientist report that human ancestor also har viral DNA to rewir their own genet circuitri .Guillaum Bourqu , a geneticist at McGill Univers who wa not involv in the studi , prais it for reveal a new way in which evolut har viral DNA to strengthen the immun system . In that sens , it a first ,  he said .To fight invad virus , a cell need to turn on mani gene at onc . The genet switch that make thi possibl are stretch of DNA next to each gene , which are themselv activ by protein .One such protein is interferon , which is produc when a cell is attack by a viru . Interferon turn on gene that cell use to defend themselv .Cedric Feschott and hi colleagu at the Univers of Utah wonder if our cell har viral gene switch to turn on immun gene . They discov mani piec of viral DNA sit next to gene that belong to the interferon network .The scientist edit the DNA of human cell they grew in a dish , chop out some of the viral switch near interferon-respons gene . Then they expos those cell to interferon . The immun gene , they found , bare woke up .In anoth experi , the team expos the alter cell to virus and found that the cell mount onli a weak defens . They becam more suscept to infect ,  Dr. Feschott said .The result suggest that mani of the gene switch that help defend our cell from virus actual came from virus .Dr. Feschott note that a number of virus that infect human today have gene switch that turn on their gene when they sens their host cell have launch an interferon defens . Such gene switch would have been easili captur by our own cell .The new studi add even more evid of the import of viral DNA in our evolut . By spread their DNA around our genom , virus provid us with new switch that our cell could har .But understand the full effect of virus on our evolut will take year , accord to Dr. Feschott .

The plant , he explain , pull water up from the ground . The water then leak out and hit frost , which caus it to start freez .

The sharpest increas in age have occur sinc 2009 , when the averag wa 25.2 . But there ha been a steadi rise over the past four decad : in 1970 , the mean age of a first-tim mother stood at 21.4 .The main reason for the uptick : the declin of first birth among teenag and the increas of first birth among women over age 30 . Over the 14-year period examin , the proport of first birth to women younger than 20 declin 42 percent , while rise 28 percent among women age 30 to 34 and 23 percent among women 35 and older .Asian or Pacif Island mother had the oldest averag age at first birth , 29.5 , and American Indian or Alaskan Nativ had the youngest , 23.1 . Still , the averag age ha increas across all race and ethnic .At the same time , the averag age increas in everi state and the District of Columbia . The largest increas  1.7 year or more  were note in California , Oregon , Washington , Utah , Colorado and Illinoi . Among the state with the smallest increas were Vermont , New Hampshir , Massachusett , Kentucki and Tennesse .Mother are not just older at first birth . They are also have their babi closer togeth than they did in 2000 . The averag age of the mother at her second birth increas by one year . It wa 0.8 year for third and fourth birth , and 0.5 year for fifth birth and beyond .In 2000 , first and second babi were born an averag of 2.8 year apart . By 2014 , that gap had decreas to 2.4 year .One possibl consequ is that as you delay the birth of the first child , the possibl of have three or more children becom problemat ,  said a co-author of the report , Bradi E. Hamilton , a statistician with the Nation Center for Health Statist . So the longer you postpon , the more potenti you have for smaller famili and smaller popul growth.The report depend on birth certif for it data , which of cours say noth about the reason behind the phenomenon . But a wide cite research in the field , Hans-Pet Kohler , a professor of sociolog at the Univers of Pennsylvania , said that the pattern had been the same in other industri nation , with econom play an import role .There been a rapid increas in delay sinc 2009 , which is appar due to the recess ,  he said . When the econom pictur is uncertain , peopl hold off all sort of commit , and have children is one of them.', 'Invas speci are bad news , or so goe the convent wisdom , encourag by persist warn from biologist about the danger of foreign anim and plant move into new territori .Conserv organ bill alien speci as the foremost threat to nativ wildlif . Citi rip out exot tree and shrub in favor of indigen varieti . And govern spend million on effort to head off or erad biolog invad .I think the domin paradigm in the field is still a when in doubt , kill them sort of attitud ,  said Dov Sax , an associ professor of ecolog and evolutionari biolog at Brown Univers .But a grow number of scientist are challeng thi view , argu that not all invas speci are destruct ; some , they contend , are even benefici . The assumpt that what hail from elsewher is inher bad , these research say , rest more on xenophobia than on scienc .It almost a religi kind of belief , that thing were put where they are by God and that that where they damn well ought to stay ,  said Ken Thompson , an ecologist and retir senior lectur at the Univers of Sheffield in England , who wrote the 2014 book Where Do Camel Belong : Whi Invas Speci Arent All Bad.Wer actual move plant and anim around the world all the time ,  he said . We have been for centuries.Dr. Thompson and other scientist have call for a more nuanc approach to evalu whether the presenc of a speci is harm or benefici . Erad most invas speci is virtual imposs in an era of global , they note . And as climat chang push more speci out of their home rang and into new area , the number of so-cal invad is like to multipli exponenti .Yet the notion that a speci should not be judg on it origin is highli controversi , as Mark Davi , a biolog professor at Macalest Colleg in Minnesota , discov when he and 18 other research submit an articl in 2011 say just that in the journal Natur .The respons wa immedi  and sign by 141 scientist , mani of them specialist in the field known as invas biolog . Their approach , they said , wa alreadi suffici nuanc ,  thank you veri much .Most conserv biologist and ecologist do not oppos nonn speci per se ,  wrote Daniel Simberloff , a professor of environment scienc at the Univers of Tennesse , who led the group that wrote the rebutt . He ad that Dr. Davi and hi colleagu had vastli play down the sever harm that alien speci caus .But in the five year sinc that contenti exchang , the idea that invas speci should be assum guilti until proven innoc ha begun to wane , the shift prompt in part , Dr. Davi specul , by concern over the use of chemic pesticid and the disrupt of landscap caus by mani erad effort .Some alien speci are undeni harm , a fact that neither Dr. Davi nor other who share hi view disput . The fungu that caus chestnut blight , for exampl , decim thousand of tree and chang the American landscap in the earli 1900 . The Zika viru is invad new region , carri by infect mosquito that some say are be driven northward by warmer temperatur . The vampirelik lamprey , sneak into the Great Lake in the 19th centuri , gradual champ it way through the fish popul .Island and mountaintop are especi vulner to damag from invad becaus their nativ speci often evolv in isol and lack natur defens against predat or immun to exot diseas . The brown tree snake , accident transport to Guam , ha virtual elimin the bird popul there .But , Dr. Davi note , all speci have neg impact on someth ,  and the danger , he said , is often exagger .A studi publish Feb. 17 in the journal Biolog Letter , for exampl , conclud that alien speci are the second most common threat associ with speci that have gone complet extinct sinc 1500 A.D .But the studi , Dr. Davi and other expert said , reli on subject judgment about extinct and doe not distinguish between island speci  which are far more vulner  and land or ocean speci .In some instanc , nonn offer clear benefit . In California , for exampl , monarch butterfli prefer to spend their winter in the branch of the eucalyptu , an exot tree transplant to the state more than 150 year ago and view by some as an invas fire hazard . In Spain , non-n crayfish serv as prey for migratori wetland bird , includ some endang speci .And some notori invad can have posit effect . Western state have spent a fortun tri to erad the tamarisk tree , which mani expert believ hog more than it share of water and damag the habitat of nativ speci .But Julian D. Olden , an associ professor in the School of Aquat and Fisheri Scienc at the Univers of Washington , said tamarisk had been found to provid shelter for bird like the southwestern willow flycatch . Some studi have also conclud that the tree water use is not significantli differ from that of other tree speci .The antipathi to foreign plant and wildlif is rel recent . While the distinct between nativ and non-n speci date to the 18th centuri , the term invasion wa first use in a 1958 book  The Ecolog of Invas by Anim and Plant ,  by Charl Elton  that drew on the militarist vocabulari of the post-World War II era .But the monik did not achiev it full derogatori weight until the 1990 and earli 2000 , when academ interest in the subject peak and the number of paper on the subject gener by invas biologist grew proportion .To biologist like Dr. Simberloff , take action to head off alien speci earli on make sens , allow govern to address threat befor invad take firm hold . Non-n speci are far more like to do harm than nativ plant and anim , he argu , ad that the debat wa a phoni controversy.Whether a speci is view as nativ , howev , often depend on when you arriv on the scene . Much of what American eat wa origin import : The hors , an icon of the American West , for exampl , wa reintroduc by the Spanish thousand of year after the origin North American hors becam extinct . Sever state list the honeybe as their state insect . But like mani other state fish , insect and flower , the bee are in fact immigr .In at least one case , a speci that wa long extinct in it nativ rang wa treat as an interlop when it final return home .Beaver were common in Britain until they were hunt to extinct centuri ago . But when a group of the toothi dam builder took up resid along the River Tay in western Scotland sever year ago , local farmer and fishermen greet the anim with hostil , say they pose a threat to farmland and salmon run and were potenti carrier of diseas .Scottish Land and Estat , an organ repres landown , insist that the beavers centuri of absenc from Britain nullifi their resid statu , the Independ report in 2010 .It just silli ,  Dr. Thompson said , of the reaction to the Tay beaver . I dont think we would have end up in thi ridicul situat if we hadnt been so bombard by propaganda about invas species.Often , he and other say , invasion is just anoth word for change. And the onli thing that is certain is that more chang is to come . Alreadi , the flora and fauna of countri around the world are more homogen than they onc were , as global ha , accident or intent , move exot speci from one place to anoth .From bird to plant to fish to mammal , there strong evid that thing are becom more similar ,  Dr. Olden said , liken the phenomenon to the pop up of big-box retail and the loss of mom-and-pop shops.As more speci migrat , new quandari are like to aris . And as the human popul increas , drive more anim and plant toward extinct , a species second home may be the onli one it ha .In a paper publish last month in the journal Conserv Biolog , two scientist in California , Michael P. Marchetti and Tag Engstrom , describ the paradox of speci that are under threat in their nativ rang but are view as invas in other place they have settl .They includ the Monterey pine , endang in California and Mexico but treat as a pest in Australia and New Zealand , and the Barbari sheep , endang in Morocco and other countri but run rampant in the Canari Island and elsewher .Thi is a challeng ,  Dr. Olden said . If we identifi a plant or anim that might not be abl to respond to climat chang , do we roll the dice and intent move that speci northward , or up in elev ? Wer play a littl bit of ecolog roulett here ,  he ad .', 'Thi week , the biologist Edward O. Wilson , professor emeritu at Harvard Univers and recipi of two Pulitz Prize , will publish hi 32nd book , a person exhort to conserv biodivers titl Half Earth : Our Planet Fight for Life.The book offer an improb prescript for the environ : Dr. Wilson suggest that human set asid roughli 50 percent of the planet as a sort of perman preserv , undisturb by man .We spoke for three hour in the cafeteria of the assisted-liv facil in Lexington , Mass. , where Dr. Wilson and hi wife , Iren , have live the past 14 year . Our convers ha been edit and condens for space and clariti .Q . Whi publish thi book now ?A . Becaus a lifetim of research ha magnifi my percept that we are in a crisi with refer to the live part of the environment.W now have enough measur of extinct rate and the like rate in the futur to know that it is approach a thousand time the baselin of what exist befor human came along .Read your book , one sens you felt a great urgenc to write it ?The urgenc wa twofold . First , it onli been within the last decad that a full pictur of the crisi in biodivers ha emerg . The second factor wa my age . Im 86 . I had a mild stroke a coupl of year ago . I thought , Say thi now or never.And what I say is that to save biodivers , we need to set asid about half the earth surfac as a natur reserv . Im not suggest we have one hemispher for human and the other for the rest of life . Im talk about alloc up to one half of the surfac of the land and the sea as a preserv for remain flora and fauna .In a rapidli develop world , where would such a reserv be ?Larg part of natur are still intact  the Amazon region , the Congo Basin , New Guinea . There are also patch of the industri world where natur could be restor and strung togeth to creat corridor for wildlif . In the ocean , we need to stop fish in the open sea and let life there recov . If we halt those fisheri , marin life would increas rapidli . The ocean are part of that 50 percent .Now , thi propos doe not mean move anybodi out . It mean creat someth equival to the U.N. World Heritag site that could be regard as the priceless asset of human . That whi Iv made so bold a step as to offer thi maxim : Do no further harm to the rest of life . If we can agre on that , everyth els will follow . It actual go to be a lot easier than peopl think .Whi ?Becaus mani problem of human occup that we onc thought of as insolubl are take care of themselv . Demograph tell us that the human popul could stabil at about 10 or 11 billion by the end of the centuri .High tech is produc new product and way of live that are congeni to set side more space for the rest of life . Instrument is get smaller , use less materi and energi .Moreov , the intern discours is chang . Im veri encourag by the Pari Climat Accord . I wa excit to see at the time of the Pari meet that a consortium of influenti busi leader conclud that the world should go for net zero carbon emiss . Toward that end , they recommend we protect the forest we have and restor the damag one . That consist with the Half Earth idea .Do you worri that you are risk the reput of a lifetim with such a controversi propos ?Controversi doesnt bother me . In 1975 , when I publish about sociobiolog , I wa attack in mani way . There were mob in Harvard Squar when I wa to give a lectur . I had to be escort to the back of the hall by polic ! I had class interrupt . At Harvard ! And then the idea won out . Today , there widespread agreement : Ye , there is a human instinct and a lot of human behavior is genet . So , I dont think Im risk my reput with Half Earth. All Im do is report good scienc and the experi of research whov describ a biodivers crisi .Do you see yourself as a natur optimist person ?Ye , I think I am optimist . I had a rough childhood : famili breakup in the depth of the Depress . I dont know whi Im an optimist . No , that not true  I do know . Contrari to my childhood , I marri a veri wonder person . That solv a lot . But you know , I had a lot of good break as a young person . At 29 , I wa a tenur professor at Harvard .What would you say have been the happiest moment in your life ?That easi . Explor natur environ , especi in the tropic forest around the world , place like Vanuatu , New Caledonia , the Caribbean . I did a lot of explor when I wa in my 20 . Even then , you could see the ravag visit upon the natur world , and I wa consciou of extinct . At that time , I didnt see it as seriou enough global to requir immedi action . Mayb I saw the flora and fauna of the world as immort .Do you think connect to your own mortal sensit you to the fragil of natur ?I would think a vivid sens of one person mortal is part of the wisdom of old age , which is not overr . You know so much more . In my case , the older I got , the more audaci I got . Now , Im readi to speak out and gambl a bit .', 'Dure a firefight in Afghanistan in 2005 , Armi Cpl .

Yet there wa a gap in hi coverag that came as a shock .By law , the V.A . can not provid in vitro fertil , not even to a veteran like Corpor Wilson whose abil to have children wa impair by an injuri sustain in the line of duti . Doctor have told him and hi fianc , Crystal Black , that in vitro fertil is their onli chanc of conceiv a child . Each attempt cost more than $ 12,000 , and they will have to pay for it themselv .Thank for your servic , but your on your own with thi ,  Corpor Wilson said .In Januari , the Pentagon announc it would begin offer troop a chanc to freez their sperm or egg befor deploy , a nod to the realiti that thousand of soldier sustain injuri that leav them unabl to have children . But despit that step , a 1992 law ban the V.A . from offer in vitro fertil remain in place , forc those soldier to pay for subsequ treatment out of pocket .A few thousand veteran , male and femal , are infertil becaus of injuri sustain in combat or train . Some are paralyz , some have damag to reproduct organ , and some have brain injuri that disrupt the secret of hormon need to produc egg or sperm .Mani veteran are confound to learn that the Defens Depart , which cover servic member while their statu is still activ militari , provid infertil treatment at seven hospit , without charg for those who need it becaus of service-rel injuri . But veri few wound troop are in ani posit to take advantag of that benefit . While in the hospit they still have activ statu until they are medic retir or discharg from the militari , but they are usual in rehabilit and struggl to recov . Onli 20 servic member have taken advantag of the I.V.F . benefit , accord to Defens Depart offici .At that time your not think about kid ,  said Sherman Gillum Jr. , deputi execut director of Paralyz Veteran of America . Have a kid is the least of your worri . You dont even know how your bodi is go to turn out.The Defens Depart is look at how it can provid reproduct technolog like I.V.F . to a wider popul ,  it said in a statement in late Januari , but the idea wa part of a plan , along with increas matern leav , that appli to active-duti servic member , not veteran .An infertil clinic ha offer Corpor Wilson and Ms. Black a discount , and friend have start a GoFundM websit to help pay for the treatment . But Ms. Black said : It veri tax when you have to come up with such a larg amount to even tri to have a famili . The fertil issu aris 100 percent from hi combat-rel injury.Senat Patti Murray , Democrat of Washington , ha been tri for sever year to chang the law . Thi is a wide use medic procedur , and our veteran should have access to it ,  she said . Thi is an issu between the veteran and the spous and their doctor.The V.A . support legisl by Ms. Murray to chang the law , provid that money wa alloc pay for the servic , accord to testimoni last June befor the Senat Committe on Veterans Affair by Dr. Rajiv Jain , a V.A . assist deputi under secretari .It look as if the bill wa head to a vote , but Ms. Murray withdrew it in Juli becaus a group of Republican , led by Senat Thom Tilli , Republican of North Carolina , had ad amend that would have , among other thing , prohibit the V.A . from work with Plan Parenthood and other group that provid fertil servic and perform abort . The amend were a reaction to video releas by anti-abort activist who accus Plan Parenthood of sell fetal bodi part .Ms. Murray ha vow to keep tri . Im never go to give up until we get thi done ,  she said . I believ it is so essenti for these young men and women to know their countri is behind them when they get home , and their dream is not taken away.But for mani coupl , the biolog clock is tick . Ms. Murray acknowledg that for some , who had ask for her help year ago , it is alreadi too late .Armi Staff Sgt . Michel Wager wa injur by a roadsid bomb in Baghdad in 2007 . She lost one leg and had sever damag to the other . She ha sustain fractur vertebra and a brain injuri .Onc I wa at Walter Reed and sort of consciou , sort of understand what wa go on , I realiz that I stop have period immedi ,  Sergeant Wager said .She wa onli 31 , and her menstrual cycl had alway been normal , she said . But the injuri seem to plung her into menopaus , complet with hot flash . Initi , militari doctor reassur her that she would remain fertil . But the chang troubl her , and she sought treatment . Drug prescrib in 2011 brought some irregular period . A doctor told her that if she want children , she should tri to get pregnant as soon as possibl . But she had no partner .Mi option were to pick a donor out of a book ,  she said . I wasnt quit prepar for that.Later , she start a new relationship , and in Octob 2014 becam pregnant . But she miscarri .Wev had babi fever ever sinc ,  she said .But she and her husband have not conceiv again . In a letter written to help explain her condit to the V.A. , her gynecologist said , In my profession opinion , her infertil could like be explain by her traumat injuri that she suffer while serv in Iraq. He went on to say that the brain injuri had probabl caus her to stop menstruat , and that he had refer her to an infertil clinic .Even though the V.A . doe not provid in vitro fertil , Sergeant Wager said she hope it would recogn her infertil as a service-rel injuri and provid compens , which she could use to pay for the treatment she need .Im dumbfound ,  she said . Wer just sort of at the end of our rope here , not sure where to go or where to turn.She and her husband have been see an infertil specialist , pay out of pocket . The clinic donat one attempt at intrauterin insemin a few month ago , but it fail , and the doctor told the coupl that their best bet , probabl their onli one , wa I.V.F . They can not afford it , and are consid borrow the money from a financ compani that lend to coupl have I.V.F . She is now 40 , and time is run out .Wer not the richest peopl , and for someth that not guarante , it a littl bit scari ,  Sergeant Wager said .

Often , patient can perform the maneuv at home .When you tell patient that all you have to do is move your head in a few differ direct , they think your crazi ,  said Dr. John Oghalai , an otolaryngologist at Stanford Univers .But when they find their vertigo gone with a simpl test and a non-pharmacolog treatment , they love it ,  he said .B.P.P.V. , as it known , occur when the tini calcium carbon crystal of your inner ear loosen and migrat into one of the semicircular canal , where their presenc signal the brain that your move when your not .The result spin sensat usual last onli a minut or so , but chang in head posit can bring it on multipl time a day  when you bend down to empti the dishwash , lean back in a dentist chair , or mere roll over in bed . B.P.P.V . can also follow a head injuri . The whirl sometim becom intens enough to caus nausea and vomit .Thi kind of vertigo occur more frequent in older adult , appar becaus the protein coat that hold the crystal in place weaken with age . Like an old Post-it note , after 60 or 70 year the sticki wear off ,  said Dr. Carol Foster , an otolaryngologist who direct the Balanc Laboratori at the Univers of Colorado Hospit .Merci , the dizzi often resolv on it own within a few day or a coupl of week . That also make it difficult to calcul how mani peopl suffer from vertigo , sinc some never seek treatment or get a correct diagnosi if they do .When Dr. Oghalai and hi colleagu evalu 100 patient who came to a geriatr clinic at Baylor Colleg of Medicin over two week , none of whom had previous report dizzi , they found that 9 percent had undiagnos B.P.P.V . Balanc expert think it is even more widespread .Though the vertigo itself isnt danger , the Baylor studi found that patient who had it were more like to fall , which can caus seriou injuri , and were less abl to handl daili activ like bath and dress . They were also more like to have receiv a depress diagnosi .If the vertigo persist , it can be veri debilit ,  said Dr. Susan Herdman , professor emerita of rehabilit medicin at Emori Univers . Some patient come in feel so unsteadi that they are hold onto wall and furnitur , or even use a wheelchair .On averag , patient with thi disord have alreadi visit five other physician befor they arriv at Emory Dizzi and Balanc Center , Dr. Herdman said .Along the way , they may have undergon lot of expens , unnecessari test . They may also have been take prescript anti-nausea drug for month , or even year , which may slow the perceiv spiral but dont stop the vertigo .What doe stop it , an estim 90 percent of the time , is canalith reposit , also known as the Epley maneuv , after the Oregon ear surgeon who devis it in 1980 . Thi is a simpl mechan disord ,  said Dr. Foster , who ha perform the maneuv thousand of time . You can fix it in minutes.The therapist first confirm the benign paroxysm posit vertigo ( there are mani other kind ) by turn your head from one side to anoth while look for a characterist eye movement call nystagmu .The Epley maneuv also involv turn your head in sever posit while your sit , then lie on your side . The process is quick , gener take less than five minut .Graviti allow the inner ear crystal that have shift to float back into place . Practition sometim must repeat the maneuv or use relat one . The treatment can bring on vertigo in itself , and patient sometim report feel a bit off-bal for a day or two afterward .Usual , howev , theyr startl to find that the spin ha stop .It wa amaz ,  said Ora Larson , 76 , who live in St. Paul . She had taken anti-nausea drug for year after her first bout of B.P.P.V . in the 1970 .A decad later , Mrs. Larson wa experienc vertigo again and happen to read a newspap articl about the Epley maneuv . She drove 65 mile to a hospit that offer it . I wa will to tri anyth ,  she said .She had immedi relief then , and continu to head for a clinic when the vertigo threaten to reappear . It so noninvas and so easi ,  she said . You dont even have to put on a gown.Dr. Foster ha develop an addit maneuv for home use , call the half-somersault , that is done kneel on the floor . Mr. Amberg found it onlin and report that it work stunningli well.Dr. Foster initi trial with 68 patient use it at home show that the half somersault wa as effect as a self-administ Epley , but it still so new that studi replic her result havent been publish .The Epley itself ha onli been wide practic for about 20 year . Some medic profession clearli dont know about it  or even recogn B.P.P.V . Frustrat specialist believ that ten of thousand of older adult endur it miseri without learn that there a safe , accept , low-cost way to make the world stop twirl around them .Sometim , health care provid say , Your just get older ,  said Courtney Hall , a research and physic therapist at Jame H. Quillen V.A . Medic Center in Mountain Home , Tenn. But feel dizzi isnt a normal part of aging.', 'A cheetah known as Chewbaaka ha help scientist time-travel through that species long , complex histori , even provid some clue about how the big cat becam the world fastest land anim .Chewbaaka , rescu as a 10-day-old orphan in Namibia , becam an ambassador anim for the Cheetah Conserv Fund there . ( Hi name is a variat of the Star Wars character . ) He die five year ago at the advanc age of 16  twice the life span of the averag cheetah in the wild  but not befor geneticist drew hi blood . Along with blood sampl from six other cheetah from Namibia and East Africa , hi ha now been use to sequenc the species complet genom  it full set of chromosom .With their spot coat and black teardrop facial mark , cheetah are a favorit of tourist on photograph safari . The anim race across the African savanna at speed close to 60 mile per hour becaus of their uniqu physiolog : elong leg , aerodynam skull , enlarg adren gland and heart muscl , and claw that grip the earth like footbal cleat . Consid critic endang , cheetah number onli about 10,000 today , with most live in southern and eastern Africa .What the genom analysi reveal is not encourag : The cheetah ha less than 5 percent of the genom divers of other wild cat , a level much lower than even inbr domest dog and cat and the lowest among the 30 mammal whose genom have been sequenc . Genet divers in an anim is determin by variat in enzym gene inherit by an animal two parent and is critic to it healthi reproduct and immun to diseas .Scientist began to suspect that the cheetah wa genet monotonous sever decad ago . Surgic skin graft done experiment among unrel cheetah were toler without the normal rate of tissu reject , as if all the anim were ident twin . Cheetah in captiv were difficult to breed and had unusu high mortal rate among the cub . And the anim show high vulner to outbreak of diseas .Recent , scientist at the Theodosiu Dobzhanski Center for Genom Bioinformat at St. Petersburg State Univers in Russia collabor with BGI-Shenzhen in China and the Cheetah Conserv Fund to analyz the entir genom of the speci . The 35-member team , led by Pavel Dobrynin and Stephen OBrien , both of the Dobzhanski Center , figur out the specif underpin of the cheetah genet impoverish and glimps the evolutionari chain of event that produc it unparallel run speed . The research wa publish in the journal Genom Biolog .The three-million-year-old tale of the cheetah is punctuat by two major event that greatli reduc the animal genet divers . The fossil record show that the first occur about 100,000 year ago , when cheetah inhabit North America alongsid their cousin the puma . At that time , cheetah began migrat across the Bere Strait into Asia , and ultim into Africa , produc a seri of popul bottleneck . Number of the anim drop so low that they were forc to practic inbreed to surviv . Then , late in the Pleistocen epoch , a global extinct event caus cheetah popul to crash . Cheetah again resort to inbreed , bare escap extinct .By home in on a seri of mutat that occur on a known timet , the intern team of geneticist calcul exactli when these popul bottleneck occur , confirm that they coincid with the two ancient event and pinpoint the second , Pleistocen bottleneck , 11,084 to 12,589 year ago .The reason cheetah toler skin graft also crystal for the research . An import cadr of gene that mediat graft reject wa near uniform across differ cheetah ,  Dr. OBrien said . All cheetah test had actual disarm four of these key gene entirely.In addit , the sequenc of the genom illumin gene mutat that probabl explain the sperm abnorm seen in all cheetah today . Gene AKAP4 , known to regul sperm develop in human , show remark signatur of natur select becaus of 10 mutat , five of them like to block normal sperm develop .But what make the cheetah run ? For thi function , natur select wa on the animal side . Eleven differ gene show evid of mutat occur over gener that boost the animal muscl contract , stress respons and regul of energy-releas process , all of which beef up the big cat run prowess .Despit the genet deck be stack against them , cheetah in Africa ralli over the centuri from their popul crash , at one point number hundr of thousand . Today , though , with onli about 10,000 remain , they face even more seriou threat in their dwindl home territori : loss of habitat and frequent fatal conflict with human .The cheetah is the poster speci for genet impoverish , but also a success stori ,  Dr. OBrien said . With some conserv help from peopl , they should be abl to surviv their genet disadvantages.And for that , they owe Chewbaaka a debt of gratitud .Chewbaaka wa truli an amaz cheetah , and veri famou , so it seem onli fit that hi biolog sampl provid the basi for the genom studi ,  said Lauri Marker , an author of the paper and founder and execut director of the Cheetah Conserv Fund .Move forward , all other cheetah genom sequenc will be compar to hi ,  she said . Similar to hi namesak in the Star Wars movi  a Wookie is a give creatur by natur  Chewbaaka will continu to give back to hi species.', 'Call it The Buzz Dead. Infest of what scientist have dub zombi bees have spread across both the West and East coast in recent year .The honeybe hord , while not actual undead , are the unwil host to a parasit infect that research think drive the drone to act errat , or zombielik ,  in the moment befor they die .To better understand the parasit swarm , John Hafernik , an entomologist at San Francisco State Univers ha recruit peopl countrywid to join hi hunt .The big question for us wa , I thi a San Francisco thing ?  Or someth that is take place all over the countri that ha not been notic by biologist befor ,  he said .Sinc he began the project four year ago , he ha conclud the answer is the latter . Volunt have help identifi infect honeybe in California , Washington and Oregon as well as Vermont , Pennsylvania and New York . More than 800 bee observ have been upload to the ZomBe Watch onlin databas .Dr. Hafernik first discov someth eeri wa happen to the bee on hi campu in 2008 when he stumbl upon sever of them stagger in circl along the sidewalk . For week he pick a few up and place them in a glass vial with plan to feed them to hi pet pray manti .One day he came across a vial he had forgotten on hi desk for a coupl of week . The bee insid were dead , but the vial wa overwhelm with small brown fli pupa . He came to the realiz that the bee were parasit .After further explor across San Francisco Bay , he and hi colleagu found sever bee that were also behav strang . They would fli from their hive at night , which wa someth bee would normal never do , and then circl around a light fixtur . After their nocturn danc the bee would drop to the ground and start walk strang . They were succumb to their overlord , larva of the fli Apocephalu boreali .The life cycl of the parasit fli is straight from a horror stori . The femal fli use someth call an ovipositor , which is like a hypoderm needl , to inject her egg into the abdomen of the honeybe .About a week later the larva lurk within the abdomen wriggl into the bee thorax and start liquefi and devour it wing muscl . Then , like in the movi Alien ,  they burst through the bee bodi , erupt from the soft space between it head and shoulder area .A far as we know thi is a death sentenc ,  Dr. Hafernik said . We dont know ani bee that have surviv be parasit by these maggots.As mani as 80 percent of the hive that Dr. Hafernik examin in San Francisco Bay had been infect . Understand more about how the infect spread is import , he said , becaus although the infest are not the main driver behind honeybe declin across the countri , they could help collaps an alreadi vulner coloni .', 'For a few week in Februari if the condit are just right , for about 10 minut around sunset , one waterfal in Yosemit Nation Park look more like it opposit  a firefal .Visitor who flock to the California park last week , mani with camera in tow , have not been disappoint by the glow transform of Horsetail Fall , which flow from El Capitan .In the over 20 year I have been photograph the firefal and lead workshop there in Yosemit , I have never seen a more spectacular one ,  said Michael Mariant , a photograph from Morro Bay , Calif. , who lead teach trip to Yosemit .The phenomenon occur if there ha been enough snow and rain in the Sierra Mountain to fuel the waterfal , if the sky are clear and if the set sun strike the water at an angl that creat the illus of lava .Mike Gauthier , the park chief of staff , said that he wa not sure if it wa definit the best firefal ever .

So , she said , she wa use to them perform well on test of think abil .But when she first tri them on someth call an A-not-B test , she said , They were absolut terrible.The test is not that difficult . It like a simplifi version of the shell game for anim .

Last week Dr.. Stajic , 66 , file a lawsuit against the citi , claim she had been forc into retir last year in part becaus of a disagr with her superior over the accuraci of certain DNA test .There is more at stake here than Dr. Stajic retir . The cutting-edg techniqu at the center of thi legal disput , call low copi number DNA analysi , ha transform not just polic work , but also a rang of scientif field includ cancer biolog , in vitro fertil , archaeolog and evolutionari biolog . Yet some of the technique applic have trigger scientif controversi .The medic examiner offic ha becom a strong advoc for the techniqu . It is the onli public lab in the Unit State that use low copi number DNA to develop profil for use in crimin case . But expert have long warn that investig must take particular care in interpret these test : analyz so few DNA molecul can lead to error .When scientist first began deciph DNA in the 1970 , they need larg amount , becaus the chemic process that were involv destroy most of the sourc materi .In 1983 , the NobelPrize-win biochemist Kari Mulli sped up the process with a kind of photocopi machin for DNA call polymeras chain reaction , or PCR . Dr. Mulli show the world how to make million of copi of ani particular genet fragment .PCR made it possibl for scientist to work with DNA in smaller sampl , sinc they could now make more of it . Over the past four decad , research have come up with way to run ever-more-sensit test . In the most extrem of these , expert can reconstruct the entir genom use DNA fragment extract from a singl cell .Similar test allow scientist to studi DNA from fossil date back thousand of year . Over time , genet materi in fossil degrad until it becom scarc . Yet scientist onli need to rescu trace amount for analysi .We can be down to 10 or 20 molecul ,  said Brian Kemp , a geneticist at Washington State Univers , who regularli extract DNA from tini fish vertebra more than 10,000 year old .Scientist have found a number of way to make their test more sensit . For instanc , Dr. Kemp and hi colleagu have discov that collagen and other compound found in fossil can slow down the PCR process . By care remov those chemic , they are abl to make more copi of ancient DNA .But the more sensit DNA test becom , the greater the risk that they will yield the wrong result . Even stray bit of DNA  from a lab worker skin cell or an airborn fungal spore  may contamin the test equip .When scientist then run PCR reaction , they may make million of copi of the contamin DNA along with the genet materi they want to studi . Even a littl contamin can skew result .Scientist have develop mani safeguard to prevent contamin . Stephen R. Quak , a biologist at Stanford Univers , and hi colleagu have shrunk down the equip they use , so that there is less room for contamin cell to invad .Whatever float around in a test tube , your go to have a thousand time less of it ,  Dr. Quak said , refer to the miniatur setup .Like other scientist , forens research also are use less and less DNA . Now investig can get usabl genet materi just by wipe gun grip or other surfac for a few loos skin cell .But low copi DNA analysi can detect a mix of DNA from more than one person , and it can be hard to tell which of them is relev to a crime .Mayb there not three peopl bleed on a steer wheel , but there are three peopl touch it ,  said Kirk E. Lohmuel , a geneticist at the Univers of California , Lo Angel . Befor , you didnt have to worri about that.Peopl can even leav DNA trace on object they havent touch . In the Januari issu of The Intern Journal of Legal Medicin , German research vividli illustr thi problem .They rub a cloth on people neck , and then gave the cloth to a second group of peopl . The second group rub their hand on the cloth , pick up the DNA from the first group , then handl a plastic bag or a cotton cloth .When the scientist examin the bag and cloth , they found DNA from the first group of subject about 40 percent of the time .Low copi number DNA analysi can also give incorrect result when it push PCR chemistri beyond it limit . There can be so few DNA molecul float around in a test tube that they simpli dont bump into the PCR chemic need to replic them . As a result , some of the origin DNA may go undupl .Thi failur can yield a genet profil that doesnt match the sourc of the DNA .Each of us carri two copi of everi gene . Sometim the copi are ident , but not alway . If a suspect ha two differ version of a gene and PCR duplic just one , then a forens scientist may conclud both copi are ident .Thi error , call allel drop-out , doesnt mean that low copi number DNA is useless . Statistician are develop method to calcul the reliabl of PCR result for each gene . Those method should help investig figur out how confid to be in their overal analysi .Last Juli , defens lawyer in a Brooklyn murder trial challeng DNA evid that came from a bicycl handl . They offer testimoni from expert who critic the medic examiner method , such as the way they calcul the odd of allel drop-out . The judg threw out the DNA result .Bruce Budowl , the execut director of the Institut of Appli Genet at the Univers of North Texa Health Scienc Center , serv as an expert wit for the defens . ( Hi fee wa put toward hi university program for student stipend . ) Despit deliv harsh critic of the medic examiner offic on the stand , he see a lot of promis in low copi number DNA analysi .He use it in hi own research , which includ identifi remain of Civil War soldier and skeleton discov in Deadwood , S.D . And Dr. Budowl , like other expert , is work on new method to improv the technique sensit .The problem , he said , is that crimin investig leav far less room for error .Im not pleas with what been done with low copi number in forens to date ,  he said .

When he woke up to find he wa still aliv , he overdos on heroin .At a boot camp for troubl teenag , he said , staffer beat him and withheld food . After he refus to climb a mountain in a team-build exercis , they strap him to a gurney and drag him up themselv .The young man in the psychiatrist offic paus , tear slide down hi cheek .Sound like a prison camp ,  Dr. Willenbr said softli , lean forward in hi chair to pass a box of tissu .He began explain the neurosci of alcohol and drug depend , 60 percent of which , he said , is attribut to a person genet makeup . Listen intent , the young patient seem reliev at the idea that hi previou failur in rehab might reflect more than a lack of will .Dr. Willenbr , 66 , ha repeat thi talk hundr of time . But while scientif unassail , it is not what patient usual hear at addict treatment center .Rehabilit program larg adher to the 12-step principl of the 80-year-old Alcohol Anonym and it offshoot , Narcot Anonym . Addict have a moral and spiritu defect , they are told ; they must abstain from alcohol and drug and surrend to a higher power to escap substanc abus .Thi treatment is typic deliv through group therapi led by counselor whose main qualif is their own complet of the program . In some state , drug counselor with onli a high school degre may treat patient , accord to a 2012 studi by the Nation Center on Addict and Substanc Abus at Columbia Univers .Dr. Willenbr say he believ thi approach ignor the most recent research on the subject , a judgment he is well qualifi to make . From 2004 to 2009 , he wa the director of treatment research at the Nation Institut for Alcohol Abus and Alcohol , and he oversaw dozen of studi prove the efficaci of medic and new behavior therapi to treat drink problem .But he grew frustrat at the failur of most tradit rehabilit facil to take advantag of the find .The taxpay had paid for them ,  he said of the studi , but nobodi wa pay attention.When the Nation Heart , Lung , and Blood Institut , anoth feder research facil , publish a major studi on blood pressur , he said , cardiologist and other physician in the field often move quickli to integr the new drug or behavior approach into their practic .But the $ 35-billion-a-year treatment industri ha prove far more resist .When the fact chang  and theyv chang a lot  the mind have not ,  Dr. Willenbr said .When we publish studi in our field , nobodi who is run these center read them . If it counter what they alreadi know , they discount them ,  he continu . In the addict world , the knee-jerk respons is typic , We know what to do.

The Afford Care Act cover treatment for alcohol- and substance-abus disord , but mani who need it fear they will be stigmat if they ask for help .Mani peopl in need of treatment believ that the onli way to recov is to spend time at a rehab facil , which can cost as much as $ 50,000 a month . Yet there is no reliabl evid that intens inpati treatment is more effect than continu outpati care , Ann M. Fletcher , the author of the 2013 expos of the treatment system , Insid Rehab ,  said in an interview .Dr. Willenbr found hi outpati center , Alltyr , in St. Paul in 2012 . Instead of spiritu confess , he reli on a rang of behavior therapi to help patient identifi the trigger that lead to riski behavior . They includ motiv interview , in which therapist ask a seri of question intend to help client understand whi they drink or use drug , and cognit behavior therapi , short-term counsel that help patient recogn and avoid high-risk situat .Dr. Willenbr also treat patient for depress , anxieti and post-traumat stress disord , which can make recoveri from addict difficult . He prescrib medic to reduc alcohol crave , along with Suboxon to elimin opioid crave and block their high . And he train rel to support their love one with kind and compass , not ultimatum .The first year of treatment cost roughli $ 2,600 ; it decreas afterward .A gentl man with a trim beard , gray buzz cut and green-fram glass , Dr. Willenbr wa rais in the rug Iron Rang of northern Minnesota . An avid skier and cyclist , he ha been marri to Kate Meyer , an artist and hi busi partner , for 37 year , and they have two son . He ha an eclect style : He pair John Varvato suit with cowboy boot , and hi offic speaker pipe in blue and hip-hop .Most of Alltyr 500 patient have mild to moder alcohol-us disord and want to tri to curb their habit befor they are out of control . But some have been on a long , tangl journey to multipl treatment program .I dont want anybodi to have to go through the crap I had to ,  said Joe Karkoska , 32 , an elder care worker . Mr. Karkoska said he had tri 10 rehab clinic befor he found Alltyr . Dr. Willenbr prescrib Suboxon , the drug Mr. Karkoska credit for hi not have taken opioid for three year .Dr. Willenbring embrac of medic for those who struggl with addict is anathema to mani involv in tradit recoveri program . Onli about 2 percent of American with alcohol-us disord are ever prescrib anti-crav medic , accord to John Bowersox , a Nation Institut for Alcohol Abus and Alcohol spokesman .The major of those addict to heroin or prescript painkil do not receiv methadon or Suboxon , Dr. Willenbr and other expert said , despit evid of their effect .Dr. Willenbr is adam that for mani , such drug are crucial for a safe recoveri . Long-term use of opioid can halt the brain mechan for produc it own painkil chemic , he said ; without replac drug , mani user remain in continu discomfort .In abstinence-bas rehab , user are detox and lose their toler for drug , he said  but they do not lose the crave . So what do they do when they get out ?  he said . They use the same amount as they did befor and die of an overdose.Dr. Willenbr support open-end , long-term drug-replac therapi for hi patient with opioid-us disord . That rais eyebrow among those who favor abstin . John Johnston , a counselor at Seren Lane , a treatment center in Eugen , Ore. , said that although the drug could help prevent overdos , they did not address the core caus of addict .Substitut one drug for anoth is an extern solut for an intern problem ,  Mr. Johnston said . Dr. Willenbring approach depriv hi patient of the opportun to have a full rang of emot experi , a chang of spiritu perspect and a return to an improv qualiti of life.But for mani of Dr. Willenbring patient , Suboxon ha been instrument in help to find just that . Most , like Kyle Larsen , a 23-year-old nurs student from Albert Lea , Minn. , began misus opioid after they were prescrib for sport injuri or oper .He found Alltyr after a stint at Hazelden Betti Ford and anoth in a so-cal sober-liv facil . It wa one-size-fit all , except that it didnt fit ,  Mr. Larsen said .Suboxon , he said , ha elimin hi crave , allow him to regain the equilibrium he need to return to school and to restor hi family trust . Like mani of Dr. Willenbring patient , Mr. Larsen attend a regular Suboxon group , which cost $ 100 a session and is offer to those who have been on a sustain , stabl dose for mani month . ( They must submit urin sampl to check for recreat drug use . )The meet offer a forum for patient to discuss struggl and success cope strategi , as well as the camaraderi some studi have found to be support in drug- and alcohol-us recoveri .Despit be in addict program for year , mani patient have never been treat effect for depress , anxieti or other emot disord .Mr. Karkoska , for exampl , began have sever social anxieti when he wa in elementari school . He discov opiat as a young adult , and they help blunt hi fear . Yet the repeat instruct he receiv in rehab  to do the steps and call hi sponsor when he had crave  did littl to eas the panic that return whenev he stop shoot heroin .Some year ago , one doctor prescrib high dose of the anti-anxieti medic clonazepam , which help a littl . But I realli didnt have ani idea how to calm myself down otherwis ,  Mr. Karkoska said .Sinc he began take Suboxon , he ha work with Ian McLoon , an Alltyr therapist , to learn breath exercis and cognit behavior techniqu that help identifi and chang unhelp , irrat belief . They have help him cut down on clonazepam , overcom hi fear of group and work .Iv got peopl depend on me now ,  he said . Im a part of my community.The group convers doe not steer away from somber topic : friend who have overdos ; sad breakup , suicid thought and job disappoint . But member encourag one anoth , and there are moment of leviti , too .Dan Bolmgren , an aspir Minneapoli filmmak who tri 12 rehab program from Antigua to Utah , mention that he had smoke a lot of marijuana the past week . Dr. Willenbr made a theatric gasp : Oh no , not weed ! Thi is a critic , and controversi , aspect of Dr. Willenbring approach to opiat addict : He toler the casual use of drug such as marijuana and alcohol . Overdos , he argu , are the biggest threat .In here , we focu on the drug that can kill you ,  he told Mr. Bolmgren , 30 . The onli way weed is go to do that is if a bale of it fall on your head.Some specialist question Dr. Willenbring toler for marijuana and alcohol use among patient who have misus opioid . Dr. Willenbr describ the notion of cross-addiction  the chanc that a person with alcohol-us disord will develop , say , an opioid problem  as overblown , and point to a larg 2014 JAMA studi that found it unlik .But Dr. David Sack , an addict psychiatrist who is the presid and chief execut of Element , a California-bas chain of treatment center , disagre , caution that cannabi or alcohol use could undermin the efficaci of Suboxon treatment .Alcohol and marijuana are real drug ,  he said . Peopl enjoy their live most fulli when they use the fewest amount of substanc . Whi wouldnt we want to maxim that potenti ? Dr. Sack said that he support the use of Suboxon and methadon , but ad that their success rate , which are difficult to track , are oversold .Still , their use is becom more mainstream . The Hazelden Betti Ford Foundat , long a bastion of 12-step care , ha been offer patient Suboxon and extended-releas naltrexon , anoth drug that block the high of opioid , sinc 2013 .Dr. Willenbr did not set out to be an addict psychiatrist . Dure hi resid at the Univers of California , Davi , in the late 1970 , fellow resid were clamor for grant money to studi psychotherapi . Hi mentor direct him to an even larger set of Nation Institut of Health fund to studi effect treatment for complex patient , includ medic ill veteran who were also alcohol depend .Quickli , he becam an expert in a field that had attract rel few research and wa neglect by gener practition , who often have bias against patient with alcohol- and substance-us disord .Inde , few medic school student ever learn about addict , and onli a small percentag of physician are specif train to treat them , said Kathryn Cates-Wessel , the execut director of the American Academi of Addict Psychiatri .By the earli 1980 , Dr. Willenbr wa treat patient with sever drink problem at the Depart of Veteran Affair hospit in Minneapoli . Most had dire live circumst but aspir to convent live : a wife , children , two car in the driveway .They were in the deep , deep hole of addict ,  Dr. Willenbr said . And the tradit approach to treatment  just work thi program and youll dig yourself out  wasnt working.One night while walk hi dog in a snowstorm , Dr. Willenbr wonder whi so few of hi patient were abl to abstain from drug and alcohol . Most peopl with alcohol and substanc use disord need month or year to achiev stabl recoveri .But they were seldom treat as if they had a chronic ill . If you went to a doctor dure your first bout with asthma , would you expect to be cure after just one inhal ?  he said . Of cours not . Whi not approach addict the same way ? These day , Alltyr is expand , recent ad a second psychiatrist to it staff of three therapist and a nurs . Dr. Willenbr said he saw treatment of addict move toward the mainstream of evidence-bas medicin .Befor Prozac ,  he said , nobodi thought a depress person could get well outsid a mental hospit .

Perhap becaus of what the author demur call the dogs long-last coital tie  the half an hour or so that a male and femal are lock in intercours , tear genit tissu and provid the cancer cell with a leisur cross . )Normal a cancer evolv in a singl bodi over the cours of year or decad , accumul the mutat that drive it to power . But to have surviv for millennium , research have propos , canin cancer cell may have develop mechan  like those in healthi cell  to repair and stabil their own malign genom .Earli on , cancer cell typic flourish by disabl DNA repair and ramp up the mutat frenzi . Somewher along the way , the age-old canin cell may have reinvent the devic to extend their own longev . There is also specul that thi cancer may have learn to somehow modifi canin sexual behavior in way that promot the disease spread and surviv .The second kind of contagi cancer wa discov in the mid-1990 in Tasmanian devil , which spread malign cell as they tri to tear off one another face . Though it may be hard to sympath , devil facial tumor diseas threaten the creatur with extinct .With so few exampl , transmiss cancer ha been easi to dismiss as an aberr . But in Decemb , scientist at the Univers of Tasmania and Cambridg report in Proceed of the Nation Academi of Scienc that Tasmanian devil are pass around anoth kind of cancer  genet distinct from the first . It weird enough that one such cancer would aris in the speci . What are the chanc that there would be two ?One theori is that the anim are unusu vulner . Driven so close to extinct  by climat chang , perhap , or human predat  the speci is lack in genet divers . The cell of anoth devil inject through a viciou wound may seem so familiar that they are ignor by the recipient immun system . If some of the cell carri the mutat for the facial cancer , they might be free to flourish and develop into a new tumor .But the scientist also propos a more disturb explan : that the emerg of contagi cancer may not be so rare after all . The possibl ,  they wrote , warrant further investig of the risk that such diseas could aris in humans.Cancer ha probabl exist ever sinc our first multicellular ancestor appear on Earth hundr of million of year ago . The life span of even the longest-liv anim may be just too brief for cancer to easili evolv the abil to leap to anoth bodi . Otherwis , contagi cancer would be everywher .For now , at least , it remain a curios . Consid the case of a 41-year-old man in Medellin , Colombia , who wa examin by doctor in 2013 becaus of fatigu , fever and weight loss . Hi lymph node were clog with cancer cell that had also spread to hi lung and liver .Yet the cell look far too small and simpl to be human . Thi case pose a diagnost conundrum ,  the doctor wrote in Novemb in The New England Journal of Medicin .The solut to the puzzl came when the man wa also found to be harbor a tapeworm call Hymenolepi nana . Further analysi conclud that the cancer cell had origin in the parasit and then metastas through the man bodi .There is no reason to think that tapeworm cancer is about to becom a threat to public health . The patient immun system had been compromis by H.I.V. , and he die sever month later .But natur is infinit in it surpris .', 'Rise emiss of carbon dioxid creat twin threat for coral in ocean around the world : warmer temperatur , which can caus mass bleach , and ocean acidif , which can hinder the animals abil to build reef .But a new studi publish on Friday in the journal Scienc Advanc suggest that ocean acidif may be the bigger worri in some water .Studi a chain of remot Australian island in the Indian Ocean , research found that more acid water ( those that have absorb more atmospher carbon dioxid ) caus seriou skelet deform in juvenil coral in subtrop water .Use 3-D imag techniqu , they saw that young coral from the Houtman Abrolho island develop skeleton that were miss section or had veri porou and fragil surfac .Other studi have shown similar effect of ocean acidif , but the research also discov someth that had not been seen in earlier studi of tropic coral develop  higher temperatur didnt have a neg effect on coral skeleton format .In fact , warmer temperatur seem to lessen the effect of carbon dioxid .Speak from the Philippin , Taryn Foster , the study lead research and appar island-hopp , offer a possibl reason for the posit effect of higher temperatur : Juvenil coral move a lot , sometim hundr of kilomet , so they might need to withstand a rang of temperatur in their life cycle.But even if warmer temperatur arent a problem for coral in the subtrop , the effect of ocean acidif are still worrisom , Dr. Foster said , becaus young coral help reef maintain genet divers and recov after damag event .Howev , she wa cautiou about the implic for global reef develop : Thi is onli one speci of coral , and we think thi is uniqu to the subtropics.', 'A babi with a shrunken , misshapen head is sure a heartbreak sight . But reproduct health expert are warn that microcephali may be onli the most obviou consequ of the spread of the Zika viru .Even infant who appear normal at birth may be at higher risk for mental ill later in life if their mother were infect dure pregnanc , mani research fear .The Zika viru , they say , close resembl some infecti agent that have been link to the develop of autism , bipolar disord and schizophrenia .Schizophrenia and other debilit mental ill have no singl caus , expert emphas in interview . The condit are thought to aris from a combin of factor , includ genet predisposit and trauma later in life , such as sexual or physic abus , abandon or heavi drug use .But ill in utero , includ viral infect , are thought to be a trigger .The consequ of thi go way beyond microcephali ,  said Dr. W. Ian Lipkin , who direct the Center for Infect and Immun at Columbia Univers .Among children in Latin America and the Caribbean , I wouldnt be surpris if we saw a big upsw in A.D.H.D. , autism , epilepsi and schizophrenia ,  he ad . Wer look at a larg group of individu who may not be abl to function in the world.Research in Brazil are investig thousand of report of microcephal birth . While there is no solid proof that Zika viru is the caus , virologist studi the outbreak strongli suspect it .Although the viru wa discov in 1947 , there ha been no research into it long-term consequ . Scientist are left to draw infer from what is known of similar infect .In interview , psychiatr research special in fetal develop agre with Dr. Lipkin pessimist prognosi .A viral attack earli in pregnanc can kill a fetu or stunt the grow brain , produc microcephali , they said . An infect later in the fetus develop , when the brain is nearli fulli form , can do damag that is less obviou but still signific .It is pretti scari ,  said Dr. Ur Meyer , a behavior neurobiologist at the Swiss Feder Institut of Technolog in Zurich who studi the consequ of fetal infect in laboratori anim . These problem are on a continu scale , and whether you end up with autism or schizophrenia is complex  and we realli cant predict it.Evid ha increas for year that mental ill may be link to exposur dure pregnanc to virus like rubella , herp and influenza , and to parasit like Toxoplasma gondii .It can happen with a varieti of virus and other infecti agent , but we dont know how often ,  said Dr. E. Fuller Torrey , the execut director of the Stanley Medic Research Institut in Chevi Chase , Md .Dr. Torrey note that Rosemari Kennedi , sister of Presid of John F. Kennedi , wa born in 1918 dure the Spanish flu epidem . She had mental disabl as a child and develop schizophrenia-lik symptom at age 20 . Although some historian have attribut her disabl to a lack of oxygen at birth , Dr. Torrey believ that viral infect in utero is the most likely explan .The possibl that in utero infect could contribut to mental ill first emerg with an observ in 1988 by Finnish research that children born dure the 1957 Asian flu epidem had high rate of schizophrenia later in life .Research have long note that schizophrenia is highest in adult who were born in winter and earli spring  just after the peak of flu season .But estim of the size of the risk vari . One 2011 analysi of other studi estim that matern infect of ani kind account for 6 percent of all case of schizophrenia . ( Research have done veri larg studi in Finland , Sweden and Denmark becaus they have cradle-to-grav record on million of citizen . )By contrast , a 2001 studi of adult born to mother infect with rubella , or German measl , dure the last American epidem , which last from 1964 to 1965 , found that 20 percent had schizophrenia symptom . The expect rate among adult is below 1 percent .Dr. Alan S. Brown , the director of birth cohort studi at Columbia Univers Medic School and leader of that studi , said it wa certainli possible that Zika pose a similar risk , although ideal , youd want a control study.Although children may be troubl , the hallucin , voic and paranoia of true schizophrenia do not normal emerg until late adolesc , when there is a lot of rearrang and prune in the brain ,  said Dr. Robert H. Yolken , a development neurovirologist at John Hopkin Univers , who also believ that Zika increas mental ill risk .The effect of Zika mimic those of rubella , some expert note : Both caus onli a mild rash in adult , but can caus stillbirth , microcephali and eye malform in newborn .In the 1964-65 rubella epidem , about 20,000 newborn suffer consequ : A total of 11,000 were born deaf , 3,500 were born blind , and at least 1,800 were later found to have mental problem .That epidem infect an estim 12 million American . More than 500 million peopl live in the countri of Latin America and the Caribbean to which the World Health Organ ha predict that Zika will spread .Dr. Stanley A. Plotkin , a rubella expert , said it wa possibl that children who surviv matern Zika infect with no sign of microcephali could still display mental deficit as they grow .Ani viru in the blood of a pregnant woman is a risk to the fetu , so ultim there may be damag ,  he said . Hi own work as a pediatrician show that mani children who surviv the 1964-65 epidem suffer from autism , learn disabl and behavior disabilities.The Zika viru seem to zero in on nerv cell even more than doe rubella , which also caus heart defect , for exampl .Pathologist in Ljubljana , Slovenia , who dissect a microcephal fetu abort at 32 week by a European woman who had becom pregnant in Brazil report last week that they found sever fetal brain injuri associ with ZIKV infect with vertic transmission  mean the Zika viru had come from the mother infect .But a pathogen may not even have to reach the fetu to caus damag .Flu virus do not cross the placenta , Dr. Meyer of the Swiss Institut said , but the mother immun reaction creat a storm of cytokin , some of which do . Cytokin are small signaling protein that can caus cell to stop grow .How much damag is done depend not just on the viru and the mother immun respons , but at which stage of pregnanc the infect strike .First-trimest infect may caus brain tissu to calcifi and die ; later one may have subtler , but still insidi , effect .For exampl , Dr. Lipkin of the Columbia immun center said that hi lab in 2010 infect pregnant mice with a synthet RNA viru that replic in fetal mous brain . The result were wildli unpredict .If you infect them halfway through gestat , the offspr were withdrawn ; they sat in a corner of their cage and didnt interact at all ,  he said . If you did it two-third of the way through , they were hyperactive.Report suggest that Brazil , which wa face econom crise even befor the Zika outbreak , ha littl capac to cope with a surg of mental disabl children .European research initi paid littl attent to the South American outbreak , Dr. Meyer said . But that ha chang .The inform wer hear now is just overwhelm ,  he said . A whole gener of children might be affected.', 'In 1997 , scientist found the first scrap of Neanderth DNA in a fossil . Sinc then , they have recov genet materi , even entir genom , from a number of Neanderth bone , and their investig have yield a remark surpris : Today , 1 to 2 percent of the DNA in non-African peopl come from Neanderth .That genet legaci is the result of interbreed roughli 50,000 year ago between Neanderth and the common ancestor of European and Asian . Recent studi suggest that Neanderth gene even influenc human health today , contribut to condit from allergi to depress .Now scientist have found that the gene flow both way . In a studi publish on Wednesday in Natur , a team of scientist report that anoth instanc of interbreed left Neanderth in Siberia with chunk of human DNA .Thi exchang , the scientist conclud , took place about 100,000 year ago . That a puzzl date , becaus a great deal of evid indic that the ancestor of today non-African did not expand out of Africa until 50,000 to 60,000 year ago .It possibl , then , that these Neanderth acquir DNA from a mysteri earli migrat of human .I think at thi point wev convinc everybodi the observ is real ,  said Adam Siepel , a geneticist at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratori and a co-author of the new studi . But the stori behind the observ is still veri much in dispute.Human and Neanderth split from a common ancestor in Africa about 600,000 year ago . At some point afterward , the ancestor of Neanderth spread to Europ , the Middl East and Central Asia .Along the way , Neanderth took on a distinct anatomi  a stocki , power build  and becam impress hunter of big game . The last Neanderth appear to have die about 40,000 year ago .In 2010 , scientist at the Max Planck Institut for Evolutionari Anthropolog in Leipzig , Germani , recov about 60 percent of a Neanderth genom from fossil found in a Croatian cave . Neanderth share certain mutat with live European and Asian , the scientist found  but not with modern African . They conclud that human must have interbr with Neanderth after leav Africa .Three year later , the Max Planck team reconstruct the complet genom of a male Neanderth from a toe bone date back at least 50,000 year , which had been discov in the Altai Mountain of Siberia . Compar the Altai genom to modern human DNA confirm the interbreed .Recent , the research harvest more DNA from European Neanderth fossil , put togeth veri detail reconstruct of a singl chromosom , Chromosom 21 .Sergi Castellano , a geneticist at Max Planck Institut , set out to compar thi European Neanderth DNA to the gene from Siberia . He wa curiou about how isol the popul of Neanderth were from one anoth , and how they were relat to human aliv today .He wa join by Dr. Siepel , who ha develop power statist model in recent year to trace how DNA chang over time . He and hi colleagu are abl to compar genom and infer their common histori : how their ancestor split apart , for exampl , and how larg the popul of their ancestor were .Dr. Siepel , Dr. Castellano and their colleagu use these model to analyz the Neanderth DNA and that of human . Their analysi confirm previou studi : Some Neanderth DNA did inde end up in modern European and Asian .But they also found anoth exampl of so-cal gene flow , and an unexpect one at that : The Altai Neanderth in particular share some mutat with live African , but not with European and Asian .That pattern suggest that an African lineag of human interbr with the ancestor of the Altai Neanderth after they split from other Neanderth .Dr. Castellano and Dr. Siepel thought at first there wa someth wrong with their analysi , so they went back to fix it . But when they look for the problem , they could not find it .We poke and prod and poke and prod , and couldnt get it to go away ,  said Dr. Siepel .Onc the scientist accept that the interbreed wa real , they estim when it happen . When DNA get pass down through the gener , it get shuffl into new arrang that can be use to build a sort of timelin .Base on thi gene shuffl , the scientist estim that human and the ancestor of the Altai Neanderth interbr about 100,000 year ago  long befor peopl were thought to have left Africa . Thi observ throw a wrench in the work ,  said Dr. Siepel .Benc Viola , a paleontologist at the Univers of Toronto and a co-author of the new studi , said he wa skeptic when he first learn of the genet data . It realli weird , that my main impress ,  he said .Eventu , howev , Dr. Castellano persuad him the data were strong , and Dr. Viola look over the fossil record for possibl explan for the interbreed .In the 1930 , for exampl , scientist discov 120,000-year-old fossil in Israel that look a lot like live human . Mani scientist view them as a fail human migrat from Africa , with no genet connect to human today .In Octob , Chines research discov anoth intrigu clue in a cave : 47 teeth that they estim are between 80,000 and 120,000 year old . The scientist argu that the teeth belong to modern human .Dr. Viola is not complet convinc by the Chines studi . Instead , he think the scenario that best fit the evid is that human expand into the Middl East encount and interbr with Neanderth there . The Neanderth then migrat east to Siberia , take human DNA with them .It seem pretti solid ,  said Jonathan K. Pritchard , a geneticist at Stanford Univers who wa not involv in the studi . Overal , the stori theyr tell is pretti coherent.Dr. Pritchard said that more examin of ancient DNA would help resolv the mani question rais by the new studi and help scientist understand the scope of the intim back-and-forth between Neanderth and human .There go to be a lot more data realli soon ,  he said . I would expect in the next few year well have much , much more of the jigsaw puzzl , and it will be possibl to piec thi all together.', 'Thi unattach ear bath in pink goo may look like a freaki find from Frankenstein laboratori , but it actual the product of a decad worth of medic research with 3-D print .Bioengin from the Wake Forest Institut for Regen Medicin in North Carolina craft the ear along with a jawbon , skull bone and skelet muscl use what they call an integr tissu and organ print system. They then implant them into mice and rat and found that the 3-D print biolog structur not onli stay aliv for sever month , but grew .The team member publish the blueprint behind their construct thi week in the journal Natur Biotechnolog . In the past , medic research have creat similar chunk of tissu and organ prototyp use 3-D printer load with live cell , but mani of those print were either structur unfit for transplant or unabl to surviv within a host .Scientist have place human-s ear structur into rodent befor , but those ear were not 3-D print , or did not keep their structur for long or did not grow cartilag and blood vessel as thi one did .Though we are still a way from implant 3-D print heart and kidney into mice or rat , these are step toward creat replac organ that can be transplant into peopl . More than 120,000 American are current wait for lifesav transplant accord to the U.S. Depart of Health & Human Servic , and the research said their print techniqu could one day produc clinic use tissu and organ .The new machin work similarli to tradit 3-D printer in that it squirt out layer upon layer of materi to form it product . But rather than use plastic , thi printer use a mix of human , mice , rat or rabbit cell and gelatin as it ink . The machin combin it primari build materi , call hydrogel , with a biodegrad plastic to produc a stabl structur strong enough to keep it shape upon transplant . Both materi allow oxygen and blood to flow through the print tissu , keep it aliv within it host .In thi experi the research insert the ear beneath the skin of a mouse back and found that sever month later the rodent creat blood vessel that attach to the print ear and enabl it to thrive . The research also insert muscl tissu print from their machin into a rat , which later develop both blood vessel and nerv to the implant .The team hope that similar outcom will occur if they implant their 3-D print biostructur into peopl , and they plan to conduct human trial next .', 'The brightest orb in the center of thi photograph captur by the Hubbl Space Telescop is a galaxi some 300 million light-year away call NGC 4889 .At it core rest a supermass black hole that is about 21 billion time the size of the sun , accord to NASA and the European Space Agenc .Though you can not see it in thi imag becaus black hole swallow light , NASA said it wa one of the largest star devour ever observ .

But the sea butterfli , a marin snail the size of a peppercorn , ha long appear to use winglik appendag to fli through the water .After a detail studi of the snail , research at Georgia Tech report Wednesday in The Journal of Experiment Biolog that the sea butterfli flap it wing the same way a fruit fli doe , in a figur eight pattern that provid lift in the water in the way the wing of tini insect do in air .They saw for the first time vortex around the tip of the wing that insect research had not been abl to detect , accord to David W. Murphi , the first author on the paper . Dr. Murphi , now a research at John Hopkin , said the sea butterfly motion wa easier to see becaus insect flap their wing hundr of time a second , while the sea butterfli ha four to five wing beat a second .Dr. Murphi built the apparatu use to studi the sea butterfli for hi doctor thesi . The snail wa one of mani creatur use to test it , all littl one- to five-millimet zooplankton ,  he said .The experiment setup includ four high-spe camera and two infrar laser train on a tank of seawat to illumin a cubic volum less than an inch on a side . Dr. Murphi seed the water in the tank with light reflect particl less than three thousandth of an inch in diamet . It wa the swirl pattern of those particl dure the sea butterfly wateri flight that show how the wing gener lift .Dr. Murphi said that to produc the figur eight wing path so similar to those trace by insect wing , the snail rotat it bodi in a way the research hadnt seen befor . They call it hyperpitch .Otherwis , the snail use a motion call clap and fling , just like a fruit fli . It may seem surpris that the motion would work in air and in water , but both are fluid and obey similar physic law . Water is more viscou , but the snail is larger than a tini insect like a fruit fli . In technic term , one in the air and the other in water have the same Reynold number , a ratio of momentum to viscos .The hyperpitch might be someth for design of fli microrobot to consid . Apart from practic valu , the studi , like other in the field of fluid dynam , produc stun imag . And it confirm that the tini snail name wa entir fit .The sea butterfli is basic an honorari insect ,  Dr. Murphi said .', 'More peopl than ever are hope they have The Right Stuff ,  and more peopl than ever will be disappoint that they do not .By the deadlin on Thursday , more than 18,300 peopl had submit their rsum in hope of join the next group of NASA astronaut .

That is until earlier thi month when a team of pathologist report find two case of cancer in mole rat hous in zoo .Doe thi cancel out the possibl that nake mole rat may hold a clue to fight cancer ? Not at all , said Martha Delaney , a veterinari pathologist at the Univers of Washington School of Medicin and lead author on the studi , which wa publish in the journal Veterinari Patholog earlier thi month . Rather , she said , these particular case , one of glandular cancer and anoth of stomach cancer , may provid addit clue as to what make mole rat so much less suscept to cancer than other rodent and speci with long life span .Now that we have two nake mole rat with cancer ,  she said in an email , we can studi the coloni from which they came to elucid whi they are cancer prone , compar to other zoo and research colonies.Dr. Delaney and her colleagu have studi lesion on nake mole rat for more than a decad , but it wasnt until last fall when they came across their first cancer case . Veterinarian from the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago sent the team a dark red and purpl mass that wa remov from the armpit of a 22-year-old male nake mole rat .

He also is overse a new statewid task forc of truck compani and govern offici tri to reduc overal emiss from freight deliveri , includ for e-commerc .Dr. Sperl said that consum share as much respons for the environment cost of the deliveri as the compani that provid the speedi servic .From a sustain perspect , wer head in the wrong direct ,  he said .But measur the effect of the cardboard economi is more difficult .There are possibl trade-off , for exampl . As peopl shop more onlin , they might use their car less . And deliveri servic have immens incent to find the most effici rout , keep their fuel cost and emiss down . For it part , Amazon said that deliv to consum straight from huge warehous cut down the need to distribut to thousand of store .So far , though , shopper appear to be order onlin while still drive to brick-and-mortar store at least as much as in the past , accord to Dr. Sperl and other academ . One recent studi explor the environment effect of Internet shop in Newark , Del. , and found that a rise in e-commerc in recent year by local resid correspond to more truck on the road and an increas in greenhous emiss .Ardeshi Faghri , a professor of civil engin at the Univers of Delawar , said the increas of variou emiss  which he estim at 20 percent from 2001 to 2011  could be due to a multitud of reason , but we think that onlin shop and more deliveri truck are realli one of the primari reasons.Onlin shop ha not help the environ ,  he said . It ha made it worse.Other scholar say that , at least for now , onlin shop appear to be complement brick-and-mortar shop , not replac it .Peopl who shop onlin also like to see and feel thing ,  said Cara Wang , an associ professor at Renssela Polytechn Institut who studi transport issu and ha written a paper about habit of onlin shopper . And they have to return things.Dr. Wang and other research say the demand for instant deliveri , in particular , creat challeng for truck compani tri to be effici .

It also work with manufactur to send some product without addit cardboard packag , said Craig Berman , a compani spokesman .Though recycl can make consum think they are help the environ , the process ha it own cost , includ the emiss from ship it to recycl center , which use a lot of energi and water . Don Fullerton , a professor of financ and an expert in econom and the environ at the Univers of Illinoi , said one possibl solut would be to make the retail respons for take back the box .

A chemist at the Hong Kong Univers of Scienc and Technolog , he wa look at a powder that glow bright green under ultraviolet light . But when the powder wa dissolv in a clear solut , the glow disappear .It wa 2001 , and Dr. Tang observ defi everyth then known about light-emit molecul .I wa veri excit ,  he said in an interview , but in anoth way , I wa bother , becaus I didnt know what wa go on.What he had , he later determin , were molecul that lit up onli when crowd togeth  in solid form , for exampl . Dr. Tang studi of that chemic and it unusu behavior ha led to an emerg class of small , nonmet compound with applic in unusu divers arena , from vastli improv optoelectron devic like organ light-emit diod ( OLE ) televis to advanc the use of fluoresc technolog in the human bodi .For exampl , they could provid surgeon with better way to visual tumor , or enabl noninvas destruct of tumor ,  said Richard Conroy , the director of the divis of appli scienc and technolog at the Nation Institut of Biomed Imag and Bioengin .For year , scientist tri to develop fluoresc molecul grappl with a tricki problem : The molecules light went out when they were too crowd . Becaus fluoresc molecul are almost alway use as a group , the problem of quench , as thi phenomenon is known , prevent mani otherwis promis compound from reach real-world applic .In the past , we hope the fluoresc dye will go to the tumor site so that well see the tumor , but we also hope that not too mani go so that it will not quench ,  Dr. Tang said . You see the dilemma there.For OLE technolog like slim , energi effici , high-contrast TV , we should want organ compound that emit light in the solid state ,  said Masaki Shimizu , a professor at Kyoto Institut of Technolog in Japan , who design light-emit materi for optoelectron devic .That ha been hard to achiev .Fluoresc occur when materi absorb energi and then emit it as light . Convent fluoresc molecul are flat , and they stack on top of one anoth like pancak when they are too close , kill the light . In contrast , the molecul that Dr. Tang wa studi wa propeller-shap , with five flat blades connect to a central ring . It like an electr fan ,  he said .With that molecul , a differ mechan wa at work . Togeth with a postdoctor fellow , Junwu Chen , Dr. Tang reason that when the molecul were free to move around , they wast their energi by rotat their blade , produc heat rather than light . But onc space wa restrict , they theoriz , the molecul would be unabl to move , and thu forc to releas their energi as light . They name thi phenomenon aggregation-induc emission.To prove thi , Dr. Chen perform a seri of experi . First , he froze a solut of the molecul in liquid nitrogen so they could not move . Next , he ad glycerol , a thick liquid , to slow the molecul . Dr. Chen left the lab in 2002 , but Dr. Tang student continu investig . They appli pressur on the solid powder , squeez the molecul further . They chemic chang the molecul by ad bridg to lock the blade in place . In all the experi , the molecul shone brighter .Establish thi mechan took two year . Then Dr. Tang group began to look for other molecul with similar shape that would also undergo aggregation-induc emiss  AIE for short . The first AIE molecul , which Dr. Tang name AIE-gen after mesogen , or liquid crystal , contain silicon and wa difficult to prepar . For the next AIE-gen , Dr. Tang want someth easi to make that wa carbon-bas . He tri tetraphenylethylen ( TPE ) , a hydrocarbon molecul shape like a dog bone with two big blade at each end .Under ultraviolet light , TPE produc a disappointingli weak sky-blu glow . What TPE lack in brillianc , it made up for in versatil . Dr. Tang and hi team soon realiz that they could easili make TPE brighter or chang the light color by tweak it structur or place it in differ environ . Thi is a star molecul ,  Dr. Tang said .The next major advanc came when Dr. Tang realiz that AIE-gen could be attach to other materi like metal-detect compound , protein or DNA fragment , and still keep their light-emit properti .That veri power ,  said Tim Cook , an assist chemistri professor at the Univers at Buffalo . Independ of Dr. Tang research , Dr. Cook ha prepar self-assembl , light-emit materi by attach AIE-gen to compound alreadi known to self-assembl . You can basic adapt it to ani system ,  he said .Live system are of particular interest . AIE-gen do not contain metal , unlik compet fluoresc materi like quantum dot . Thi make them one of the most promis candid for use in human , to guid surgeon or deliv light therapi . That probabl one of the most excit area of research for us ,  Dr. Conroy said .In 2011 , Bin Liu , a chemic engin professor at the Nation Univers of Singapor , pack a few differ AIE-gen from Dr. Tang into capsul , creat a seri of veri bright and robust nanoparticl . In experi to track cancer cell migrat in mice , the nanoparticl were at least 10 time as bright and last three time as long as quantum dot develop for the job . Last year , Dr. Liu spinoff compani , LuminiCel , began produc and sell the AIE-gen nanoparticl .Besid AIE-gen for biolog applic , there are AIE-gen that can detect heavi metal , cyanid , explos or harm bacteria . Other can help improv OLE display by elimin the quench problem , make OLE much easier to manufactur .But commerci of AIE materi may not be so easi . There are a great mani fluoresc technolog ,  Chri Gedd , the director of the Institut of Fluoresc at the Univers of Maryland , said . Whether the AIE technolog will make it , onli time will tell.Still , 15 year in , Dr. Tang and other say that the known AIE-gen may be just the begin . Now , research are report that other materi like cluster of gold atom , not just small organ molecul , can undergo AIE as well .Thi open up huge opportun ,  Dr. Tang said . I am veri optimistic.', 'TO THE EDITOR :Re Open Up About Depression ( Feb. 9 ) : Kudo for Steven Petrow articl .

Calcul exactli how mani microb each of us carri is hard , and the most common number cite , both in popular and scientif literatur , is almost certainli wrong .In 1972 , Thoma D. Luckey publish an articl in The American Journal of Clinic Nutrit in which he wrote that an adult male had 100 x 1012 , or 100 trillion , microb in hi gut , and anoth one trillion on hi skin . He gave no refer for either figur .Anoth scientist , D. C. Savag , cite Dr. Luckey in a review publish in 1977 , write that the normal human organ can be said to be compos of over 1014 cell , of which onli about 10 percent are anim cells. So , he use Dr. Luckey number , 100 trillion , for bacteria , and ad that one-10th of those  10 trillion  were human cell .Thi neat ratio caught on , and the phrase 10 time as mani microbi cell as human cells is often repeat , as it is on the websit of the Human Microbiom Project of the Nation Institut of Health , where presum they know someth about the microbiom .A recent estim put the number of human cell at 37.2 trillion , but Dr. Savage ratio ha surviv . Use the 10-to-1 formula , the number of bacteria would be about 372 trillion , and there it ha stood .But now a group of Isra scientist ha conclud that 372 trillion can not be right . Their new analysi wa publish in the Jan. 28 issu of the journal Cell , with more detail and calcul avail onlin .Use one cubic micromet as the volum of a singl bacterium , they made their estim base on the volum of the organ that contain microb , along with the like concentr of bacteria in each place . The research estim that the larg intestin , where most of our microbiom live , contain 39 trillion bacteri cell . Other place  the skin , the mouth , the small intestin and stomach  contain veri few bacteria , and togeth add onli a small amount to the total .Whi is thi knowledg use ? Sometim you cant show whi on the spot ,  said one of the author , Dr. Shai Fuch . But get in the habit of use the best number avail is import . If you can make a better estim today than 10 year ago , it a worthwhil effort.Dr. Fuch , along with hi co-author , Ron Milo and Ron Sender , wrote the analysi when he wa a doctor student at the Weizmann Institut of Scienc in Israel .Of cours , thi is still onli an estim , base on a 155-pound man 20 to 30 year old and 5 feet 7 inch tall . The size of the microbiom vari by age , sex , height and weight , and even chang moment to moment : One bowel movement liber about a third of the bacteria in the colon .But , the research conclud , a realist estim of the number of microb live in the human bodi is about 40 trillion  close to the number of our human cell .', 'Mosquito may be receiv all the attent amid the Zika viru epidem , but they are hardli the onli diseas vector to worri about .

The patient had symptom similar to , but not precis the same as , those caus by Borrelia burgdorferi , until now the onli speci known to caus Lyme diseas in North America .Lyme diseas wa diagnos in the patient with avail test . But avail diagnost screen may be miss other infect with the newli discov bacteria , the scientist acknowledg .Dr. Bobbi Pritt , the medic director of the microbiolog laboratori at the Mayo Clinic , where the new strain wa first detect , recommend that patient with exposur to tick in Minnesota and Wisconsin receiv antibodi and polymeras chain reaction test to detect B. mayonii if they are concern about Lyme infect but do not have the telltal bulls-ey rash .Becaus the symptom vari slightli from those normal seen in B. burgdorferi infect , doctor may not even think to test for Lyme diseas , she said .Onli one of the six patient had the bulls-ey rash that is Lyme signatur , present in 70 percent to 80 percent of report case . Three patient had a rash that wa more spread out , Dr. Pritt said .The new strain appar add nausea and vomit to the list of typic Lyme symptom , which includ fever , headach and neck pain . B. mayonii patient also had a higher-than-expect concentr of bacteria in their blood .Fortun , the antibiot treatment normal use to treat Lyme diseas appear to be effect against B. mayonii , Dr. Pritt said .In the summer of 2013 , a technician in Dr. Pritt lab notic some unusu result from a genet screen of a patient bacteri infect . The test suggest Lyme diseas , but a closer analysi found a new speci of bacteria caus the condit .It is not yet clear where B. mayonii came from , Dr. Pritt said , though it doe not seem to have recent diverg from B. burgdorferi . It may be that the speci ha alway been present , but wa pick up onli with better detect tool , or that the new bacteria are increas for some reason .We hope to be abl to answer that with more studi ,  Dr. Pritt said .In Europ , Lyme diseas is caus by multipl pathogen speci of Borrelia , said Per-Er Lindgren , a professor of medic microbiolog at Linkop Univers in Sweden .While scientist were alreadi awar that there were sever possibl caus of Lyme diseas , the discoveri of the first Borrelia speci in more than a decad is realli excit and interest ,  said Dr. Lindgren , who wrote a commentari accompani the report in The Lancet Infecti Diseas .Although the six patient at the Mayo Clinic receiv the diagnos with typic test , he said , normal your onli abl to detect what you are look for. Other case are probabl be miss , Dr. Lindgren ad : It veri like you could make the diagnost tool better.Field studi in Minnesota have shown that one-third to one-half of adult tick , and one in five young tick , call nymph , carri B. burgdorferi , the previous known bacteria . Onli 1 percent to 4 percent carri B. mayonii , said Dave Neitzel , the supervisor of the vector-born diseas unit at the Minnesota Depart of Health .Thi is just anoth great reason to protect yourself against tick ,  he said .To protect against tick-born ill , peopl should wear repel and check their skin for black speck after spend time outdoor , particularli in wood area and dure the late spring and earli summer month when nymph are present .The nymph are smaller than the adult and easier to miss on the skin , Mr. Neitzel said .If a tick is remov within the first 24 to 48 hour , it is unlik to caus diseas . The sooner you get that tick off of your bodi , the better ,  he said . You dont have to get too mani tick on you befor you find one that infect with something.Dr. Pritt said she wa now far more cautiou outdoor .If youv ever look at an idyl pictur of a beauti meadow with flower  I look at it and think about all the tick in there ,  she said .', 'The human brain is attract to thing that were onc pleas even if they no longer are , research report .

They hint at the promis of outfox learn deficit with cognit scienc , expert said , but they also point to the difficulti involv .The learn techniqu develop by cognit psychologist seem , in some respect , an easi fit for peopl with attent deficit : break up studi time into chunk , mix relat materi in a session , vari studi environ . Each can produc improv in retent or comprehens , and taken togeth captur the more scatter spirit of those with attent deficit hyperact disord , especi children .The test effect ha prove especi reliabl for other student , and it is a natur first choic to measur the potenti applic to A.D.H.D . The principl is straightforward : Onc a student is familiar with a topic , test himself on it deepen the recal of the materi more effici than restudi .In one new studi , led by Laura Knous of the Univers of Richmond , 100 colleg student , 25 with A.D.H.D. , tri to memor two set of 48 word . The student studi the word list in two session , watch as the word appear for a few second on a comput screen . In follow-up session , they restudi one list and took a free-recal test on the other list . After two day , they came back to the lab and took an exam on all the word . They were given 20 minut to rememb as mani as they could .We found that you do better when you test yourself , rather than restudi , and that it didnt matter if you had A.D.H.D . or not ,  Dr. Knous said in an interview . On averag , the student recal about 35 percent of the word they had studi twice , and 45 percent of those they studi onc and then quizz themselv on .The other studi found someth altogeth differ . Psychologist at Triniti Colleg in Hartford had 36 student , half with an A.D.H.D . diagnosi , studi two short scienc essay , one on sea otter and the other on the sun . The experi proceed like the Richmond one : The student then restudi one of the essay in a separ session , and test themselv on the other essay  free recal  type as much as they rememb read .Again , they return to the lab two day later for a comprehens exam on both essay . Thi time , there wa no differ in perform for those with A.D.H.D. , and onli minuscul improv , on the pretested essay , for those without the diagnosi .If anyth , for the A.D.H.D . group , the restudi wa a littl bit better ,  said Nicol Dudukov , the lead author , who is now at the Univers of Oregon . The like reason , she said , wa that the student with attent deficit did not rememb much from the first studi session , so the pretest wa a wash .We also suspect that there will be some individu differ in how well thi techniqu work , from person to person ,  Dr. Dudukov ad .And there the rub , expert said . A.D.H.D. , like mani mental condit , manifest as a spectrum of discret type , some more hyperact , other more distract . Then there are the effect of the stimul medic that mani with A.D.H.D . take , which neither studi address .Clearli , there a lot of work to be done ,  said Gregori Fabiano , a psychologist at the Univers at Buffalo .

How doe one dog instantli recogn anoth as a dog , not some other anim ?A . Studi of dogs abil to discrimin their kind from other anim show that they can do so base on pure visual evid , even in imag .Thi is even more remark in view of the fact that domest dog , Cani familiari , present the largest phenotyp divers among domest mammal ,  in the word of one studi , done in Franc and publish in 2013 in the journal Anim Cognit .Rang in size from a tini Maltes to a giant St. Bernard , and show myriad differ in coat , snout , ear , tail and bone structur , dog might not alway appear to belong to one speci .

I didnt think it wa time yet.In the ensu month , howev , two more physician recommend palli care , so the Chin agre to see the team at Mount Sinai Hospit .They have becom convert . It wa quit a relief ,  Mr. Chin said . Our doctor listen to everyth : the pain , the cathet , the vomit , the tired . You cant bring up issu like thi with an oncologist.Multipl prescript have made hi mother more comfort . A social worker help the famili grappl with home care schedul and insur . Mr. Chin , who frequent translat for hi Cantonese-speak mother , can call nurs with question at ani hour .Challeng remain  Mrs. Chin still isnt eat much  but her son now wish the famili had agre to palli care earlier .Perhap it not surpris that mani famili know littl about palli care ; it onli becam an approv medic specialti in 2007 . It ha grown rapidli in hospit : More than 70 percent now offer palli care servic , includ 90 percent of those with more than 300 bed .But most ail patient arent in hospit , and dont want to be . Outpati servic like Mount Sinai have been slower to take hold . A few hundr exist around the countri , estim Dr. Dian Meier , who direct the Center to Advanc Palli Care , which advoc better access to these servic .Dr. Meier said she expect that number to climb as the Afford Care Act and Medicar continu to shift health care payment away from the fee-for-servic model .Becaus most peopl with seriou ill are older , senior and caregiv should understand that palli care offer more care as need , not less . Unlik hospic , patient can use it at ani point in an ill  mani will graduate as they recov  without forgo cur treatment .Like hospic , howev , palli care focus on qualiti of life , provid emot and spiritu support for patient and famili , along with drug and other remedi to eas symptom . It practition help patient explor the complex medic decis they often face , then document their prefer .It pay off for patient and famili . In 2010 , a random trial of 151 patient with metastat lung cancer at Massachusett Gener Hospit found that those who receiv earli palli care score significantli higher on qualiti of life measur than those receiv standard care , and were less like to suffer from depress .They were also less like to get aggress end-of-lif treatment like chemotherapi in their final week . Yet they surviv sever month longer .Other studi have found similar benefit . Compar with control group , palli care patient get greater relief from the breathless associ with lung diseas ; theyr less like to spend time in intens care unit ; they report greater satisfact with care and higher spiritu well-b .And they do better if they seek palli care earli . A new studi conduct at the cancer center at the Univers of California , San Francisco , found that of 922 patient who had die , most in their 60 and 70 , those who had receiv palli care for 90 day or more were less like to have late-lif hospit and to visit intens care unit or emerg room than those who sought care later .The reduc hospit use also save thousand of dollar per patient , a bonu other studi have document .If peopl arent in excruci pain at 3 a.m. , they dont call 911 and go to the emerg room ,  Dr. Meier point out .Yet palli care remain underus . Even at the well-establish U.C.S.F . cancer center , which began offer the servic in 2005 , onli a third of patient in the studi had receiv a palli care referr .We hear thi all the time : Theyr not readi for palli care ,  as if it a stage peopl have to accept , as oppos to someth that should be a routin part of care ,  said Dr. Eric Widera , who practic the specialti at the univers .In fact , the cancer center at U.C.S.F . adopt a euphemist name for it palli team : the symptom manag service.We deliber call it that becaus of how much ignor or confus or even bia there wa against the term palli care ,  said Dr. Michael Rabow , director of the servic and senior author of the new studi .Although 40 percent of their palli care patient can expect to be cure , there clearli still are both patient and oncologist who have an inappropri associ in their mind ,  he said . They still associ palli care with give up.To the contrari , palli care can help patient live fulli , regardless of their prognos . Consid Herman Storey , a 71-year-old San Franciscan , an Air Forc veteran , a retir retail buyer and manag , a patient who feel quit well despit a diagnosi of inoper liver cancer .Hi oncologist at the San Francisco V.A . Medic Center  the Depart of Veteran Affair ha been a leader in thi specialti  refer him to the palli care servic last fall when Mr. Storey said he didnt intend to pursu chemotherapi .They want me to reconsid ,  Mr. Storey said , but I dont want to get sick and tire of be sick and tired. Chemotherapi for a previou bout of cancer had help him surviv for three year ; it had also made him veri ill .Dr. Barbara Drye , medic director of outpati palli care at the cancer center , walk Mr. Storey through hi option . The suggest chemo might extend hi life by sever month , she explain . It would also take a toll .It can caus not onli nausea and diarrhea , but it affect your tast ,  she said . Food tast like cardboard . Fatigu can markedli decreas the amount of activ someon can do.Thi time , Mr. Storey decid against treatment . A skill cook , proud of the duck confit dinner he serv guest at Christma , he want to continu to enjoy cook and dine out with friend .Besid , he ha plan : In May , he expect to visit Pari for the 11th time , to mark hi 72nd birthday .Dr. Drye , who help Mr. Storey complet hi advanc direct , will arrang for home or inpati hospic care when he need it . Until then , she see him monthli .She ha gentli suggest that he take hi trip a bit earlier ; he ha declin .

How els to explain bite mark on the bone of ancient hominin , the appar gnaw of leopard or other African felin ?Big cat still pose a threat to primat . In one studi of chimpanze in Ivori Coast , for exampl , scientist estim that each chimp ran a 30 percent risk of be attack by a leopard everi year .A new studi suggest that the big cat may be get some tini help on the hunt . A parasit infect the brain of some primat , includ perhap our forebear , may make them less wari .What doe the parasit get out of it ? A ride into it felin host .The parasit is Toxoplasma gondii , a remark success single-cel organ . An estim 11 percent of American have dormant Toxoplasma cyst in their brain ; in some countri , the rate is as high as 90 percent . Infect with the parasit pose a seriou threat to fetus and to peopl with compromis immun system . But the vast major of those infect appear to show no seriou symptom . Their healthi immun system keep the parasit in check .Mammal and bird can also be infect . But cat in particular play a crucial part in the life cycl of the parasit : When a cat eat an infect anim , Toxoplasma gondii end up in it gut . It reproduc there , gener offspr call oocyst that are shed in the cat fece . The oocyst can last for month in the environ , where they can be taken up by new host .In the 1990 , scientist discov that mice and rat infect with Toxoplasma gondii lose their natur fear of cat odor  and in some case even appear to becom attract to them . It wa possibl , research specul , that the parasit had evolv an abil to influenc the behavior of it rodent host , to rais the chanc they might be eaten by cat .Subsequ studi have shown that the parasit can chang the wire of fear-rel region of the rat brain . Robert M. Sapolski , a biologist at Stanford Univers , said that these find led mani research to see Toxoplasma gondii as a parasit exquisit adapt to rodent . Accord to thi view , he said , Toxo be abl to infect a zillion nonrod speci is just some sort of irrelev evolutionari dead end.Even so , Toxoplasma gondii can caus intrigu chang in our brain as well . In a 2015 studi , for exampl , research found that women infect with the parasit are more aggress than those without it ; infect men behav more impuls than parasite-fre men .Clmenc Poirott , an evolutionari biologist at the Center for Function and Evolutionari Ecolog in Montpelli , Franc , wonder if our understand of Toxoplasma might be limit by the paltri number of speci in which it manipul had been studi . She and her colleagu decid to focu on chimpanze , run an experi on 33 ape at a primat research center in Gabon , nine of which had Toxoplasma infect .Instead of test the reaction of chimpanze to the odor of hous cat , Ms. Poirott and her colleagu turn to leopard , their natur predat . A veterinarian at a Gabon zoo suppli them with leopard urin , and they pour drop of it on the fenc enclos the space in which the chimpanze live .Step back from the fenc , the scientist observ the ape to see how they respond . They also ran the same experi with urin from three speci that are not chimpanzees natur predat : human , lion and tiger .Sometim , the chimpanze would approach the fenc and investig the smell ; other time , they would ignor it . Ms. Poirott and her colleagu found that chimpanze not infect with Toxoplasma investig the smell of leopard urin less than the smell of human .That the sort of behavior you would expect if the smell of leopard urin alarm the chimpanze  a healthi instinct that could keep them out of leopard territori and reduc their chanc of get kill .The Toxoplasma-infect chimpanze , on the other hand , check out the leopard urin more often than that of human , not less . They appear to have develop the same reckless observ in Toxoplasma-infect rodent .It so interest to see that Toxo seem to have evolv the same manipul abil in an ape with respect to it natur felin predat ,  said Dr. Sapolski , who wa not involv in the new studi .Other expert were also intrigu by the report . But Michael B. Eisen , a biologist at the Univers of California , Berkeley , said he didnt think it wa power enough to rule out other explan for how the chimpanze behav .There might be innat differ in how the chimpanze respond to odor , for exampl , that have noth to do with be infect with Toxoplasma . Id have to file thi , at best , in the interest but nowher near convincing file ,  Dr. Eisen said .Ms. Poirott acknowledg that it might be possibl to teas apart these differ possibl by test the chimpanze befor and after be infect with Toxoplasma . That would be a veri challeng experi to set up , howev .But the current studi provid anoth piec of evid that the parasit realli wa manipul the chimpanze . It work onli with leopard urin , and not with other felin which arent their natur predat ,  Ms. Poirott said .That the kind of precis youd expect from a parasit that ha evolv a strategi for get into one particular anim . It so specif that it suggest it Toxoplasma caus the behavior modif ,  Ms. Poirott said .She ad that it would be use now to studi Toxoplasma effect on other primat speci . It may even turn out that our primat ancestor were onc the primari target of the parasit .When domest cat emerg sever thousand year ago , the parasit might have expand into a new host popul that favor rodent rather than primat .It certainli suggest that Toxo behavior effect in human may be less of an irrelev dead end than wa alway assum ,  Dr. Sapolski said .', 'Stick insect , which look like walk twig , are popular as pet and research subject becaus theyr easi to keep , cant fli away , and move at a pace that allow observ and studi .I think theyr realli , realli sweet insect ,  said Chri J.

Combin the visual record with data from the forc plate , he and hi colleagu found that one hip joint ( the insect have two on each leg ) wa most import both in hold up the bodi and in exert the power to move it forward . He , Volker Drr and Josef Schmitz , also at the univers , report their find in the journal Proceed of the Royal Societi B .Dr. Dallmann , who studi how the nervou system control movement , start research on the stick insect becaus it reli on sensori feedback from it leg to navig and it walk slowli enough to offer a good chanc to studi how neural activ is translat into movement .For that , he said , research need go beyond the nervou system . They need to studi not onli the pattern of electr signal in the nervou system and the action of muscl , but also the forc act on those joint . They need to learn how everyth fit togeth ,  he said .The research found , unsurprisingli , that the hind leg push the insect forward and that the middl pair of leg mostli brake and steer .The front leg act more as sensor , feel the way as the insect move . In term of walk , Dr. Dallmann said , the insect act like a four-leg anim . What he and hi colleagu found surpris wa that the middl and hind leg bore the insect weight on the same joint that wa involv in propuls . One joint is the power joint ,  he said , keep the bodi abov ground and go forward.Hi research is part of a bigger project to develop a biomed robot . He hope to build someth like the stick insect in robot form to use for further studi .The research work with femal of the speci Carausiu morosu , the Indian or common stick insect . That wa no accid . Stick insect reproduc by a process call parthenogenesi  without male .They eat veget and feed mainli at night . In case of troubl , or when they are disturb , they play dead .

The 911 caller had report a man with a samurai sword , lung at peopl on the waterfront .It wa even , and when the polic arriv , they saw the man pace the beach and call to him . He respond by throw a rock at the embank where they stood .They shout to him from a sheriff boat ; he threw anoth rock . They told him to drop the sword ; he said he would kill them . He start to leav the beach , and after warn him , they shot him in the leg with a beanbag gun . He turn back , still carri the four-foot blade .In anoth citi  or in Portland itself not that long ago  the next step would almost certainli have been a direct confront and , had the man not put down the weapon , the use of lethal forc .But the Portland Polic Bureau , prod in part by the 2012 find of a Justic Depart investig , ha spent year put in place an intens train program and protocol for how offic deal with peopl with mental ill .At a time when polic behavior is under intens scrutini  a seri of fatal shoot by polic offic have focus nation attent on issu of race and mental ill  Portland approach ha serv as a model for other law enforc agenc around the countri .And on that Sunday last summer , the polic here chose a differ cours .At 2:30 a.m. , after spend hour tri to engag the man , the offic decid to disengag ,  and they withdrew , leav the man on the beach . A search at daylight found no sign of him .Peopl with mental ill are overrepres among civilian involv in polic shoot : Twenty-f percent or more of peopl fatal shot by the polic have had a mental disord , accord to variou analys .In Chicago , for exampl , polic offic kill a 19-year-old mental ill man , Quintonio LeGrier , in Decemb after the polic said he had come at them with a basebal bat . In Denver , Paul Castaway , 35 , who had a histori of mental ill , wa fatal shot by the polic last year after they said he move danger close to them , hold a knife to hi own throat . Similar encount have occur in Albuquerqu , Dalla , Indianapoli and other citi .In respons to public outcri , mani polic depart have , like Portland , turn to more train for their offic , in mani case adopt some version of a model pioneer in Memphi almost three decad ago and known as crisi intervent team train , or C.I.T .Studi have found that the train can alter the way offic view peopl with mental ill . And the approach , which teach offic way to defus potenti violent encount befor forc becom necessari , is use for offic face ani volatil situat , even if a mental health crisi is not involv , law enforc expert say .Whether the train lead to less use of forc by offic , howev , is still an open question : The find of studi have been mix , although one studi to be publish later thi year suggest that Portland program , which is base on C.I.T. , is have an effect . And train alon is not enough , expert say . For the approach to be effect , it need the full back of a polic department leadership , continu check on it effect , and collabor with the mental health commun .The train is great , but it not magic ,  said Laura Usher , coordin of crisi intervent team train for the Nation Allianc on Mental Ill . The thing that actual transform the way the system work is when everyon get together.The decis by the Portland polic to leav the sword-wield man on the beach wa controversi within the depart . Some offic argu that more should have been done : What if the man had injur or kill someon ?Other counter that it wa late and that the seclud area wa desert . The man had commit no crime . And a confront could easili have end with him or the offic be harm .But the discuss itself , some offic said , wa a sign of chang .Ten year ago , we would have been more proactiv in deal with him at the start ,  said Offic Brad Yakot , a specialist in mental health issu who wa call to the scene . It a new way of look at it.As in other citi , chang in Portland began with a fatal encount : On Sept. 17 , 2006 , Jame Chass Jr. , 42 , a singer in a local band who had schizophrenia , die after a confront with polic offic .Mr. Chasse death outrag the public . The Polic Bureau , in respons , revis polici and requir all it offic to complet 40 hour of crisi intervent train .But after more troubl instanc involv the mental ill , a Justic Depart investig conclud in 2012 that the Polic Bureau had shown a pattern or practic of unnecessari or unreason forc dure interact with peopl who have or are perceiv to have mental illness.Thi time , the Polic Bureau leadership respond far more aggress . In addit to the mandatori train for the entir forc , a group of about 100 patrol offic sign up for 40 extra hour of instruct to handl more complex call involv mental ill or drug and alcohol addict .Team of offic were pair with mental health clinician to follow up on case . New protocol were put in place . And the polic connect with hous and mental health organ to help further .It realli about a cultur shift ,  said Lt. Tashia Hager , who head the unit that coordin the department mental health respons .She note that in case like that of the man with the sword , there a potenti neg outcom regardless of the decis we make.In the past , she said , offic were taught , If you do thi , Im go to do that. Now they are encourag to question whether that is realli necessari .Offic need to be educ about mental ill , mani crimin justic expert say , becaus cutback in financ for mental health servic have put them on the front line of deal with mani peopl who have psychiatr disord .Jail around the countri have fill with mental ill inmat who , unabl to obtain treatment in the commun , are arrest time and again for minor offens like disorderli conduct and petti theft . Polic offic have been forc to play dual role as law enforc and psychiatr social worker .We are work in the backdrop of a fractur mental health system that ha gotten wors and wors ,  said Portland polic chief , Lawrenc ODea III .Yet mani polic offic know littl about mental disord , and what they do know is often shape by stigma . Bizarr behavior is often interpret as a prelud to violenc . And routin polic action aim at control  place a hand on a person shoulder , for exampl  can backfir with someon with a sever mental ill .Instead of be calm , it can trigger them to either pull away or resist ,  said Matthew Epperson , an assist professor of social work at the Univers of Chicago . The offic , in turn , can misinterpret such respons as resist or an attempt to flee , he ad .In the crisi train , offic learn about psychiatr medic , role-play variou scenario , and have opportun to interact with peopl who have a mental ill when they are not in crisi .The offic are told , among other thing , to use distanc and time to tri to defus potenti violent encount .About 2,700 law enforc agenc around the countri use some form of the approach , said Ms . Usher , of the mental ill allianc , and that number is grow as more depart have come under pressur to chang polic behavior .In Januari , respond to a seri of high-profil shoot across the countri , a group of law-enforc leader urg depart to adopt higher standard for the use of forc than those set down by the Suprem Court , and to adopt method to defus volatil situat and avoid violenc .Some depart requir crisi train for all their offic . But Maj. Sam Cochran , who coordin the first crisi intervent program in Memphi and now consult with other depart , said he believ the train work best when depart train a smaller group of volunt who then took the lead on polic call involv mental health issu .There all kind of special in law enforc ,  Major Cochran said . Wev got bomb technician , narcot , robberi . I want all the offic present at a scene to understand that thi C.I.T. offic is the leader . That repres clariti , and respons bring about a level of accountability.In a draft report releas thi month , outsid monitor conclud that the Polic Bureau in Portland still had more to do , includ keep better track of how mani polic contact involv mental health issu .But the bureau , the monitor said , had made substanti progress in improv the way they dealt with the mental ill .And the studi of the Portland polic that is to be publish later thi year found that the use of forc by offic had decreas by 65.4 percent from 2008 to 2014 , as measur in quarterli report . The research attribut the drop in larg part to increas train and oversight in recent year , although the studi did not specif look at interact with the mental ill .Polic shoot , the research found , had also drop , averag three a year from 2007 to 2014 , compar with eight a year from 2002 to 2005 .And alleg of excess forc by citizen declin by 74.2 percent from 2004 to 2014 , a decreas that Tim Prenzler , an adjunct professor of criminolog at Griffith Univers in Australia and the lead author of the studi , call a remark achievement. The research will appear in Journal of Criminolog Research , Polici and Practic .Offic Yakot , who ha been on the forc for nine year , said he thought that the department effort to shift cours had been larg success . But he ad : Do thing fall through the crack ? Yeah , it not perfect .

( Read an excerpt . )And inde , as Dr. Lasker watch group of American and Canadian volunt in match T-shirt surg through the Port-au-Princ airport two year after Haiti disastr 2010 earthquak , she wa remind of noth so much as the weekli Saturday turnov at American time-shar vacat resorts.Mani scholar have discuss the theori behind global aid and the variou peril in it execut . Dr. Lasker , a professor at Lehigh Univers , deliv instead a straightforward , data-driven review of a small health-rel fraction of the enterpris , aim to answer a few basic question : Do volunt help or hurt ?  she ask . In what way ? It turn out these question can not be answer , at least not veri precis . Still , anyon contempl a volunt stint is like to be interest in Dr. Lasker result , which amount to a sort of de facto best-practic manual .Ten of thousand of religi and secular institut now send hundr of thousand of health volunt from the Unit State out into the world , gener close to an estim $ 1 billion worth of unpaid labor . Volunt includ experienc medic profession and individu who can provid onli elbow greas ; between these extrem of compet are the hord of student in the health profess , among whom global volunt ha becom immens popular .Dr. Lasker present data from a few hundr program , glean from sever survey , dozen of interview and some brief trip of her own . ( She did not look at larg organ like Doctor Without Border , which are organ differ and gener do not use unpaid volunt . ) Most of the program she consid sponsor volunt assign that are quit short , last week rather than month , despit almost univers agreement among host commun that longer stay are much more help .The host gener have expect that are simpl enough : Volunt should do as they are ask , know enough about their destin not to violat local norm ( Women in short !  grumbl one African social worker ) , and understand that dirt , dust and discomfort are part of the experi .But even well-behav and unremark clad volunt may caus eddi of unintend disturb .Student may take advantag of the circumst to attempt task well beyond their expertis . Season profession may cling to standard of practic that are irrelev or imposs to sustain in poor countri . Unskil volunt who do not speak the languag may monopol local personnel with their interpret need without provid much of valu in return .Problem may lie with the structur of a program rather than the personnel . Volunt project may be choppi and discontinu , one set of volunt not know what the previou group wa up to , and not abl to leav suggest for the next group . Medic may run out . Surgeri may be perform with insuffici provis for postop care .Even well-organ program may undermin host commun in unanticip way : For instanc , a good volunteer-bas clinic may sap confid in local medic care and , provid free servic , threaten to put local physician out of busi .With all thi , do object evalu find that volunt activ actual help ? I did not expect how often the evalu question seem to take peopl by surpris ,  Dr. Lasker write .While the impact of surgic program can be obviou and dramat , effort at screen for diseas and diseas prevent are often far less so . A repres of one program memor told Dr. Lasker that they just know their work make a differ , while a sizabl minor of program attempt no formal analysi of their achiev .But inform evalu are inevit suspect . Host commun may feel it is onli polit to laud the result of such well-mean labor , Dr. Lasker write , and sometim the cite benefit are quit ephemer : less suspicion of doctor in a commun , for instanc . More than one of Dr. Lasker sourc muse that the most benefici aspect of the volunt effort might be the cash infus into a commun from the fee volunt usual pay .The benefit to the volunt themselv are equal difficult to pin down . Do they realli learn the true mean of chariti ? Are they realli transform into more educ global citizen ? A few studi on the long-term effect of short-term good work are ongo . In the meantim , there is littl evid that short-term volunt trip produc the kind of transform chang that are often promis ,  Dr. Lasker find .She wind up cautious endors short-term volunt work , provid the volunt choos care among program and behav respons while at work . Still , she suggest that return volunt be humble when it come to claim they have made a differ , either for other or for themselv .', 'John Hopkin said it wa set to perform the first kidney and liver transplant between H.I.V.-posit donor and H.I.V.-posit patient in the Unit State , a develop that advoc said could creat a lifesav pipelin for H.I.V . patient while shorten organ donor wait list for all .Dr. Dorri Segev , an associ professor of surgeri at the John Hopkin Univers School of Medicin , estim that organ from 500 to 600 H.I.V.-posit potenti donor have gone to wast each year and that allow those donat could save more than 1,000 peopl .Thatd be the greatest increas in organ transplant that wev seen in the past decad ,  he said in an interview Tuesday .Sinc 1988 until Novemb 2013 , when Presid Obama sign the H.I.V .

About 122,000 peopl in the Unit State are on the list , John Hopkin said .Patient without H.I.V . would not receiv organ from H.I.V.-posit donor .Give H.I.V.-posit patient donat organ wa onc consid unnecessari . The 2013 HOPE Act revers a transplant ban that wa pass in 1988  a time when AID fear were high  as part of an amend to the Nation Organ Transplant Act . Dr. David Klassen , the chief medic offic for the Unit Network for Organ Share , said the medic outlook for H.I.V . patient had drastic chang sinc then .Nobodi would consid transplant an H.I.V.-posit recipi becaus everyon knew their life span wa short ,  Dr. Klassen said . He ad that the notion that H.I.V.-posit recipi could be transplant aros as a result of their extend life spans.Becaus H.I.V.-posit organ transplant have never been done in the Unit State , medic facil do not have system in place to handl them , Dr. Segev said . He anticip a trickl of transplant at first until those system are establish , with the rate slowli tick upward .At least initi , the focu will be on deceas donor , Dr. Segev said .

In intern survey , peopl consist rank music as one of life suprem sourc of pleasur and emot power . We marri to music , graduat to music , mourn to music . Everi cultur ever studi ha been found to make music , and among the oldest artist object known are slender flute carv from mammoth bone some 43,000 year ago  24,000 year befor the cave paint of Lascaux .Given the antiqu , univers and deep popular of music , mani research had long assum that the human brain must be equip with some sort of music room , a distinct piec of cortic architectur dedic to detect and interpret the dulcet signal of song . Yet for year , scientist fail to find ani clear evid of a music-specif domain through convent brain-scan technolog , and the quest to understand the neural basi of a quintessenti human passion founder .Now research at the Massachusett Institut of Technolog have devis a radic new approach to brain imag that reveal what past studi had miss . By mathemat analyz scan of the auditori cortex and group cluster of brain cell with similar activ pattern , the scientist have identifi neural pathway that react almost exclus to the sound of music  ani music . It may be Bach , bluegrass , hip-hop , big band , sitar or Juli Andrew . A listen may relish the sampl genr or revil it . No matter . When a music passag is play , a distinct set of neuron tuck insid a furrow of a listener auditori cortex will fire in respons .Other sound , by contrast  a dog bark , a car skid , a toilet flush  leav the music circuit unmov .Nanci Kanwish and Josh H. McDermott , professor of neurosci at M.I.T. , and their postdoctor colleagu Sam Norman-Haigner report their result in the journal Neuron . The find offer research a new tool for explor the contour of human music .Whi do we have music ?  Dr. Kanwish said in an interview . Whi do we enjoy it so much and want to danc when we hear it ? How earli in develop can we see thi sensit to music , and is it tunabl with experi ? These are the realli cool first-ord question we can begin to address.Dr. McDermott said the new method could be use to comput dissect ani scan from a function magnet reson imag devic , or F.M.R.I .  the trendi workhors of contemporari neurosci  and so may end up divulg other hidden gem of cortic special . As proof of principl , the research show that their analyt protocol had detect a second neural pathway in the brain for which scientist alreadi had evid  thi one tune to the sound of human speech .Importantli , the M.I.T . team demonstr that the speech and music circuit are in differ part of the brain sprawl auditori cortex , where all sound signal are interpret , and that each is larg deaf to the other sonic cue , although there is some overlap when it come to respond to song with lyric .The new paper take a veri innov approach and is of great import ,  said Josef Rauscheck , director of the Laboratori of Integr Neurosci and Cognit at Georgetown Univers . The idea that the brain give special treatment to music recognit , that it regard music as fundament a categori as speech , is veri excit to me.In fact , Dr. Rauscheck said , music sensit may be more fundament to the human brain than is speech percept . There are theori that music is older than speech or languag ,  he said . Some even argu that speech evolv from music.And though the surviv valu that music held for our ancestor may not be as immedi obviou as the power to recogn word , Dr. Rauscheck ad , music work as a group cohes . Music-mak with other peopl in your tribe is a veri ancient , human thing to do.Elizabeth Hellmuth Marguli , the director of the Music Cognit Lab at the Univers of Arkansa , said that when previou neuroscientist fail to find ani anatom distinct music center in the brain , they came up with ani number of rational to explain the result .The stori wa , oh , what special about music percept is how it recruit area from all over the brain , how it draw on the motor system , speech circuitri , social understand , and bring it all togeth ,  she said . Some research dismiss music as auditori cheesecak ,  a pastim that co-opt other essenti commun urg . Thi paper say , no , when you peer below the cruder level seen with some methodolog , you find veri specif circuitri that respond to music over speech.Dr. Kanwisher lab is wide recogn for it pioneer work on human vision , and the discoveri that key portion of the visual cortex are prime to instantli recogn a few highli meaning object in the environ , like face and human bodi part . The research wonder if the auditori system might be similarli organ to make sens of the soundscap through a categor screen . If so , what would the salient categori be ? What are the aural equival of a human face or a human leg  sound or sound element so essenti the brain assign a bit of gray matter to the task of detect them ?To address the question , Dr. McDermott , a former club and radio disc jockey , and Dr. Norman-Haigner , an accomplish classic guitarist , began gather a librari of everyday sound  music , speech , laughter , weep , whisper , tire squeal , flag flap , dish clatter , flame crackl , wind chime tinkl . Wherev they went , they ask for suggest . Had they miss anyth ?They put the lengthi list up for a vote on the Amazon Mechan Turk crowdsourc servic to determin which of their candid sound were most easili recogn and frequent heard . That mass survey yield a set of 165 distinct and readili identifi sound clip of two second each ( listen to a select of them here ) . The research then scan the brain of 10 volunt ( none of them musician ) as they listen to multipl round of the 165 sound clip .Focus on the brain auditori region  locat , appropri enough , in the tempor lobe right abov the ear  the scientist analyz voxel , or three-dimension pixel , of the imag mathemat to detect similar pattern of neuron excit or quietud .The strength of our method is that it hypothesis-neutr ,  Dr. McDermott said . We just present a bunch of sound and let the data do the talking.The comput gener six basic respons pattern , six way the brain categor incom nois . But what did the categori correspond to ? Match sound clip to activ pattern , the research determin that four of the pattern were link to gener physic properti of sound , like pitch and frequenc . The fifth trace the brain percept of speech , and for the sixth the data turn operat , disclos a neuron hot spot in the major crevic , or sulcu , of the auditori cortex that attend to everi music clip the research had play .The sound of a solo drummer , whistl , pop song , rap , almost everyth that ha a music qualiti to it , melod or rhythmic , would activ it ,  Dr. Norman-Haigner said . That one reason the result surpris us . The signal of speech are so much more homogeneous.The research have yet to determin exactli which acoust featur of music stimul it dedic pathway . The rel constanc of a music note pitch ? It harmon overlay ? Even say what music is can be tricki .It difficult to come up with a dictionari definit ,  Dr. McDermott said . I tend to think music is best defin by example.Justic Potter Stewart of the Suprem Court likewis said of pornographi that he knew it when he saw it .

Longstand conflict in the deep jungl of the eastern Democrat Republ of Congo left expert with no choic but to guess at how that gorilla subspeci may be fare .Now , with tension abat somewhat , research final have an updat gorilla head count  one that confirm their fear . Accord to find compil by an intern team of conservationist , Grauer gorilla popul have plummet 77 percent over the last 20 year , with fewer than 3,800 of the anim remain .We suspect that the Grauer gorilla had declin becaus of all the insecur in the region , but no one had an idea of how much theyd declin by ,  said Andrew Plumptr , director of the Wildlif Conserv Society Albertin Rift Program in Central and Eastern Africa . It turn out that the rate of collaps push thi subspeci to the verg of extinction.Grauer gorilla  name after Rudolf Grauer , an Austrian explor and zoologist who first recogn the ape as a separ subspeci  resembl their close rel , the mountain gorilla , save for their longer limb and shorter hair . Although Grauer and mountain gorilla popul were onc connect , year of isol have left them genet distinct enough to warrant separ design as eastern gorilla subspeci .In 1994 , the Wildlif Conserv Societi conduct survey in and around Kahuzi-Biega Nation Park , in what wa then eastern Zair . Research estim that 17,000 Grauer gorilla remain . But the Rwandan genocid that year led to the gorillas precipit declin .An estim 800,000 Rwandan were kill over a three-month period , while hundr of thousand more fled to neighbor Zair . Some of those refuge form militia such as the Democrat Forc for the Liber of Rwanda , and the forest serv as their stronghold and hide-out .Instabl soon spread , lead to the overthrow of Presid Mobutu Sese Seko and civil war in the newli form Democrat Republ of Congo . From 1996 to 2003 , that conflict cost the live of an estim five million peopl , and also brought the format of more arm group , 69 of which continu to oper in the eastern part of the countri .Bushmeat feed mani of them , and gorilla , which can weigh up to 400 pound , prove easi and worthwhil target . To financ their effort , mani arm group have also set up artisan mine site , nearli all illeg .The Intern Peac Inform Servic , an independ research institut base in Belgium , ha document more than 1,000 of these mine , and the Wildlif Conserv Societi ha count at least 240 more within protect area and propos protect area . The mine attract untold number of outsid worker , who also need to eat .Although the fight ha eb somewhat over the last five year , the region today is by no mean secur for peopl or for anim . Eastern Congo i just tragic on everi level imagin ,  said Liz Williamson , a primatologist at the Univers of Stirl in Scotland . Peopl there have been live through hell for 20 years.Those tri to protect the region flora and fauna are equal at risk . The Wildlif Conserv Societi estim that 170 to 200 park ranger have been kill in eastern Congo sinc 1996 .The govern ha been tri to go into some area to disarm all these group , but it not an easi job ,  Dr. Plumptr said . In that larg of a chunk of forest , find peopl is difficult.Despit the danger , over the last few year , field team of local resid , park staff member and scientist have manag to undertak the most comprehens survey of Grauer gorilla ever , cover 7,450 mile of their rang . Statist analys allow Dr. Plumptr and hi colleagu to estim a total remain popul of fewer than 3,800 .All told , the research calcul a 77 percent declin in Grauer gorilla popul sinc 1994 , although some site were hit harder than other . In and around Kahuzi-Biega Nation Park , for exampl , there ha been an 87 percent declin .Addit , nearli 80 percent of the total loss took place over just one gener  a rate three time higher than what is normal need to offici declar an anim on the brink of extinct . Should thi trend continu , most Grauer gorilla will be gone within the next five to 10 year , Dr. Plumptr said .Grauer gorilla are list as endang by the Intern Union for Conserv of Natur , but Dr. Plumptr and hi colleagu believ that their situat warrant immedi updat to critic endang statu . Dr. Williamson submit evid thi month support that chang , and she expect approv by June .While kill gorilla is alreadi illeg in the countri , declar the subspeci as critic endang would probabl bring more fund and support for save it . Protect the entireti of the gorilla 7,700-square-mil territori would no doubt prove imposs , but Dr. Plumptr and hi colleagu are talk with the govern and commun leader about establish two new protect area that would encompass 60 percent of the remain gorillas habitat .I think peopl felt like thi wa a lost caus and not much could be done ,  Dr. Williamson said . But now W.C. . is realli push to get boot on the ground and creat these new nation park , which would realli make a difference.Govern commit to save the gorilla , she ad , is essenti .There is some evid that heighten protect and invest could work . In their survey , the research found that one gorilla popul , in the highland sector of Kahuzi-Biega Nation Park , ha increas to an estim 200 from about 130 in 2000 . That sector receiv the most protect in the eastern nation park , and even welcom tourist .Thi show that if you do invest in a site , you can stop the declin ,  Dr. Plumptr said .The research also plan to set up microcredit scheme  small loan with minim interest that are intend to help peopl live in poverti set up busi  and employ opportun for peopl from local commun who are involv in mine . Addit , they hope to establish a certif program for legitim mine site .Some Western compani like Motorola , Nokia , BlackBerri , HP and Intel alreadi work with a group call Solut for Hope to acquir conflict-fre miner . Dr. Plumptr imagin updat the conflict-fre miner list to includ a bushmeat-free or conservation-friendly valid .If peopl start lobbi for gorilla-friendli cellphon and iPad , it would forc the govern of D.R.C . to take thi more serious ,  he said .Radar Nishuli , the director of Kahuzi-Biega Nation Park , agre that more engag from peopl outsid the Democrat Republ of Congo wa need . All of the world need to support our effort to save what still left of the gorilla and their forest habitat , and to help the Congo get out of thi war situat ,  Dr. Nishuli said .I am optimist that gorilla can still multipli , to the delight of all ,  he ad . If I wasnt , I would have alreadi given up thi fight.', 'Im not claustrophob or fidgeti . I love music , though Im not a musician . For all the time I had written about neurosci studi that reli on the brain-map techniqu call function magnet reson imag , or F.M.R.I. , I had never seen a scan perform .

Take me through the experi recent report in the journal Neuron and show me where in the brain  my brain  the music-specif pathway resid . Let me lie in the dark , narrow chamber of the scanner with my head brace in place as I listen to a seri of care select sound clip .I assur her the enclos quarter would not make me panic . I promis I would give good , clean data , by remain as still as roadkil and avoid the littl head wiggl that are the bane of F.M.R.I . research . Dr. Kanwish agre to my request , and I wa usher to the scan room , in the basement , by Sam Norman-Haigner , a postdoctor fellow and an author on the new report , who is thin and light-ey and look a littl like a Renaiss troubadour , and Alex Kell , a graduat student with a cheer smile and a blond beard .A magnet reson imag devic use radio wave and power magnet field to track blood flow in the brain , an indirect measur of neural activ .

Not to worri : Theyd be fine .And so , outfit with custom , scanner-compat headphon that would pipe in the sound clip and muffl the deafen clank of the vibrat coil , I settl onto a glide platform bed to be convey into the cylindr bowel of the $ 3 million machin , and the experi began .For 90 minut , I listen to 25 sound clip , each two-second stimulus play three time in a row , follow by the mute bang of the coil , a quiet interregnum , and then on to the next thrice-play clip .I heard the sound of a depart airplan , a cheer crowd , liquid be pour into a cup , a friski banjo riff that I wa sure had been taken from the bluegrass classic Rocki Top. I heard a woman speak German , anoth speak French and a third whisper loudli , They have anoth shot at the deal. I heard what I thought wa a ball roll in a roulett wheel , but I later learn it wa a chair roll on a floor . I heard a littl girl declar , The mommi goe to the hospit !  and a man yell , sitcom New Yawki style , On top of that , I work for her father for 20 year !  I heard fragment of classic piano and mariachi trumpet , the rasp of techno danc .I heard these sound over and over , in differ order . I dreamili wonder if they defin my life . I kept my promis and didnt budg . As scan subject go , Mr. Kell later compliment me : Your just like one of us.After calcul the rel intens of each voxel , or three-dimension pixel , on the scan of the auditori portion of my brain , Dr. Norman-Haigner show me the result . Insid a major groov , or sulcu , that run through the auditori cortex , there wa a hot spot of music select ,  he said , abov and a littl forward of the ear . I had a second , smaller music hot spot toward the back of my head , which at first I hope wa evid of my except music , until Dr. Norman-Haigner told me they saw a similar backup circuit in nearli half the subject test . My speech-specif hot spot sat just below my ear .The research are now explor the music pathway in greater detail . The first round of scan subject were , like me , nonmusician .

The citizen scienc project is run by the Cornel Lab of Ornitholog , the Nation Audubon Societi and Bird Studi of Canada . It is current in it 19th year and will last from Feb. 12 until Feb. 15 .Last year more than 140,000 peopl from more than 100 countri classifi nearli half of the world bird type dure the four-day event . Includ in the 5,090 differ speci identifi in 2015 were two new bird speci , the millpo tapaculo and Santa Marta screech-owl , which had never befor been describ in a scientif journal .Common among the count includ the thousand of northern cardin , blue jay and American goldfinch that frequent birdfeed and serenad garden year-round in the Unit State . More rare were sight of the great hornbil in India , the Pincoya storm-petrel in Chile and the golden-cheek warbler in Hondura , accord to Marshal Iliff , an ornithologist from Cornel .Interest bird-watch can join thi weekend count by use their smartphon or a paper and pen to jot down everi bird they see in an area for at least 15 minut . They can then upload their find to the project websit . Detail such as color and behavior are use to ornitholog sleuth in determin which bird breed are present . Data from the count contribut to other citizen scienc project , such as eBird , and help scientist learn more about how avian popul cope with climat chang and harsh weather condit .The event also includ a photo contest that featur fanci plumag from across the globe .', 'Recent , I found myself with a book contract and a deadlin to produc 80,000 word , so I turn to some author friend for advic .

Care plan had crumbl as they had encount unexpect turn in their research and think .After read Wire to Creat ,  by Scott Barri Kaufman and Carolyn Gregoir , Im inclin to think that these writer took the right path .Research into the natur of creativ ha explod the past 50 year , and scientist are find that it rare a well-defin , step-by-step process .

Some of the most test  go for a walk , take a shower , let your mind wander  are not revolutionari . The book contain too mani platitud  Inspir favor the prepar mind  oversimplifi list and seemingli arbitrari rule of thumb , and these flaw could have made it anoth forgett tome in the vast librari on creativ .Instead , Wire to Create rise abov these shortcom by emphas the complex and contradict that distinguish creativ peopl . Insight problem solv cant be boil down to ani singl way of think ,  the author say . Creativ peopl have messi process , and often messi mind , full of contradict .Contrari to the well-worn notion that creativ resid in the right side of the brain , research show that creativ is a product of the whole brain , reli especi on what the author call the imagin network  circuit devot to task like make person mean , creat mental simul and take perspect .While creativ peopl run the gamut of person , Dr. Kaufman research ha shown that open to experi is more highli correl to creativ output than I.Q. , diverg think or ani other person trait . Thi open often yield a drive for explor , which may be the singl most import person factor predict creativ achiev ,  the author write .These are peopl energ and motiv by the possibl of discov new inform : It the thrill of the knowledg chase that most excit them.Onc the idea is found , ala , the creativ process begin to resembl someth more like grind execut . It still creativ , but it requir more focu and less daydream  one reason highli creativ peopl tend to exhibit mind and mental wander .Creativ is a process that reflect our fundament chaotic and multifacet natur ,  the author write . It is both deliber and uncontrol , mind and mindless , work and play.On Jan. 2 , the novelist Georg R.R . Martin announc that he had miss hi ( alreadi delay ) deadlin for The Wind of Winter ,  the highli anticip sixth book in hi best-sel fantasi seri Game of Thrones. The sixth season of the HBO seri will proceed without a complet version of the book it base on .I tri , I promis you . I fail ,  the author told fan on hi blog . Truth be told , sometim the write goe well and sometim it doesnt.Perhap Mr. Martin ha adopt the mind-set that the author Denis Shekerjian identifi among the 40 MacArthur grant recipi she interview for her 1990 book , Uncommon Geniu : How Great Idea Are Born. Ms. Shekerjian call it stay loos ,  a way of embrac the uncertainti inher in the creativ process , often without regard for practic or efficiency.The magic moment of epiphani , Ms. Shekerjian wrote , often follow an extend period of uncertainti . Sometim , the write just doesnt go well  and then suddenli it doe . Accord to Dr. Kaufman and Ms. Gregoir , the abil to toler and embrac the discomfort of thi process is a hallmark of creativ peopl .Those murki , ambigu place , as highli imagin peopl well know , are quit often where the creativ magic happens.', 'For all the havoc that zebra mussel , Asian carp , round gobi and dozen of other alien speci have wrought on the Great Lake , those water have never known a foe like the sea lamprey . The vampirelik parasit cost mani million each year in deplet fisheri and erad effort .Wildlif manag have long use lampricid  the lamprey version of pesticid  with mix result . Now , an innov control program seek to improv on that method by use pheromon to trick the bloodsuck into voluntarili corral themselv in design area , to then be trap or poison . But achiev thi depend on crack the fish olfactori languag .The broad goal is to understand how thi anim make decis ,  said Michael Wagner , a fish ecologist at Michigan State Univers . Then , we want to use that understand to guid lampreys movement by manipul the landscap of fear and opportunity.Lamprey look like the stuff of horror film : a slither , tubular bodi top with a suction-cup mouth ring with row upon row of hook yellow teeth . With thi mouth , a sea lamprey anchor to it fish prey and use it rasp tongu to drill into the victim flesh . It remain there for up to a month , feed on blood and bodi fluid . Even if a fish surviv the attack , the gape wound left behind often result in death .In their natur rang , lamprey are import compon of food web . The problem begin onli when they shift from nativ to invad .Sea lamprey slip into Lake Ontario through the Eri Canal in the mid-19th centuri , and then made it past Niagara Fall around 1919 with the renov of the Welland Canal . In the lake , lamprey found a utopia : no predat , and bounti prey that had no natur defens against their voraci appetit . Biolog disast ensu . By 1940 , lamprey had colon the entir Great Lake system . Harvest of lake trout fell from around 18 million pound a year to less than 300,000 pound ; other speci , especi whitefish , also took signific blow . Uncheck , lamprey kill an estim 110 million pound of fish each year .Desper to find solut , Canada and the Unit State in 1955 establish the Great Lake Fisheri Commiss . It research test nearli 7,000 chemic on lamprey larva and fish to identifi one that would kill the invad , with minim effect on other fish . Eventu , they settl on 3-trifluoromethyl 4-nitrophenol , or TFM , a metabolism-target poison appli to larvae-infest stream . At the same time , the commiss built about 70 lamprey barrier to limit migrat .Lamprey number in the lake soon plummet by 90 to 95 percent , spare some 100 million pound of fish each year . But that success requir continu effort . Today , the commiss spend around $ 20 million annual on lamprey control , mostli to appli TFM to about 100 stream , where it ha a 98 percent success rate in kill larva . The poison , howev , is not perfect ; there are occasion mishap with nativ fish . In 2014 , for exampl , it inadvert kill 32 juvenil sturgeon , a protect speci .Reli on one chemic also put manag in a precari posit . A fire could destroy the suppli , the price could go up , or lamprey could develop a resist to lampricid ,  said Marc Gaden , spokesman for the Great Lake Fisheri Commiss .Dr. Gaden , Dr. Wagner and other say that pheromon could allevi some of the relianc on poison . Wer tri to move away from brute-forc techniqu like pesticid and achiev the most environment friendli control of lamprey possibl ,  Dr. Wagner said .Research have been investig lamprey pheromon sinc the 1980 , though record from the late 19th centuri show that French fisher suspect that lamprey use odor to attract mate . In fact , pheromon seem to play a promin role throughout the lamprey life cycl .Like salmon , lamprey spawn in river and stream , but instead of return to the place of their birth , they use the scent of current larva  which burrow into the muck and remain there around four year befor metamorphos into parasit and move into open water  to determin where to deposit their own young . It like choos where to rais your kid base on a neighborhood crime rate and qualiti of school ,  Dr. Wagner said . The odor larva releas say , Wer thrive here.Male lamprey follow their nose to larvae-fil stream ahead of femal . There , they construct a cradl of small stone ( the name lamprey possibl deriv from the Latin lampetra , or stone licker ) and then pump out a concoct of come-hith chemic to guid femal to their love nest . After spawn , both parent die .Make larva is not the onli way the parasit use scent , howev . Research also suspect that lamprey tissu contain an alarm cue , which warn other to steer clear of injur or dead lamprey . When Dr. Wagner pour just a few drop of a solut extract from decay lamprey into a tank of live one , their frenzi respons make it appear as if someon just flip on a blender .The research hope to use synthes version of these three chemic class to hack lampreys natur behavior , creat a push-pull mean of control , with the alarm pheromon nudg the anim away from certain area , the migrat and sex one reel them in . Lamprey male could be trick into select subpar stream , femal could be sent down dead end , and all could be manipul for more cost-effect poison and trap . Such pheromone-driven strategi have long been use for insect , but never for a vertebr speci .It turn out that the principl of control for insect also hold for lamprey ,  said Jim Miller , an entomologist at Michigan State who serv on the fisheri commission board as a pest manag advis .The most signific develop is the Environment Protect Agency Decemb registr of 3kPZ , a male sex pheromon identifi by Weim Li , a physiologist at Michigan State and the guru of sex-attract lamprey pheromon ,  accord to Dr. Miller .Dr. Li and hi colleagu began by search for chemic differ in water sampl taken from tank hold immatur and matur male lamprey . One compound  later identifi as 3kPZ stood out . They purifi the mysteri compound and found that , when it wa appli to lamprey nose , electrod regist activ in their sensori tissu .They found that natur and synthes version of the compound elicit the same olfactori respons in captiv lamprey .Final , they confirm that femal respond to the synthes pheromon in field experi . We could actual see the anim move upstream as the odor wa be pump into the water , then drift downstream when we stop ,  Dr. Li said . If you were stand there watch that anim , you would have been so excit to see scienc work so well.The research hope thi success will pave the way for other synthet lamprey pheromon , eventu let them concoct sever biolog perfum convinc enough to fool wild lamprey . Thi is the begin of what could potenti be a new era in invas speci control ,  Dr. Gaden said .The same technolog may serv as a conserv tool in other part of the world  includ Western Europ and the West Coast of the Unit States where nativ lamprey are in precipit declin becaus of dam and habitat degrad .But these strategi ultim depend on the researchers abil to teas out the fish biolog secret .Anim are alway more sophist than we think ,  Dr. Miller said . Effect manag them take a full hand of card play in a smart way  not just one ace and youv got them.', 'The Zika viru ha quickli gain Ebola-level notorieti as it ha spread through the Western Hemispher in recent month . Research in Brazil , where it wa first detect in May , have link infect in pregnant women to a condit known as microcephali : infant born with unders head .Where birth defect are concern , howev , the Zika viru is far from uniqu . A number of other virus , such as rubella and cytomegaloviru , pose a seriou risk dure pregnanc . Research have uncov some import clue about how those pathogen injur fetus  find that are now help to guid research into the potenti link between Zika and microcephali .I think well discov a lot of parallel ,  said Dr. Mark R. Schleiss , the director of pediatr infecti diseas and immunolog at the Univers of Minnesota Medic School .The risk that virus pose dure pregnanc came to light in the mid-1900 , when outbreak of rubella , or German measl , led to wave of birth defect , includ microcephali , cataract and deform heart and liver .The number of infant affect wa stagger . In an epidem in Philadelphia in 1965 , 1 percent of all babi were born with congenit rubella syndrom , which can also caus deaf , development disabl , low birth weight and seizur .Becaus of vaccin , such devast is now rare in the Unit State and a number of other countri . Im 52 , and Iv seen one case of congenit rubella syndrom ,  said Dr. David W. Kimberlin , a professor of pediatr at the Univers of Alabama at Birmingham .But the viru is still a grave threat in develop countri . Worldwid , more than 100,000 children are born each year with congenit rubella syndrom .Other virus have also been identifi as caus birth defect . Cytomegaloviru , for exampl , contribut to at least 5,000 birth defect each year in the Unit State alon .Doctor do not systemat screen for cytomegaloviru and other well-known viral threat , and it can be difficult to pin down the link to birth defect . Unless the virus strike in sudden outbreak , their effect can be hard to teas out from other caus of birth defect .As a result , the true scale of virus-caus birth defect remain unknown .I dont think we have a good estim of the number that are due to congenit infect ,  said Peggi Honein , an epidemiologist at the Center for Diseas Control and Prevent .Understand how certain virus infect fetus ha been a major challeng for scientist . Cytomegaloviru infect onli human : To studi the diseas in , say , guinea pig , research have had to use a speci of cytomegaloviru that infect onli guinea pig .Recent , howev , scientist have figur out how to grow human cytomegaloviru in human cell cultur . These studi have help to show that when a pregnant woman is infect by the viru , it doe not immedi strike the fetu .Lenor Pereira , a virologist at the Univers of California , San Francisco , and other research have document a long seri of step that the viru must take to complet thi journey . Thi can take week ,  she said .Cytomegalviru first infect the wall of the uteru . Then it move to the placenta  but the viru attack onli certain type of placent cell .From the placenta , the viru can travel into the amniot sac , and then to the fetu itself .If cytomegaloviru reach the fetu earli in develop , the infect can caus seriou harm , especi to the brain . The fetus immun system ha bare develop at that point , while the brain is alreadi grow rapidli .Onc cytomegaloviru enter the fetal brain , it wait for a few day . Onli after the brain ha begun to matur do the virus start multipli insid stem cell that will later give rise to neuron .The process seem suspici well time to some research . It might be a strategi not to kill the host ,  said Dr. Dana G. Wolf , the director of the Clinic Virolog Unit at Hadassah Hebrew Univers Medic Center in Jerusalem .In Brazil , scientist are compar the brain damag in babi perhap caus by the Zika viru with what is known of the effect of cytomegaloviru and rubella . Some find in our patient are strikingli differ ,  said Lavinia Schuler-Faccini of the Feder Univers of Rio Grand do Sul .Zika viru appear to caus more widespread damag in the brain , Dr. Schuler-Faccini said . She ha observ that the surfac of some of the microcephal brain is unusu smooth  a symptom not seen in infect of rubella or cytomegaloviru .She hypothes that the viru infect fetus veri earli in develop , creat a bigger disrupt to cell as they give rise to the brain .Dr. Gil G. Mor , the director of reproduct scienc at Yale Univers School of Medicin , said that scientist should not rule out the possibl that the Zika viru caus damag without ever infect fetus .He and hi colleagu have found evid for such indirect damag by infect pregnant mice with herpeslik virus . The virus never got past the placenta to infect the fetu  yet somehow the mother gave birth to pup with brain deform .When certain virus attack the placenta , Dr. Mor said , they may spark a power immun respons from the mother . Inflammation-trigg molecul spread from the infect , and some may end up in the fetu . It tissu may then swell and becom damag , and may even die off .Dr. Mor said he suspect that the brain of fetus could be especi vulner to thi kind of bystand damag earli in develop . Whatev come from Mom goe to the brain , good or bad ,  he said .As a result , Dr. Mor ad , research look for proof that Zika virus caus birth defect should not limit their search to virus in children with deform . You may look and not find it ,  he said .Koen Van Rompay , a virologist at the Univers of California , Davi , is also look for Zika viru  but not in human . Instead , he and hi colleagu are prepar to infect pregnant monkey to see how their offspr are affect .If they discov birth defect , they will investig whether the viru is directli invad the fetus or caus a harm immun respons in the mother .Let be on the safe side and keep both side open ,  Dr. Van Rompay said .The lesson that scientist have gain from virus like rubella and cytomegaloviru could also point to potenti treatment .If we understand how the viru infect cell , we can come up with way to suppress it ,  Dr. Pereira said . Studi of cytomegaloviru , for exampl , suggest that it may be possibl to block birth defect by inject a mother with antibodi befor the viru reach the fetu .Dr. Mor said that the attent now focus on the Zika viru may make scientist appreci just how much virus could affect fetal health .Along with deform that are present at birth , these infect can also have effect on children that emerg later . Children as old as 8 , for exampl , can go deaf from cytomegaloviru infect their mother had dure pregnanc .The effect of a mother respons to virus may also be of enorm import , but right now , scientist understand them much less . Some studi have hint that viral infect dure fetal develop can rais a child risk of develop autism or schizophrenia . It will take mani year , and much more evid , to evalu those link .We can not ignor infect dure pregnanc ,  Dr. Mor said . Thi is more than Zika.', 'Q . If it is natur for the bodi to sweat to get rid of toxin ( and to cool itself ) , can antiperspir harm the bodi ?A . Sweat gland do have an import role in elimin undesir substanc from the bodi , but block a few sweat gland under the armpit doe not have a signific impact on the overal excret of sweat ,  said Dr. Hooman Khorasani , an assist professor of dermatolog at the Icahn School of Medicin at Mount Sinai . Other organ are involv in elimin wast as well , he said .Antiperspir are aluminum salt that form a gel with sweat and occlud the duct of sweat gland , Dr. Khorasani said . Therefor , some sweat is absorb by the dermi , the thicker layer of the skin beneath the epidermi , and is not excret .Sweat gland do play a major role in elimin potenti harm substanc , even excess prescript drug , as well as in control temperatur , Dr. Khorasani said . The gland are distribut all over the bodi , not just under the arm .Our bodi also produc urea , which is the nitrogen byproduct of protein metabol ,  he said . Luckili , the sweat gland are not the onli way of elimin urea , as the kidney do most of the elimin . Therefor , there is not a signific buildup of biolog wast with the use of antiperspirants. question @ nytimes.com', 'Health offici in sever countri stricken by the Zika viru have given their femal citizen an unpreced warn : Dont get pregnant.Thi startl advic ha been greet in mani quarter with a mix of shock and deris . Medic historian said they had never heard the like . Advoc for women mock it as unrealist , disconnect from the difficult live of women in a part of the world where contracept can be hard to obtain and abort is often illeg .Yet a grow number of infecti diseas expert say that delay pregnanc could work  and may be the most effect way to break the back of thi global epidem .Such a strategi would not stop the spread of mild ill that Zika caus in adult , or the surg in case of Guillain-Barr syndrom paralysi link to those .But wait through at least one hot , wet , high-transmiss season may save thousand of newborn from Zika terrifi suspect consequ : abnorm small head and brain damag .Dr. William Schaffner , the chief of prevent medicin at Vanderbilt Univers Medic School , even suggest that the Brazilian Armi , which is set to go door to door thi week look for mosquito breed spot and hand out pamphlet , ought to hand out condom , too .There will be pushback becaus it a Cathol countri ,  he said . But it would send a messag : Defer your pregnanc ; be cautiou now so you can avoid the hazard.Nonpregn women who are bitten , infect and recov becom immun  and can later have a babi safe , expert said . And if everyon around a young woman becom immun that way , she is safer even if she is not immun becaus mosquito can not get the viru from them to give to her  what is known as herd immunity.In addit , Dr. Schaffner and other research said , if women can delay get pregnant for as long as two year , a vaccin may arriv .Even if women wait for just a year , there will probabl be a big impact ,  said Scott Weaver , an expert on the Zika viru at the Univers of Texa Medic Branch in Galveston .Five Latin American and Caribbean countri have advis pregnanc delay , for differ period of time .In Brazil , Dr. Claudio Maierovitch , head of surveil for the Health Ministri , suggest in Decemb that women in the most Zika-infest area postpon have children indefinit . Offici in Ecuador recent did the same .Colombia health minist , Alejandro Gaviria , urg women to wait six to eight month . Jamaica Health Ministri suggest wait up to a year . And El Salvador ask women to wait until 2018 .The World Health Organ , howev , is not endors the idea at the moment .Theoret , mani have thought it may work ,  said Dr. Bruce Aylward , the organization chief of emerg respons . But he said that the organization posit for now is that the best approach is to keep fight the mosquito while work on a vaccin .Yet there is wide acknowledg that mosquito control in Latin America and the Caribbean is fail . No countri or territori south of the continent Unit State ha been abl to stop dengu or chikungunya , which are spread by Aed aegypti , the same mosquito that transmit Zika viru .In respons to call for delay pregnanc , women group have point out that mani are unplan or the result of rape or incest , and that birth control and abort are often illeg or difficult to obtain .In El Salvador , the recommend to postpon pregnanc is offens to women and even more ridicul in the context of strict abort law and high level of sexual violenc against girl and women ,  Monica Roa , the vice presid for strategi at Women Link Worldwid , a women right group , told Reuter .Diseas expert conced that those problem are real , especi for teenag . But marri women , especi those with a child or two and a relationship with a gynecologist , often can exercis some control over their pregnanc , expert argu , and husband may cooper becaus they do not want disabl children .They note that birth per woman have fallen significantli despit Roman Cathol opposit to birth control and abort  a trend foreshadow in Itali , Spain and Portug .The data back that up  fertil rate have drop ,  said Dr. Albert I. Ko , a Yale School of Public Health infecti diseas specialist who work in Brazil .Accord to the Guttmach Institut , a research organ , mani marri women in some of the affect countri practic what it call modern methods of birth control . In Colombia , the figur is 73 percent ; in Brazil and the Dominican Republ , 70 percent ; in El Salvador and Paraguay , 61 percent ; in Ecuador , 58 percent .In other countri , howev , the rate are lower , and the challeng will be greater . In Guatemala , it is 34 percent ; in Bolivia , 32 percent ; in Haiti , a mere 24 percent .Expert liken the idea of let nonpregn women be infect to the day befor rubella vaccin , when some mother let their young daughter play with rubella-stricken children becaus it wa mild in childhood but could devast a young woman babi .Howev , no countri ha openli advis it women to be bitten , becaus the risk of Guillain-Barr paralysi , while small , exist .The most complic problem , scientist said , wa that no one know exactli how much of a popul must be sick and recov to creat herd immun .The viru move quickli , suggest that immun would build quickli .Yap Island , in Micronesia , had a 2007 Zika outbreak that last less than six month but infect 73 percent of the popul , presum immun all of them . Other Pacif Island outbreak peter out in five to eight month , suggest a tip point had been reach .A soon as one case give rise to less than one secondari case , the outbreak will declin and ultim end ,  said Dr. Marc Lecuit , a Zika expert at the Pasteur Institut in Pari .Someth similar happen on Caribbean island after chikungunya hit them in 2013 . Outbreak fade , suggest that herd immun wa strong , when onli 20 percent to 50 percent of the popul wa immun , Dr. Ko said . He did add that unusu dri weather , which slow mosquito reproduct , might have play a role .It is not clear , howev , that lesson learn on island can be appli on a huge , climat divers contin like South America .Although Zika ha virtual disappear from most of the Polynesian island it swept through , it could establish itself on the contin as an endem diseas , return everi summer .That ha happen in the Unit State . West Nile viru began in New York in 1999 and soar to a peak of 10,000 seriou case and 264 death in 2003 .It then fade  presum becaus mani American were immun becaus , as with Zika viru , 80 percent never show symptom but do build antibodi . But it persist , at lower level , and sometim flare up , as it did in Texa in 2012 , becaus there is still no vaccin .That uncertainti make it hard to give women accur advic on how long to delay pregnanc .Tell peopl , Next year might be better ,  might be good advic or it might be mislead , becaus we dont know how safe it will be ,  said Dr. Ernesto T.A . Marqu Jr. , a Brazilian vaccin research base at the Univers of Pittsburgh .A more sophist approach , he said , would be to advis women to avoid pregnanc each year from March through May , the intens mosquito season . Infect dure the first trimest appear to pose the biggest danger .Advis women to put off pregnanc for a year or two or more interfer in relationship ,  he said .', 'Dr. Caleb Alexand know how easili older peopl can fall into so-cal polypharmaci . Perhap a patient , like most senior , see sever specialist who write or renew prescript .A cardiologist put someon on good , evidence-bas medic for hi heart ,  said Dr. Alexand , co-director of the John Hopkin Center for Drug Safeti and Effect . An endocrinologist doe the same for hi bones.And let say the patient , like mani older adult , also use an over-the-count reflux drug and take a daili aspirin or a zinc supplement and fish oil capsul .Pretti soon , you have an 82-year-old man who on 14 medic ,  Dr. Alexand said , bare exagger .Geriatrician and research have warn for year about the potenti hazard of polypharmaci , usual defin as take five or more drug concurr . Yet it continu to rise in all age group , reach disturbingli high level among older adult .It as perenni as the grass ,  Dr. Alexand said . The averag senior is take more medicin than ever before.Track prescript drug use from 1999 to 2012 through a larg nation survey , Harvard research report in Novemb that 39 percent of those over age 65 now use five or more medic  a 70 percent increas in polypharmaci over 12 year .Lot of factor probabl contribut , includ the introduct of Medicar Part D drug coverag in 2006 and treatment guidelin that ( controversi ) call for greater use of statin .But older peopl dont take just prescript drug . An articl publish in JAMA Intern Medicin , use a longitudin nation survey of peopl 62 to 85 , may have reveal the fuller pictur .More than a third were take at least five prescript medic , and almost two-third were use dietari supplement , includ herb and vitamin . Nearli 40 percent took over-the-count drug .Not all are imperil by polypharmaci , of cours . But some of those product , even those that sound natur and are avail at health food store , interact with other and can caus danger side effect .How often doe that happen ? The research , analyz the drug and supplement taken , calcul that more than 8 percent of older adult in 2005 and 2006 were at risk for a major drug interact . Five year later , the proport exceed 15 percent .Wer not pay attent to the interact and safeti of multipl medic ,  said Dima Qato , the lead author of the JAMA Intern Medicin articl ( Dr. Alexand wa a co-author ) and a pharmacist and epidemiologist at the Univers of Illinoi at Chicago . Thi is a major public health problem.She wa stun to discov , for instanc , that the use of omega-3 fish oil supplement had quadrupl over five year . Her research suggest that almost one in five older adult now take them .User probabl believ fish oil help their heart . But Dr. Qato point out fish oil capsul lack regul and evid of effect , and can caus bleed in patient take blood thinner like warfarin ( brand name : Coumadin ) .Though drug interact can occur in ani age group , older peopl are more vulner , said Dr. Michael A. Steinman , a geriatrician at the Univers of California , San Francisco , who wrote an accompani commentari .Most have multipl chronic diseas , so they take more drug , put them at higher risk for threaten interact .The consequ can also be more threaten . Say a drug make older patient dizzi .Theyr more prone to fall , becaus they dont have the same reserv of balanc and strength as the young or middle-ag , Dr. Steinman said . And if they do fall becaus theyr dizzi , theyr more like to get hurt.Some common combin that crop up in the studi and could spell troubl : aspirin and the anti-clot drug clopidogrel ( Plavix ) , both blood thinner that togeth increas the risk of bleed with long-term use ; aspirin and naproxen ( Alev ) , over-the-count drug that when combin can caus bleed , ulcer or perfor of the stomach line .Dr. Qato recal review the medic of a 67-year-old man take both the cholesterol drug simvastatin ( Zocor ) and the blood pressur medic amlodipin ( Norvasc )  the most common combin of interact drug that emerg in her studi .Statin , along with their cholesterol-low properti , can caus muscl pain and weak ; Norvasc heighten that risk . A differ blood pressur drug  there are mani altern  would be a safer choic , Dr. Qato said . Yet almost 4 percent of the older adult in her studi took both drug .Moreov , though her patient wasnt experienc problem , he wa also take garlic and omega-3 supplement , which can interact with prescript medic .Did you tell your doctor you were on them ?  Dr. Qato recal ask . He said , No , whi should I ? If it wa import , whi didnt he ask me ? A reason question . A recent studi in JAMA Intern Medicin , howev , found that more than 42 percent of adult didnt tell their primari care doctor about their most commonli use complementari and altern medicin , includ a quarter of those who reli most on herb and supplement .Usual , that wa becaus the physician didnt ask and the patient didnt think they need to know ; in a few case , doctor had previous discourag altern therapi , or patient thought they would .And they might , especi for older patient with complex regimen . Im not a big fan of supplement ,  Dr. Alexand tell patient take lot of vitamin , supplement and herbal remedi .I think the vast major of evid rais seriou question about their effect or , in some case , their safeti . Theyr less well regul than prescript medic . I think youd be better off stop them.Patient often resist , he said , and theyr the captain of their own ship. So he explain the risk and benefit , and negoti ensu .Often , though , patient dont know that a daili aspirin , Prilosec OTC or fish oil can interact with other drug . Or theyr confus about what theyr actual take .Dr. Steinman recal ask a patient to bring in everi pill he took for a so-cal brown bag review . He learn that the man had accumul four or five bottl of the same drug without realiz it , and wa ingest sever time the recommend dose .Ultim , the best way to reduc polypharmaci is to overhaul our fragment approach to health care . The system is not gear to look at a person as a whole , to see how the pattern fit togeth ,  Dr. Steinman said .In the meantim , though , patient and famili can ask their physician for brown bag review , includ everi supplement , and discuss whether to continu or chang their regimen . Pharmacist , often underus as inform sourc , can help coordin medic , and some patient qualifi for medic review through Medicar .We spend an aw lot of money and effort tri to figur out when to start medic ,  Dr. Alexand said , and shockingli littl on when to stop.', 'The Center for Diseas Control and Prevent defend a recommend that sexual activ women refrain from drink alcohol if they are not use birth control after it spur a strong backlash , with mani women say they consid the suggest insult , sever and impract .Ann Schuchat , princip deputi director of the C.D.C. , said in an interview Friday , We werent as clear as we had hope to be.The C.D.C . report releas on Tuesday focus on the possibl that children may develop fetal alcohol spectrum disord , estim that 3.3 million women between the age of 15 and 44 who drink alcohol while not use birth control risk expos their infant to the disord .The report suggest that women who intend to get pregnant or could get pregnant should not drink alcohol , as about half of all pregnanc in the Unit State are unplan and most women do not know they are pregnant until four to six week into the pregnanc .But the idea that fertil women who are not use contracept should indefinit not drink alcohol wa not well receiv by mani women . Dr. Schuchat , howev , said the C.D.C. intent wa to explain the risk of drink befor a woman know she is pregnant and to show that the harm effect of alcohol on a develop babi were complet preventable  not to prescrib a lifestyl or suggest women plan their entir live around a hypothet baby.Wer realli all about empow women to make good choic and to give them the best inform we can so they can decid what they want to do themselv ,  Dr. Schuchat said .

Dashboard camera , rooftop camera and even one mount on a small airplan captur footag of the bright object in the night sky .The first meteor appear on Jan. 30 , at 6:16 p.m. Eastern Standard Time , and wa seen by more than 900 peopl across Virginia , New York and New Jersey , accord to the American Meteor Societi .Mike Grossman spot it from 1,500 feet in the air while pilot hi privat plane over the Hudson River in New York . He captur video use a camera he had previous mount to the tail of hi aircraft to record that night scenic flight .There no way you could miss it ,  he said . With your peripher vision , your immedi struck by it. He watch as the meteor blaze across the sky for about three second , then radio in to the La Guardia Airport radio tower to report what he saw . Upon review hi footag , Mr. Grossman said he wa pleasantli surpris that he had captur the firebal but said that the video doe not compar with the spectacl he saw from the cockpit .It total unexpect , one of those moment when you dont know how to process what your seeing.Alexand Salvador caught thi dashcam video of the same bright white object from Fall Church , Va. , while out food shop for hi famili .It came out of nowher ,  he said . The first thing I said wa Ooh a comet !  Then it quickli dawn on me that it couldnt have been a comet , it wa too close.Mr. Salvador said the sight wa unnerv at first , but that he wa happi to have caught it with hi camera .

One minut , scientist were fish Richard III gene from hi royal bone , and the next they were show off DNA retriev from 5,00-year-old Incan mummi .The idea that DNA could surviv for thousand of year  let alon be reassembl into an entir genom  seem littl short of miracul .Despit the field rapid advanc in recent year , though , ancient DNA is still hard to find and hard to make sens of . Potenti error lurk around everi corner . Even littl oversight can caus big headach .Andrea Manica , a geneticist at the Univers of Cambridg , appreci thi fact all too well . A head-turn studi by hi team turn out to have a fundament flaw that eras some of it most provoc conclus .In Octob , Dr. Manica and hi colleagu reconstruct the first ancient human genom ever found in Africa , retriev from the skeleton of a man who live in Ethiopia 4,500 year ago .Ancient DNA expert were delight , becaus the genom may provid clue about African histori that other kind of evid  broken potteri shard , for exampl , or scrap of ancient manuscript  can not .It an amaz , amaz , uniqu , special , incred , first-of-its-kind data set ,  David Reich , a geneticist at Harvard Medic School who wa not involv in the studi , said in an interview .After Dr. Manica and hi colleagu publish their result , Dr. Reich and Pontu Skoglund , anoth geneticist at Harvard , request the origin data . They want to use it in their own studi of ancient human popul .Dr. Reich and Dr. Skoglund reanalyz the find  but did not reach the same conclus .In the origin studi , Dr. Manica and hi colleagu sought to understand how the ancient Ethiopian man ( dub Mota , after the cave where hi bodi wa buri ) wa relat to other human . The research found mani uniqu mutat that link Mota to a group of Ethiopian who live near the cave today , known as the Ari .By contrast , the research found that Mota wa onli distantli relat to mani peopl elsewher in Africa . In fact , the analysi suggest that most live African share some DNA with European and Asian that were miss from Mota genom .To explain these intrigu result , Dr. Manica and hi colleagu test out differ histor scenario . In the best-support one , a group of peopl migrat from the Near East back to East Africa  a so-cal backflow  about 3,000 year ago . In subsequ gener , their DNA spread across Africa .But some of the implic of thi theori were surpris . For one thing , thi backflow seem to have rage like a flood , spread all the way across the contin in rel littl time .Those provoc implic drew wide attent in the media , includ The Time . Unfortun , Dr. Skoglund and Dr. Reich couldnt find ani trace of the migrat beyond East Africa .Onc Dr. Manica learn of the conundrum , he and hi colleagu retrac their step .They discov that they had neglect to take one small but essenti step in their analysi . It wa clear human error ,  said Dr. Manica in an interview . It just someth that should have been done that didnt get done.The DNA in a bone thousand of year old ha broken into littl fragment . After scientist retriev those fragment , they must fit the piec back togeth like a jigsaw puzzl .One way to do a jigsaw puzzl is to refer to the pictur on the box . Similarli , scientist work with ancient gene fragment refer to a standard refer genom to figur out what goe where . That requir softwar design to reassembl DNA fragment in as littl time as possibl .As it turn out , the data produc by the program use to map Mota DNA came in a format that had to be tweak befor the scientist use a second program to compar it with other genom . In the Mota studi , no one did the tweak .That littl oversight had a big impact . Dr. Manica and hi colleagu unknowingli ignor some spot in the genom where Mota DNA wa ident to that of Eurasian . As a result , Mota appear not to be as close relat to Eurasian as he realli wa .The mistak also creat the fals impress that mani African outsid of East Africa share a lot of gene with Eurasian , DNA not found in Mota genom .Dr. Manica and hi colleagu last week post a statement about the error , which wa first report in the journal Natur . They have ask Scienc , where their studi appear , to publish an erratum , and the journal is consid it .Still , Dr. Reich note , other part of the origin studi , such as the reconstruct sequenc of the Mota genom , stood up to scrutini . The Ari do appear to be close kin to Mota .What more , the Eurasian backflow did inde occur  but onli East African carri DNA from that event . At least the gener stori still stand ,  said Dr. Manica .The Mota genom will remain an import resourc for scientist studi human histori . Dr. Manica and hi colleagu , for exampl , are use it to studi how human expand from Africa into Europ and Asia more than 50,000 year ago .Dr. Manica and Dr. Reich agre that ancient DNA expert need to be will to share their analys to catch such error in the futur .It so scari to work with thi kind of data ,  said Dr. Reich . Im sure well make a mistak at some point , too.', 'The Channel Island , off the coast of Southern California , are a natur laboratori for a particularli ador experi in evolut .A uniqu speci call the island fox ha live there for sever thousand year , their bodi shrink over the gener until now each is smaller than a hous cat . Adult island fox weigh as littl as 2.35 pound .Now a team of scientist ha discov anoth way in which island fox are extraordinari : Genet , they are nearli ident to one anoth . In fact , a fox commun on one island ha set a record for the least genet variat in a sexual reproduc speci .Oliv A. Ryder , the director of genet at the San Diego Zoo Institut for Conserv Research , said the new research pose a biolog puzzl .It an axiom of evolutionari biolog that low level of genet variat put speci at risk of extinct . Yet the delic island fox are still race across meadow and bound up tree .How can the island fox get away with it ?  Dr. Ryder said .The new studi , publish on Thursday in Current Biolog , wa led by Robert K. Wayn , a geneticist at the Univers of California , Lo Angel . Dr. Wayn ha been studi the DNA of island fox sinc the earli 1990 , hope to understand their remark makeup .Theyr like dodo ,  Dr. Wayn said in an interview . They have no notion of human fear . You can just put them in your lap.Some scientist suspect that island fox are fearless becaus of a long relationship with human .Nativ American first settl the island about 13,000 year ago , and they may have brought along gray fox from the mainland . Previou studi indic that island fox share an ancestor with gray fox that live 9,200 year ago .It unlik the fox made the trip on their own ; the island are separ from the mainland by 12 to 70 mile of open ocean . Anoth clue point to human help : Nativ American paint fox on rock and gave them ceremoni burial . Fox may have had a spiritu import to them .Howev the anim arriv on the Channel Island , they adapt quickli . The oldest island fox fossil date back 7,000 year and show that they were small even then . The Great Shrink requir less than 2,200 year , it seem .Dr. Wayn ha focus on genet variat among the island fox . He and hi colleagu start off by examin a few genet marker , find strike similar among the anim . But the scientist couldnt be sure just how similar the fox were until technolog advanc made it possibl to sequenc their genom .There are six subspeci , each live on a separ Channel Island . In their new studi , Dr. Wayn sequenc the genom of one fox from each of five subspeci . On the sixth island , San Nicola , they sequenc two genom .Like other anim , island fox carri two copi of each gene , inherit one copi from each parent . In larg popul with a lot of genet variat , there can be mani version of a given gene . An anim may inherit two vari copi of a gene from it parent .But the scientist discov virtual no differ in the DNA the fox had inherit . We call it genet flatlin ,  Dr. Wayn said .While each subspeci ha veri littl divers , the fox on San Nicola are almost like ident twin , a record .Low genet variat can pose a seriou threat to surviv . When a new threat appear  a new diseas , for instanc  some individu may have the gene to resist it and other lack them . In a popul with low genet variat , none of the anim may have the right gene to surviv .Inbr popul also often share mutat that are bad for health , shorten life span or reduc the number of offspr . Dr. Wayn and hi colleagu found that island fox have mani more harm mutat than gray fox on the mainland .On the face of it , the island fox should have vanish long ago . But that hasnt happen to them in thousand of year ,  Dr. Wayn said . Theyr an except to the paradigm.Dr. Wayn specul that island fox might enjoy some sort of special protect . It possibl , for exampl , that as top predat on a small island , they didnt have to face the challeng that other inbr anim do . Or perhap the peopl who live on the island help them surviv .Or , while the gene of island fox may be almost entir ident , mayb they are activ in the anim in vari pattern . Experi earli in life can program gene to switch on and off , a phenomenon call epigenet .It might also be some combin of all of the abov ,  Dr. Wayn said .Other research suggest that island fox have been protect in more familiar way . Newli arriv fox could have rejuven the Channel Island gene pool with some fresh variat .Their studi ha not rule out occasion immigr reach the island ,  said Richard Frankham , a geneticist at Macquari Univers in Australia .But Dr. Wayn said hi new studi cast doubt on that possibl .Each subspeci of island fox is genet distinct , show no sign of newli introduc gene move from island to island . There no evid of gene flow ,  Dr. Wayn said .Understand the evolutionari histori of the island fox is import to ensur they have a futur . A rapid popul declin led to four subspeci of island fox be declar endang in 2004 .It like that sever caus help drive down their number .In recent decad , golden eagl have arriv on the island and begun kill off the fox , which have also face new diseas introduc by raccoon and other invas anim .Some research are concern that their genet similar could increas the risk . If we care about the persist of island fox and other small popul , we should be concern about low genet variat ,  said W. Chri Funk , a biologist at Colorado State Univers .Write in the journal Molecular Ecolog last month , Dr. Funk and hi colleagu suggest one way to help the fox : move anim among the island . If the subspeci mix gene by interbreed , they may be abl to increas their variat .Scientist have use thi procedur , known as genet rescu , to help other speci . In Florida , for exampl , the resid panther popul ha had a difficult time produc new cub . Research introduc panther from Texa , and their new gene have help the Florida panther popul grow .Base on hi new research , Dr. Wayn said he didnt think island fox need genet rescu , at least until scientist find strong evid that they are suffer becaus of low genet variat .I would realli hesit to move fox around ,  Dr. Wayn said . Each island is genet distinct . I would be loath to destroy that.', 'Sweden lead medic univers on Thursday dismiss a promin surgeon whom it had earlier clear of scientif misconduct charg relat to hi work in the field of regen medicin .Offici at the Karolinska Institut in Stockholm said that the surgeon , Paolo Macchiarini , a visit professor , will have until hi contract expir in Novemb to phase out hi research and that hi lab would be shut .Last year , Dr. Macchiarini , who had perform experiment transplant involv plastic windpip embed with stem cell , wa accus by sever colleagu of inaccur describ the outcom of the procedur in medic journal and greatli overst the effect of hi work .Two of the three patient he oper on in Stockholm die , and the third ha been hospit for more than three year .

Tore Nielsen , a dream neurosci research and director of the Dream and Nightmar Laboratori , at the Univers of Montreal , surmis that at the end of life , such a need becom more insist . Troubl dream erupt with excess energi . But posit dream can serv a similar purpos .The motiv and pressur for these dream is come from a place of fear and uncertainti ,  he said . The dreamer are liter help themselv out of a tough spot.In the week and day befor death , the dream of the patient in the studi tend to occur with greater frequenc , popul with the dead rather than the live . The research suggest that such phenomena might even have prognost valu .I wa an aggress physician , alway ask , I there more we can do ?   said Dr. Kerr , who is also the chief medic offic for Hospic Buffalo . There wa a patient who I thought need to be rehydr , and we could buy him some time. But , he said , a nurs , familiar with the patient dream , caution : You dont get it . He is see hi dead mother. He die two day later.Certainli , mani die patient can not commun . Or they recount typic dream detritu : a dwarf lift the refriger , neighbor bring a chicken and a monkey into the patient apart . And some patient , to their disappoint , do not rememb their dream .Dr. Kerr , who recent gave a talk at TEDxBuffalo about the research , said he wa simpli advoc that health care provid ask patient open-end question about dream , without fear of recrimin from famili and colleagu .Often when we sedat them , we are steril them from their own die process ,  he said . I have done it , and it feel horribl . Theyll say , You rob me  I wa with my wife.While the patient wa lie in bed , her mother by her side , she had a vision : She saw her mother best friend , Mari , who die of leukemia year ago , in her mother bedroom , play with the curtain . Mary hair wa long again . I had a feel she wa come to say , Your go to be O.K. I felt relief and happi and I wasnt afraid of it at all.  Jessica Stone , 13 , who had Ewing sarcoma , a type of bone cancer , a few month befor she die .Mani in hospic suffer from delirium , which can affect up to 85 percent of hospit patient at the end of life . In a deliri state , brought on by fever , brain metastas or end-stag chang in bodi chemistri , circadian rhythm are sever disord , so the patient may not know whether he is awak or dream . Cognit is alter .Those who care for the termin ill are inclin to see end-of-lif dream as manifest of delirium . But the Hospic Buffalo research say that while some studi patient slip in and out of delirium , their end-of-lif dream were not , by definit , the product of such a state . Deliri patient gener can not engag with other or give a coher , organ narr . The hallucin they are abl to describ may be traumat , not comfort .Yet the question remain of what to make of these patients claim of dream while awak ,  or have visions  and the not-uncommon phenomena of see deceas rel or friend hover on the ceil or in corner .Donna Brennan , a longtim nurs with Hospic Buffalo , recal chat on the couch with a 92-year-old patient with congest heart failur . Suddenli , the patient look over at the door and call out , Just a minut , Im speak with the nurse.Told that no one wa there , the patient smile , say it wa Aunt Janiec ( her dead sister ) and pat a couch cushion , show the visitor where to sit . Then the patient cheer turn back to Mrs. Brennan and finish her convers .In her note , Mrs. Brennan describ the episod as a hallucin ,  a red flag for delirium . When the episod wa recount to Dr. Kerr and Ann Bana , a Hospic Buffalo neurologist and palli care physician , they prefer the term vision.I there mean to the vision or is it disorgan ?  Dr. Bana ask . If there is mean , doe that need to be explor ? Doe it bring comfort or is it distress ? We have a respons to ask that next question . It can be cathart , and patient often need to share . And if we dont ask , look what we may miss.Dr. William Breitbart , chairman of the psychiatri depart at Memori Sloan Ketter Cancer Center , who ha written about delirium and palli care , said that a team respons must also consid bedsid caregiv : These dream or vision can be interpret by famili member as comfort , link them to the legaci of their ancestri .But if peopl dont believ that , they can be distress . Mi mother is hallucin and see dead peopl . Do someth about it !  Dr. Breitbart train staff to respect the families belief and help them understand the complex of delirium .Some dream episod occur dure what is known as mixed-st sleep  when the boundari between wake and sleep becom fragment , said Dr. Carlo H. Schenck , a psychiatrist and sleep expert at the Univers of Minnesota Medic School . Jessica Stone , the teenag with Ewing sarcoma , spoke movingli about a dream of her dead dog , Shadow . When she awok , she said , she saw hi long , dark shape alongsid her bed .Dr. Bana , the neurologist , favor the phrase end-of-lif experi . I tri to normal it for the famili , becaus how they perceiv it can push them away from that bedsid or bring them closer ,  she said .The patient had never realli talk about the war . But in hi final dream , the stori emerg . In the first , the bloodi die were everywher . On Omaha Beach , at Normandi . In the wave . He wa a 17-year-old gunner on a rescu boat , tri frantic to bring them back to the U.S. . Texa . There is noth but death and dead soldier all around me ,  he said . In anoth , a dead soldier told him , They are go to come get you next week. Final , he dream of get hi discharg paper , which he describ as comforting. He die in hi sleep two day later .  John , 88 , who had lymphoma .Not all end-of-lif dream sooth the die . Research found that about 20 percent were upset . Often , those who had suffer trauma might revisit it in their die dream . Some can resolv those experi . Some can not .When should doctor interven with antipsychot or anti-anxieti medic , to best allow the patient a peac death ? For the Hospic Buffalo physician , the decis is made with a team assess that includ input from famili member .Dr. Kerr said : Children will see their parent in an alter state and think theyr suffer and fight their die . But if you say : She talk about dead peopl , and that normal . Ill bet you can learn a lot about her and your famili ,  you may see the rel calm down and take notes.Without receiv suffici inform from the famili , a team may not know how to read the patient agit . One patient seem torment by nightmar . The Hospic Buffalo team interview famili member , who reluctantli disclos that the woman had been sexual abus as a girl . The famili wa horrifi that she wa reliv these memori in her die day .Arm with thi inform , the team chose to administ anti-anxieti medic , rather than just antipsychot . The woman relax and wa abl to have a power exchang with a priest . She die dure a quiet sleep , sever day later .Thi fall , Mrs. Brennan , the nurs , would check in on a patient with end-stag lung cancer who wa a former polic offic . He told her that he had done bad stuff on the job . He said he had cheat on hi wife and wa estrang from hi children . Hi dream are never peac , Mrs. Brennan said . He get stab , shot or cant breath . He apolog to hi wife , and she isnt respond , or she remind him that he broke her heart . He a tortur soul.Some palli care provid maintain that such dream are the core of a spiritu experi and should not be tamper with . Dr. Quill , who call peopl with such view hospic romant ,  disagre .We should be open the door with our question , but not forc patient through it ,  Dr. Quill said . Our job is wit , explor and lessen their loneli . If it benign and rich with content , let it go . But if it bring up seriou old wound , get real help  a psychologist , a chaplain  becaus in thi area , we physician dont know what wer do . In the first dream , a black spider with small eye came close to her face . Then it turn into a larg black truck with a red flatb , bear down on her . Terrifi , she forc herself awak . In anoth dream , she had to pass through her laundri room to get to the kitchen . She glanc down and saw about 50 black spider crawl on the floor . She wa so scare ! But when she look closer , she saw they were ladybug . She felt so happi ! Ladybug are nice and I knew they werent go to hurt me ,  she recount later . So I made my way to the kitchen. Rosemari Shaffer , 78 , two month befor she die of colon cancer .The Hospic Buffalo research have found that these dream offer comfort not onli for the die , but for their mourner .Kathleen Hutton hold fast to the end-of-lif dream journal fastidi kept by her sister , Mrs. Shaffer , a former elementari schoolteach and princip . Rosemari Shaffer wrote about spider and truck , and then the ladybug . In one dream , she saw flower at a funer home , which remind her of those her daughter paint on handmad scarv . She felt love and joy .I wa glad she could talk about dream with the hospic peopl ,  Ms. Hutton said . She knew it wa her subconsci work through what she wa feel . She wa much more at peace.Know that ha made her own grief more manag , said Ms. Hutton , who tear up as she clasp the journal dure a visit at the hospice famili loung .Sever month ago , Mrs. Brennan , the nurs , sat with a distraught husband , whose wife had pancreat cancer that had spread to the liver . She had been report dream about work , God and familiar peopl who had die . The patient thought that she would be welcom in heaven , she said . That God told her she had been a good wife and mother .Her husband wa angri at God ,  Mrs. Brennan said . I said : But Ann is not . Her dream arent scari to her at all . They are all about validation.He just put hi head down and wept.', 'Escal homicid rate in Mexico are affect the country averag life expect .Accord to research publish in the journal Health Affair , the life expect for Mexican men age 15 to 50 fell by 0.6 percent from 2005 to 2010 .In most countri , homicid do commonli occur , particularli among young peopl ,  said Hiram Beltrn-Snchez , a professor of public health at the Univers of California , Lo Angel , and the lead author of the studi . What is unusu , though , is for homicid to have such a larg impact at the nation level.In 2005 , Mexico murder rate wa 9.5 per 100,000 peopl , but by 2010 , that figur had more than doubl , to 22 per 100,000 . That shift coincid with the begin of a new nation secur strategi in 2006 , which aim to dismantl crimin organ , Dr. Beltrn-Snchez said .We suspect that the rise in homicid ha to do with those polici , which we hope will be discontinued.As in most countri around the world , improv in health care , live standard and nutrit had increas life expect in Mexico , which rose by four to five year per decad from 1940 to 2000 . Had that pattern held , Mexican men , whose life expect at birth wa about 72 year in 2000 , should have averag 76 or 77 year in 2010 .Instead , Dr. Beltrn-Snchez and hi colleagu found that life expect had held steadi over that time . For women dure the same period , life expect increas by less than a year  from about 77 to 78 year  rather than the 5.5 year seen in past decad .Accord to Dr. Beltrn-Snchez analysi , life expect seem to be on the rise from 2000 to 2005 , but from 2005 to 2010 , mani state , especi those at the center of the drug war , had a drastic revers .The averag life expect for men in the state of Chihuahua , Sinaloa and Durango , for exampl , fell by three year over those five year . Chihuahua averag more than 20 death per 1,000 male under age 75 .The life expect among women in those state wa also affect , fall by three to six month .Becaus of the surplu of missing-person report in Mexico , Dr. Beltrn-Snchez and hi colleagu consid their result a conserv estim of homicide true effect on life expect .We dont know if miss individu are alreadi dead or still aliv ,  Dr. Beltrn-Snchez said . So what wer find , although dramat , is not as bad as it could actual be.Dr. Beltrn-Snchez suspect that even sharper trend are play out in other nation where homicid rate have recent shot up , includ El Salvador and Hondura .Our next step is to tri to get our hand on data from other Central American countri ,  he said . Get reliabl data that actual reflect what go on is alway the issue.', 'The latest exhibit at the Nation Museum of Mathemat in Manhattan wa suppos to have been put on display last fall , except it wa not quit work .It call Beaver Run , but the way thing were go , Beaver Derail would have been more accur .We could have open it , and it would have been unsatisfactori ,  said Cindi Lawrenc , the execut director of the museum , popularli known as MoMath .So the museum decid to gnaw at the problem a while longer .The concept is straightforward . Two mechan beaver move along wind track , which visitor can reconfigur use a panel of 24 knob . Each twist of a knob caus a correspond turntabl to pivot 90 degre , and that switch the connect between segment of track .One of the mathemat truism underli Beaver Run is that never shall the two beaver meet .That is a fact ,  said Glen Whitney , MoMath founder and presid . No matter how I turn thi sequenc of knob  and it seem as though I have complet power to reconfigur these track , make the beaver go wherev I want them to  nevertheless , I will never be abl to make the beaver meet each other.That truism is subject to a few condit . For one , the two beaver can not be place on the track so they just run into each other . Anoth restrict is that one can not turn a turntabl while a beaver is on it , thu depriv visitor the glee of send the anim careen off the track across the miniatur swamp and forest landscap . Final , the two beaver have to trundl at the same speed , in synchroni from turntabl to turntabl .The import thing that you need to know is that when Beaver 1 is pass a junction , Beaver 2 is pass some other junction somewher els on the board , simultan ,  Mr. Whitney said .That wa the tricki part . The intern locomot of the beaver come from ident electr motor from model railroad train , but they did not run at exactli the same speed .First , the exhibit maker attempt a crude fix . Sensor next to the track note the posit of the beaver , and when one got too far ahead , the softwar cut off power to that beaver , bring it to a jolt stop for a moment until the other caught up .That , said Geva Patz , a museum volunt who wa final abl to make Beaver Run run , doesnt fit veri well with the notion of busi beaver  knock off for a tea break everi 20 seconds.It wa also not a veri good solut . The jerki stop and start also sometim partli derail the beaver , sever the electr connect .The museum staff knew the program and tinker expertis of Mr. Patz , a founder of Android Alpha , an option trade financi firm , and ask him to take a look .It becam clear , after lot of test , we need someth more sophist ,  Mr. Patz said .Mr. Patz fix wa to add brain to the beaver  small comput chip with Wi-Fi modul . Now , the exhibit send instruct to the beaver to speed up and slow down , almost impercept , to stay synchron , and they derail less often .On Saturday , the exhibit wa unveil for all museum visitor to play with .The exhibit grew out of brainstorm about Truchet tile , name after Sbastien Truchet , a French Dominican priest who describ them in 1704 . The tile are decor with simpl pattern that are not rotat symmetr .The Beaver Run exhibit is base on Truchet tile popular in 1987 by Cyril Stanley Smith , a scientist at Massachusett Institut of Technolog . On each tile , two quarter-circl connect midpoint of adjac side .Timothi Nissen , the museum chief design , thought of turn the quarter-circl into train track . I thought , Well , what if we had train move on a Truchet tile ?  he said . Wouldnt kid love that ? And you could rearrang them remot . And so I thought that would be sort of a cool idea.In the exhibit , the tile can be rotat to produc 18 small circl . It is also possibl to form one larg loop .Mr. Whitney , also a model train enthusiast , like the idea , and he rememb the mathemat proof that would allow two train to run on the track and never crash .With some effort , Ms. Lawrenc persuad Mr. Nissen and Mr. Whitney to use beaver . I had a veri strong sens that train might appeal more to boy than girl ,  she said . We thought littl beaver , littl anim , are more univers appealing.That is all part of the museum mission to convey the magic of math to everyon . Sinc the museum open in 2012 , 465,000 visitor have pass through it door on East 26th Street . We want to get peopl curiou about whi the beaver are not meet and hope get a glimps into the reason whi mathematician are interest in do proof and the power those proof provid ,  Mr. Whitney said .Those intrigu by Truchet tile can find more at the museum .If you ventur into one of our bathroom and look at one of the tile wall , you will see anoth Truchet tile ,  Ms. Lawrenc said . If you look realli care , you will see a hidden message.', 'HONOLULU  A thousand mile south of Hawaii , the air at 45,000 feet abov the equatori Pacif wa a shimmer gumbo of thick storm cloud and ici cirru haze , all cook up by the overh water below .In a Gulfstream jet more accustom to hunt hurrican in the Atlant , research with the Nation Ocean and Atmospher Administr were cruis thi desol stretch of tropic ocean where the northern and southern trade wind meet . It an area that becalm sailor have long call the doldrum , but thi year it is anyth but quiet .Thi is the heart of the strongest El Nio in a gener , one that is pump moistur and energi into the atmospher and , as a result , roil weather worldwid .The plane , with 11 peopl aboard includ a journalist , made it way Friday on a long westward tack , steer clear of the worst of the disturb air to the south . Everi 10 minut , on a countdown from Mike Holm , one of two flight director , technician in the rear releas an instrument packag out through a narrow tube in the floor . Slow by a small parachut , the devic , call dropsond , fell toward the water , transmit wind speed and direct , humid and other atmospher data back to the plane continu on the way down .The inform , pars by scientist and fed into weather model , may improv forecast of El Nio effect on weather by help research better understand what happen here , at the start point .One of the most import question is to resolv how well our current weather and climat model do in repres the tropic atmosphere respons to an El Nio ,  said Randal Dole , a senior scientist at NOAA Earth System Research Laboratori and one of the lead research on the project . It the first link in the chain.An El Nio form about everi two to seven year , when the surfac wind that typic blow from east to west slacken . As a result , warm water that normal pool along the Equat in the western Pacif pile up toward the east instead . Becaus of thi shift , the expans of water  which in thi El Nio ha made the central and eastern Pacif as much as 5 degre Fahrenheit hotter than usual  act as a heat engin , affect the jet stream that blow at high altitud .That , in turn , can bring more winter rain to the lower third of the Unit State and dri condit to southern Africa , among El Nio mani possibl effect .Aid by vast process power and better data , scientist have improv the abil of their model to predict when an El Nio will occur and how strong it will be . As earli as last June , the consensu among forecast use model develop by NOAA , as well as other American and foreign agenc and academ institut , wa that a strong El Nio would develop later in the year , and it did .But scientist have been less success at forecast an El Nio effect on weather . Thi year , for instanc , most model have been less certain about what it will mean for parch California . So far , much of the state ha receiv higher than usual precipit , but it is still unclear whether Southern California , especi , will be delug as much as it wa dure the last strong El Nio , in 1997-98 .Anthoni Barnston , the chief forecast at the Intern Research Institut for Climat and Societi at Columbia Univers , who ha studi the accuraci of El Nio model , said that so-cal dynam model , which simul the physic of the real world , have recent done a better job in predict whether an El Nio will occur than statist model , which reli on comparison of histor data .With a dynam model , Dr. Barnston said , data repres current condit is fed into the model , and off it goe . You plug it in and you crank it forward in time ,  he said . Thi can be done dozen of time  or as often as money will allow  tweak the data slightli each time and averag the outcom .With ani model , good data is crucial . El Nio model have been help by the develop of satellit and network of buoy that can measur sea-surfac temperatur and other ocean characterist .When it come to forecast El Nio weather effect , howev , good data can be harder to come by . That where the NOAA research project aim to help , by studi a key process in the El Nio-weath connect : deep tropic convect .The cloud that the NOAA jet cruis past on Friday were a result of thi process , in which air over the warm El Nio water pick up heat and moistur and rise ten of thousand of feet . When the air reach high altitud  about the flight level of the Gulfstream  the moistur condens into droplet , releas energi in the form of heat and creat wind that flow outward .Scientist know that the energi releas can induc a kind of rippl in a jet stream , a wave that as it travel along can affect weather in dispar region around the world . And they know that the wind that are gener can add a kick to a jet stream , strengthen it . That a major reason California and much of the southern Unit State tend to be wetter in an El Nio ; the wind from convect strengthen the jet stream enough that it reach California and beyond .But to studi convect dure an El Nio , data must be collect from the atmospher as well as the sea surfac . That a daunt task , becaus the convect occur in one of the most remot area of the planet . As a result , there ha been littl actual data on convect dure El Nio event , Dr. Dole said , and most model , includ NOAA own , have had to make what amount to educ guess about the detail of the process .Our strong suspicion is that our model have major error in reproduc some of these respons ,  he said . The onli way we can tell is by go out and do observations.When forecast last year began to predict a strong El Nio , the NOAA scientist saw an opportun and start make plan for a rapid-respons program of research .Dr. Dole estim that it would normal take two or three year to put togeth a program they assembl in about six month .In a way , he said , they were help by the develop El Nio , which suppress hurrican activ in the Atlant last fall . The Gulfstream flew fewer mission and the avail flight hour , as well as extra dropsond , were transfer to the project .In addit to the jet  which is also equip with Doppler radar to studi wind  the program is launch other sond , from a ship and a small atol near the Equat . A larg remot pilot aircraft from NASA , the Global Hawk , ha also been enlist to studi the Pacif between Hawaii and the mainland .The Gulfstream flight Friday wa the researchers fourth so far , out of nearli two dozen plan over the next month . The day began at Honolulu Intern Airport five hour befor the 11:30 a.m. takeoff when Ryan Spackman , the other lead investig , and NOAA colleagu sat down for a weather brief with Dr. Dole and other scientist at the agency offic in Boulder , Colo .The origin plan wa to fli due south from Honolulu and around an area of convect  a cell in meteorolog term  near the Equat . But when the plane three pilot arriv for their brief sever hour later , the plan wa chang out of safeti concern . There wa a risk they would have no way to get back from the south side of the convect area without go through a storm , and the Gulfstream , unlik NOAA other hurricane-hunt plane , can not do that .In the end , scientist and aviat agre they would fli a long leg along the north fring of the convect area .The plan call for 30 dropsond , and the crew releas a few dure the long flight down to the convect zone and then pick up the pace as the plane head west .A brief whoosh nois wa the onli indic that a sond had been releas . The cylindr tube , which weigh about a pound , are simpli suck out of the plane by the differ in pressur between the cabin and the outsid air , and quickli sink when they hit the water about 15 minut later .Data start stream in almost immedi onc a dropsond leav the plane , and is display in real time on a few of the sever comput screen in the cabin , includ the one man by Richard Hen , the other flight director . Mr. Hen , who like Mr. Holm is a meteorologist , make sure the data is clean  with hi practic eye , he can quickli tell if a sensor ha malfunct or the sond ha otherwis provid unus data  befor send it off in sever form , includ a condens format that can be immedi fed into model around the world .Elsewher in the cabin , crew member made sure all the plane electron were run properli and monitor the Doppler radar . Mr. Holm , Dr. Spackman and the aircraft command , Ron Moyer , talk from time to time about cours chang design to get closer to the convect to obtain better data .After two and a half hour of fli west , it wa time to turn to the northeast and head back to Honolulu , still three hour away . The pace of work slow again , with onli a few dropsond left to releas .Mr. Hen and Dr. Spackman took time to look over some of the dropsond data . They saw wind come out of the top of the convect cell and blow toward the northwest . Earth rotat , Dr. Spackman said , would make that wind curv to the east , where it would no doubt join up with the Pacif jet stream that wa affect the West Coast .Dr. Spackman seem pleas despit the chang in plan . We did a lot of good scienc today ,  he said .', 'TO THE EDITOR :Re A Hole in Health Care ( Jan. 26 ) : I am a senior faculti physician at Oregon Health and Scienc Univers and know veri , veri well the geriatrician describ in your articl .

You can find the result in scienc fiction novel ( The Day of the Triffids ) , Broadway play ( Littl Shop of Horrors ) and in recent research that conclud that the Venu flytrap can count .Not out loud , of cours . And no one is claim that the plant are awar that they are count . But even so , thi is the first time someon ha demonstr count in a plant , accord to the research who led the experi , Rainer Hedrich at the Univers of Wrzburg , in Germani .Dr. Hedrich , Jennif Bhm and Snke Scherzer , all at Wrzburg , and a team of other scientist report their research in Current Biolog .Venu flytrap are carnivor . They live in poor soil and pull need nutrient from the insect they trap and dissolv . Their trap is a pair of leav that act as jaw and stomach .When an insect land and bump into trigger hair on the surfac of these leav , the trap close . As digest enzym seep into the trap , it becom what Dr. Hedrich call a green stomach ,  and the prey is gradual turn into a nourish soup .Scientist knew that an insect had to bump the trigger hair more than onc to caus the trap to shut , presum to avoid wast energi by respond to random raindrop and windblown debri .In the recent experi , research studi how the plant wa respond to movement of the trigger hair , and determin that it wa count electr puls from them .Plant dont have a nervou system to transmit these puls as anim do , but a spike in electr produc by biochem chang can travel on the surfac of cell .The research flick the trigger hair while they record electr activ in the plant . The motor cell that close the leafi jaw on prey act onli when they receiv two signal within about 20 second . That meant that the cell somehow rememb the first signal for a short time . After 20 second , thi first electr puls wa forgotten , essenti reset the process .But close the trap on an insect is onli Step 1 . The Venu flytrap must also dissolv it prey . Two flick of a trigger hair were not enough to kick off that mechan . More than three flick of a trigger hair were need to signal the cell that produc digest enzym to begin that process .In natur , the trigger hair are activ time and again as the trap prey struggl . That frenzi give the plant a way to judg the amount of digest enzym need . Dr. Hedrich and colleagu found that more electr signal from the trigger hair translat proport into more enzym for the green stomach .Dr. David Clapham at Harvard , who studi the biochemistri of how anim cell gener electr signal as a way to transmit signal in their nervou system , said he wa intrigu by what seem to be thi just-in-time system of provid digest juic . The flytrap expend energi onli to produc enzym when they are need and onli in the amount need , an effici mechan for a plant live in a poor environ .The process is slow compar with what occur in anim , he said , but plant have a lot more time to react.Dr. Hedrich said that electr signal were produc by biochem chang and that thi process evolv veri earli in the histori of life . A singl cell can be electr excit ,  he said .Ask about primit anim , like the worm C. elegan , studi in mani laboratori around the world by mani , mani scientist , he joke , I think the Venu flytrap is much smarter than C. elegan ,  quickli ad with a laugh , Dont quot me on that.', 'Mayb you have seen televis ad star the beefi , affabl comedian and actor known as Larri the Cabl Guy .In hi sleeveless shirt and gim me cap , he drive a monster truck or streak along on a jet ski , paus to chomp on a turkey drumstick or a barbecu rib , all the while proclaim hi love for America and for Prilosec OTC to fight frequent heartburn.Th caution that the drug should be taken for no more than 14 day , and not more often than everi four month , appear briefli on-screen . If you blink or go fetch your glass , youll miss it .Todd Semla ha notic the ad , too , and he not a fan . I dont see Larri the Cabl Guy say , If you take thi drug often , your kidney may be affect or you could break a hip ,  said Dr. Semla , a pharmacist at the Feinberg School of Medicin at Northwestern Univers , and past presid of the American Geriatr Societi .Sinc their introduct in 1990 , the drug collect known as proton pump inhibitor ( common brand name : Nexium , Prevacid , Prilosec ) have becom among the most frequent prescrib in the countri ; as the Cabl Guy point out , they are also avail over the counter . They suppress stomach acid more effect than a previou class of drug call H2 blocker ( Zantac , Tagamet , Pepcid ) .They have also given user reason to be wari . In recent year , score of studi have report associ between prescript P.P.I . use and an array of health problem , includ bone fractur , low magnesium level , kidney injuri and possibl cardiovascular drug interact .They are also link to infect , like the stubborn Clostridium difficil and pneumonia . Reduc the acid of the stomach , research believ , allow bacteria to thrive and then spread to other organ like the lung and intestin .The latest find , publish in JAMA Intern Medicin , point to increas risk of chronic kidney diseas among user , which is particularli worrisom .You can treat and hope cure infect ,  said Dr. Adam Schoenfeld , an intern medicin resid at the Univers of California , San Francisco , and an author of an accompani editori on the drugs advers effect . Fractur can heal , though they can be catastroph event for older peopl . But chronic kidney diseas doesnt go away.The new studi , by a John Hopkin team , compil year of data from two sourc : a commun sampl of 10,482 adult in four commun in North Carolina , Mississippi , Minnesota and Maryland ( averag age : 63 ) and a cohort of nearli 250,000 patient in a rural Pennsylvania health care system . Those who took prescript proton pump inhibitor were 20 percent to 50 percent more like to develop chronic kidney diseas than nonus , said the senior author , Dr. Morgan Gram , a nephrologist and epidemiologist at John Hopkin .Like the rest of these drug studi , thi one demonstr an associ , not a direct caus . But in the Pennsylvania sampl , the research document a dose effect : The risk of chronic kidney diseas rose 15 percent among those take the drug onc a day , but 46 percent in those take it twice daili , compar with nonus . That lead us to believ there a causal effect ,  Dr. Gram said .Rel risk statist sometim seem to exagger the danger of a drug or an ill , if they were low to begin with . But kidney diseas is quit common , particularli among older adult ,  Dr. Gram point out . And the P.P.I.-us popul is vast , she ad . When you have 15 million peopl use these drug , even rel rare advers effect can affect a lot of people.Older peopl should probabl pay special heed . They are more like to have reflux , Dr. Semla said , in part becaus the muscl that prevent stomach acid from rise into the esophagu weaken with age . Older adult are therefor more like to take these drug , and also more vulner to the diseas and disord associ with them , especi with long-term use .All of thi led an American Geriatr Societi panel last year to add proton pump inhibitor to the list call the Beer Criteria for Potenti Inappropri Medic Use in Older Adult , cite the risk of bone loss and fractur and C. diff infect .The Food and Drug Administr ha also issu sever safeti announc about these drugs associ with C. diff , fractur risk and low magnesium , link to kidney diseas and other ailment .So youd think use of proton pump inhibitor would be declin . It not .Despit thi inform , those drug are extrem overprescrib ,  Dr. Schoenfeld said .From 1999 to 2002 , 9 percent of peopl age 55 to 64 report use a prescript gastric reflux drug ( includ non-P.P.I. ) in the previou 30 day , the Center for Diseas Control and Prevent ha report .Ten year later , the proport had risen to 16 percent . Among prescript medic , onli cardiac and cholesterol drug were more commonli use by adult age 55 to 64 .Proton pump inhibitor can be crucial medic , doctor hasten to point out , for those with peptic ulcer or for intens care patient , among other . Theyr also the most effect option for sever reflux . But whether over the counter or prescrib ( prescript can involv higher dose ) , they are usual recommend for short-term use .Yet there are definit older peopl whov been on these for 10 or 20 year ,  Dr. Schoenfeld said . Perhap the medic wa prescrib dure a hospit stay , then never discontinu . Or a patient took a nonprescript version for a bout of indigest , felt better and therefor kept take it , though the initi problem may have long ago disappear . Doctor , too , often fail to question extend use , Dr. Schoenfeld said .Regularli review all medic , prescript and over the counter , at offic visit might help reduc thi overus . Dr. Schoenfeld recommend taper off a proton pump inhibitor to see if it still need , or switch to one of the less potent H2 blocker , which dont appear to entail the same risk .Better yet , nonpharmacolog approach can often reduc heartburn and other reflux-rel problem . Lose weight help ; so doe limit certain medic , like aspirin . Dr. Semla suggest rais the head of your bed so stomach acid ha a harder time climb .Moreov , if peopl eat a lot of fatti , greasi food or drink a lot of alcohol or caffein , those are all trigger for heartburn ,  Dr. Schoenfeld said . It probabl also help  peopl are go to hate me  to cut back on chocol .With time or with dietari chang ,  he said , a lot of these symptom would go away on their own.Listen up , Cabl Guy .', 'The San Diego Archaeolog Center hold a pair of extraordinari skeleton . Date back about 9,500 year , they are among the oldest human remain ever found in the America .A number of scientist would love to studi the bone , use power new techniqu to extract ani surviv DNA .These skeleton of such antiqu are so import for help us understand what happen in the past in North America ,  said Brian Kemp , a molecular anthropologist at Washington State Univers .But for year , the remain have been out of reach , the subject of a legal struggl that pit three Univers of California scientist against their own administr and the Kumeyaay , a group of Nativ American tribe .The skeleton were found in San Diego La Jolla commun in 1976 by an archaeolog class dig on land own by the Univers of California , San Diego . In 2006 , a group of tribe laid claim to the skeleton , and the univers later agre to transfer custodi . To block the transfer , the scientist went to court .After lose in lower court , the scientist in Novemb ask the Unit State Suprem Court to becom involv . Thi week , the court declin . That decis swept away the last obstacl to the transfer .It hard to describ how bad I feel ,  said Robert L. Betting , one of the plaintiff in the case and a professor at the Univers of California , Davi . To have them slip through our finger thi way is a tremend loss for science.Steven Banega , spokesman for the Kumeyaay Cultur Repatri Committe , which claim the skeleton , said the tribe would meet to decid what to do with the remain . He did not rule out that scientist could studi them . These thing we need to discuss ,  he said . We want to be the one who tell our own story.At the time the skeleton were found , archaeologist were rel free to do with Nativ American remain as they saw fit . That chang with the passag of the Nativ American Grave Protect and Repatri Act of 1990 . The law wa a respons to some ugli chapter in the histori of research on Nativ American . Grave robber had plunder skeleton and sacr object , some of which were stockpil in museum .The act establish a legal procedur by which Nativ American could claim cultur object and human remain kept in museum or found on public land . More than 1.4 million object and remain of 50,000 peopl have been transfer under the act , but some case have spark conflict .In 1996 , for exampl , hiker stumbl across an 8,500-year-old skeleton in Kennewick , Wash . Nativ American tribe claim the skeleton , intend to reburi it . But scientist challeng their claim , and after eight year of legal battl , they won the opportun to studi the remain . Most recent , geneticist retriev enough DNA from the Kennewick Man bone to reconstruct hi entir genom .Last year , the scientist report that he wa close relat to live Nativ American . That find strongli weigh against earlier claim that Kennewick Man might be relat to Polynesian or even European .Ancient skeleton like Kennewick Man and the La Jolla remain can offer clue to how human spread across the America . Research gener agre that peopl move from Asia over the Bere Land Bridg roughli 15,000 year ago .How they spread from there is still the subject of fierc debat . Did they move down through the center of North America ? Did their rout hug the coast ? The La Jolla remain , excav from a cliff overlook the Pacif , could offer some clariti .The Kumeyaay Cultur Repatri Committe , repres 12 band of Nativ American in Southern California , file a claim for the La Jolla remain in 2006 .To determin what connect the remain might have to it peopl , the committe ask Arion May , a San Diego State anthropologist who had work on Kumeyaay skeleton , to conduct an examin , on the condit that she not destroy ani of the materi . It wa a great honor ,  Dr. May said .Dr. May found clue about what the two peopl had been like in life . One wa a man who die in hi mid- to late 20 . He had a strong right arm that he may have built up through the use of a spear thrower . The other , a woman in her late 30 or earli 40 , had teeth that show sign of have been worn down by strip fiber for make basket .She use her teeth as tool ,  Dr. May said .The Univers of California , for it part , appoint a committe of professor to evalu the tribes claim . In 2008 , they conclud that the skeleton were cultur unidentifiable. The grave contain no object that might have establish a cultur link , and the committe found no compel evid that these were ancient rel of the Kumeyaay peopl .Even so , Dr. Betting , a member of the committe , said in an interview that he grew concern that the univers would rush a transfer of the skeleton , and that the Kumeyaay would deni access .So in 2010 , he ask the univers for permiss to studi the remain . So did Margaret J. Schoening , an anthropologist at the Univers of California , San Diego , and Tim D. White of the Univers of California , Berkeley . Dr. Schoening wa deni , and Dr. Betting and Dr. White say they never receiv a respons .Instead , the Univers of California announc that in 2011 , the skeleton would be given to the La Posta Band , one of the Kumeyaay band . Dr. Betting , Dr. Schoening and Dr. White su to stop the transfer , argu that the univers had not made an adequ find about the skeleton .Dr. Kemp of Washington State , who file an amicu brief on behalf of the scientist , said the univers had fail to meet the requir of the repatri act . The law hasnt been follow ,  he said .But the court argument didnt directli address the university action or the scientif import of the skeleton . The Univers of California argu that the Kumeyaay band had to be join in the suit . Becaus the band had tribal immun , the univers argu , the scientist couldnt sue them .A district court agre and dismiss the suit . In 2014 , the Unit State Court of Appeal for the Ninth Circuit also rule against the scientist .In Novemb , the scientist petit the Suprem Court to send the case back to the circuit court to consid whether tribal immun can be invok in claim aris under the repatri act . The court reject the petit with no explan .It a tragedi and a disgrac  a tragedi for scienc , and a disgrac for the court ,  said Jame McMani , a lawyer for the plaintiff .Mr. McMani said the decis could leav research at a disadvantag becaus tribe will be abl to claim immun in disput over remain .The Suprem Court denial mark the end of the road for the scientist . The task now , said Dorothi Alther , the lawyer for the Kumeyaay , is to contact the univers and see what the next step are for repatriation.Kate Moser , a spokeswoman for the Univers of California , said by email , We believ the univers process ha achiev a decis that is in accord with both the law and our commit to the respect handl of human remain and associ artifacts.Dr. May said she hope that scientist and Nativ American would find more construct way to resolv such conflict . When you end up in the court , thing get volatil and the convers get lost ,  she said . Onli by have mutual respect will we have a posit situat in the future.While some tribe have reject ancient DNA studi , other have decid to go forward with them . Mr. Banega wouldnt rule out that possibl for the La Jolla remain onc they come into Kumeyaay custodi . That not off the tabl ,  he said . I wouldnt want anyon to think wer close off.', 'We all know bird in North America fli south for the winter and revisit us come spring , but have you ever wonder what their journey look like onc they leav our backyard ?Ornithologist from Cornel Univers develop thi migrat map to show a year worth of travel for more than a hundr bird speci across the Western Hemispher . Each dot repres a differ avian group as it fli thousand of mile to breed and feast . To creat the map , the research use data from more than a million observ made by amateur bird watcher through eBird , a citizen scienc project .Thi is the first comprehens pictur of where these bird are move across the entir year ,  said Frank La Sort , an ornithologist at Cornel and one of the map creator . It would have cost million of dollar to gather the inform need to reconstruct the trajectori with tradit track method , he said . Even if we track hundr and hundr of bird , we would not get thi level of detail.Dr. La Sort said that through their analysi , first publish last week in a biolog research journal , he and hi colleagu attempt to address what they consid the big question in migrat ecology : What migrat strategi do bird use to journey across the Western Hemispher ?They found three gener type of trajectori , includ clockwis movement , counterclockwis movement , and a doubl back along the same path .Bird that fli over the eastern portion of North America tend to follow rout that make larg clockwis loop . In autumn they travel south through the Atlant into the Caribbean and South America , and then in spring they loop back north through the Gulf of Mexicoand via a rout that is further inland than their previou one . Thi path enabl speci like the American Golden-Plov and Blackpol Warbler to take advantag of strong wind that help propel them in their desir direct .Flock that travel over the western portion of the contin , like the Hermit Warbler and the Duski Flycatch , do not make dramat loop like their eastern counterpart . Instead they tend to follow the same track along mountain and river corridor through Mexico , Central and South America in both the fall and spring . In the middl of the contin , bird use all three strategi , though counterclockwis migrat are more common here than elsewher , Dr. La Sort said .Dr. La Sorte team plan to add addit speci to the Western Hemispher map and encourag bird watcher in Africa and Asia to contribut to the project so they can map bird migrat across the globe .', 'CHICAGO  We had just finish the mathematician Eugenia Cheng splendid demonstr of nonassoci where the order of oper count  as it doe in , say , subtract .Now she want to forg ahead with the next lesson , in knot theori .I suggest we wait until later . Whi ?  she ask .Well , we shouldnt eat two dessert befor dinner , should we ?  I said , and giggl nervous .Whi not ?  she repli , not giggl . She tighten her apron string and walk over to her stove .Of cours . What wa I think ? Hadnt Dr. Cheng alreadi made clear her convict that in mathemat , rule are like egg : meant to be broken , stir , flip over and taste-test ? And that day , we had broken a lot of egg .Your absolut right ,  I said , rush to her side for the grand unveil of anoth mathemat theme confect .Dr. Cheng pull from the oven a perfectli bake specimen of what she call Bach pie , name for the great compos belov by mathematician everywher : an oblong rectangl of creami dark chocol stud with banana slice and top by an Escher-lik braid of four glaze pastri plait that follow diverg trajectori , never quit crisscross where you expect them to .The fill wa a clever concaten  BAnana ad to CHocol give you Bach ,  Dr. Cheng said . The braid illustr the structur of a Bach prelud and the sort of pattern that knot theorist studi to see how loop up the braid are ,  Dr. Cheng said , and whether you can transform one braid into anoth by wiggl the differ strings.The pie wa a true union of art and math , too beauti to besmirch , and besid , your not suppos to unti knot with your teeth , are you ?Anoth rule , easili broken .Dr. Cheng , 39 , ha a knack for brush asid convent and edict , like so mani pie crumb from a cut board . She is a theoret mathematician who work in a rarefi field call categori theori , which is so abstract that even some pure mathematician think it goe too far ,  Dr. Cheng said .At the same time , Dr. Cheng is win fame as a math popular , convinc that the pleasur of math can be convey to the legion of numbers-avers human major still recov from high school algebra . She ha been featur on show like Late Night With Stephen Colbert ,  and her onlin math tutori have been view more than a million time .The hardcov edit of her first book , How to Bake  : An Edibl Explor of the Mathemat of Mathemat ,  ha sold about 25,000 copi in thi countri and been translat into six languag , a surpris hit for a text visibl if judici season with number , graph and equat . The book is be releas in paperback thi month .I spend a lot of time explain mathemat on blog , and I tri to cut through the technic and make thing easier to understand ,  said John Baez , a professor of math at the Univers of California , Riversid ( and ye , a cousin of Joan ) . Still , hi post are aim at scientist and other with some quantit background .Eugenia ha gone all the way in ,  he said . She tri to explain math to everybodi , with or without pre-exist expertis , and I think she do wonderfully.So commit is Dr. Cheng to mass math demystif that she recent left a tenur professorship at the Univers of Sheffield in Britain to take a posit at the School of the Art Institut of Chicago , where she teach math to art student , lectur wide and continu her research in categori theori on the side .Dr. Cheng adopt a liter approach to make math more appet . Math is about take ingredi , put them togeth , see what you can make out of them , and then decid whether it tasti or not ,  she said .Everi chapter in How to Bake  offer recip for dessert and other dish that encapsul mathemat theme . To demonstr how math seek to identifi underli similar across a broad set of problem , for exampl , Dr. Cheng start with a recip that can be readili tweak to make mayonnais instead of hollandais sauc .Book might tell you that hollandais sauc need to be done differ ,  she write , but I ignor them to make my life simpler . Math is also there to make thing simpler , by find thing that look the same if you ignor some small detail.Her recip for lasagna illumin the import of context to math . Dr. Cheng list among the basic ingredi fresh lasagna noodl ,  and then point out that anoth cookbook might deem the noodl not truli basic and instead describ their prepar from scratch .So , too , do number chang their charact and degre of basic depend on context . The number 5 , for exampl , when view among the natur , or count , number is one of those element creatur : a prime number , divis onli by 1 and itself .But in the context of the so-cal ration number , which includ fraction , 5 lose it prime ident and gain versatil , abl to be divid into ever tinier sliver , like a cake at a dieters convent .The number 1 in it multipl ident is practic bedridden , leav other number unchang : 6 time 1 equal 6 . In it addit capac , howev , 1 is unstopp : if you keep ad 1 to itself , Dr. Cheng note , you can gener all the natur number , out to infin .Context can prod number to defi grade-school veriti : 2 plu 2 equal 4 , and that that . But not if your talk about a clock face with onli three number : 1 , 2 and 3 . In that case , 2 plu 2 equal 1  if you start at the 2 and move clockwis by 2 , you reach 1 .I admit I wa skeptic at first about her analog to cook , but I end up be complet sold ,  said Steven Strogatz , a professor of appli mathemat at Cornel Univers who also write popular book .She convey the spirit of invent and creativ in math that all mathematician feel but do a veri poor job commun when teach math . Refresh is the word that keep come to mind.Dr. Cheng wear glass , ha long black hair and walk with an eleg , upright postur , like a dancer . She is altern outgo and reserv , passion and matter-of-fact . She is a classic train musician and own a 1910 Steinway grand piano .She is also an extrem good cook . On a recent afternoon , we are in her well-stock kitchen , and she is stir a mix of egg yolk , sugar and cream  my lesson in nonassoci , otherwis known as custard . Thi is someth where the way you combin ingredi count , she said .If your make a cake , you can throw togeth the flour , sugar , butter and egg howev you pleas , and the cake will come out fine  that an associ process . Not so for prepar custard . You must first combin the sugar and egg yolk and whisk them into a froth befor you pour in the cream .Blend the ingredi in a differ order , she said , and you end up with a runni mess.In math , too , you have associ oper like addit and multipl , where you can chang how your number are whisk togeth as you calcul and still emerg with the same answer : ( 4+5 ) + 6 is the same as 4+ ( 5+6 ) .Subtract , divis and exponenti are nonassoci oper : Who clump with whom matter . So , while 10- ( 6-4 ) will give you 8 , ( 10-6 ) -4 leav you with noth .Dr. Cheng continu stir the custard , peer into the pot to ensur that lump arent form . Peopl ask me , do you eat your custard warm or cold ?  she said . I tell them , I eat it all at once.She adjust the temperatur of the burner , up and down , up and down . Get the custard to come out just right can be tricki , she said  harder than do math , and more like live life .Dr. Cheng insist that the public ha it all wrong about math be difficult , someth that onli the gift mathlet among us can do . To the contrari , she say , math exist to make life smoother , to solv those problem that can be solv by appli math most power tool : logic .Scienc may depend on form hypothes , do experi and gather evid that support or refut your hypothesi , but math is simpli a matter of state the term of your argument and then defend those statement use logic .The great thing about math is you dont need much to start explor it ,  Dr. Baez said . No expens equip , just pencil and paper , and you can start fiddl around with pattern and numbers.The key to think logic is to get comfort with abstract . Number are one type of abstract that we take for grant : The number 3 can stand in for 3 banana , 3 pie , 3 Bach partita .The next step up in abstract is to replac specif number by symbol like x and y , a power maneuv that allow you to appli your argument more broadli , just as a general-purpos recip for pie can be the vehicl for banana , blueberri , pumpkin , nut , knot , you name it .As an exampl of abstract at work , How to Bake  present thi littl brain teaser : My father is three time as old as I am now , but in 10 years time , he will be twice as old as me . How old am I ? It then take the reader through the solut by way of x-i abstract . *Dr. Cheng recogn that peopl can feel uncomfort with some of the abstract requir by mathemat think , by the need to ignor the particular of , say , thi green round pillow and that squar purpl pillow in favor of an abstract ideal of a pillow that your go to call x .But it just a matter of practic , she said , befor the idea start to feel like a real object that you can manipul with eas . You becom veri good at separ what relev from what isnt , and that can be veri use in daili life ,  she said .Sometim , she find it oddli satisfying to mental shave a beard man or imagin how a furri dog would look like after a swim in a lake . That what abstract is ,  she said . You reveal the structur underneath.Dr. Cheng upbring in rural Sussex as one of two daughter led her readili to math love . Their mother , a statistician who had been consid the most brilliant math student at her Hong Kong high school , would keep her girl entertain at the beach for hour with book of logic puzzl .And becaus their mother commut each day to a London account firm while their father had a child psychiatri practic near home , the girl grew accustom to the idea of a briefcas mother and a father who made dinner .I think Eugenia and I both benefit from the atyp setup ,  said Alethea Cheng Fitzpatrick , Dr. Cheng older sister and now an architect in New York . We didnt go into adulthood with ani preconcept about gender role or gender abilities.Later , dure graduat school at Cambridg Univers and three postdoctor fellowship in Europ and the Unit State , Dr. Cheng would often find herself in a tini minor . Iv been to confer where there were more cubicl in the women bathroom than there were women to use them ,  she said .Today , in the Unit State , less than 30 percent of graduat student and about 12 percent of tenur faculti member in math are women . Dr. Cheng is strive to chang attitud across the board . I want to be a role model for men as well as women ,  she said .The custard is readi . The ideal becom real . I finish the first bowl , and ask for more .* Let x be me and y be my father . Today , y=3x . In 10 year , my father will be y+10 and twice my age , so y+10=2 ( x+10 ) . Sinc 3x=i , we can get rid of the y in that equat , as 3x+10=2 ( x+10 ) . And sinc 2 ( x+10 ) is the same as 2x+20 , we can now say 3x+10=2x+20 . Final , subtract 2x from both side of the equat and you get x+10=20 . Therefor , x=10 , and I am 10 year old .', 'Earlier thi month , the Scienc staff publish a seri of short articl call Misconceptions. The idea : to debunk some common misconcept about health and scienc that mani peopl accept as truth in their everyday live .Most of the stori got a lot of reaction from reader but the one I wrote , headlin Exercis Is Not The Path to Strong Bones caus a small uproar in our inbox .I want to tri to clear up some misconcept about thi Misconception.As a distanc runner who ha run five marathon  and someon who tri to work out almost everi day  I would never want to leav the impress that peopl shouldnt exercis . But I also want to be honest about what can realli be accomplish . As my articl said , exercis certainli ha some establish benefit  but strengthen adult bone enough to prevent fractur is not one of them .I wish I had made it clearer that my focu wa on weight-bear exercis for adult onli . The mani reader who wrote in are correct that exercis can help build strong bone in children and adolesc whose bone are still grow and develop , although there is some uncertainti over how much and what sort of exercis is best .My intent wa to address the mani , mani middle-ag or older reader who have read or heard or been told that all you have to do is walk regularli or do other modest weight bear exercis and your age bone will be strengthen and your risk of fractur reduc .I should have been clearer about the differ between bone densiti and bone strength . Increas bone densiti doe not necessarili mean increas bone strength . Bone densiti can be mislead  fluorid , for exampl , increas densiti but doe not prevent fractur . Calcium supplement increas densiti by 1 to 2 percent but they do not prevent fractur .The reason for mention densiti at all is in the context of whether exercis ha ani notic effect on bone architectur .

Mani exercis studi had veri few subject who were studi for short period of time and that show , at best , an effect on bone densiti that wa extrem small , and that did not determin whether the exercise effect on bone , if ani , reduc fractur .

Befor hi trip , Mr. Hogan use a softwar program call Stellarium to help him pinpoint the planets locat . When he got to the park he use a mobil app call Sky Guid to home in on Mercuri , Venu , Mar , Jupit and Saturn .He said it wa challeng to fit Mercuri into the shot becaus the planet wa so low on the horizon , and within an hour it vanish in the sunlight . For thi pictur , he use a Canon 7D with an 8 mm fishey len with 10 second exposur ( attempt to captur the faraway planet with the limit capac of one cellphon seem to have thwart a number of Instagramm ) .Though it wa about 25 degre Fahrenheit outsid , he said he and hi boy , 8 and 5 , enjoy the adventur .I love share thi moment with my son ,  he wrote in an email . They brave the earli morn cold to share that moment with their dad.', 'PORTLAND , Ore.  Ruth Mile , 83 , sat in a wheelchair in a small exam room , clutch a water bottl , look frighten and uncomfort .She wa submit to the tender scrutini of Dr. Elizabeth Eckstrom , who scoot her stool so close that she wa knee to knee with her patient .Ms . Mile had broken her pelvi after trip on an electr cord in her apart . The week sinc then had been hellish , she told her doctor . At the rehab center , incapacit and humili , she had cri for help from the bathroom . Her hand were cover with bruis from the blood thinner she wa on . She winc as Dr. Eckstrom tug slightli at a bandag that adher stubbornli to her left elbow . Well have to get that chang ,  Dr. Eckstrom said softli .Dr. Eckstrom , 51 , who spend her day focus on the complex medic need of older patient , is , like the Central African okapi , a speci that is rever , rare and endang . She is a geriatrician .Geriatr is one of the few medic specialti in the Unit State that is contract even as the need increas , rank at the bottom of the list of specialti that intern medicin resid choos to pursu .One of the greatest stori of the 20th centuri wa that we doubl the life expect of adult ,  said Terri Fulmer , presid of the John A. Hartford Foundat , which fund program to improv the care of older adult . Now we need to make sure we have all the support in place to assur not just a long life but a high qualiti of that long life.Here in Oregon , there is approxim one geriatrician for everi 3,000 peopl over 75 . The shortag will grow more acut as the state popul continu to age .Oregon problem is mirror across the Unit State . Accord to project base on censu data , by the year 2030 , roughli 31 million American will be older than 75 , the largest such popul in American histori . There are about 7,000 geriatrician in practic today in the Unit State . The American Geriatr Societi estim that to meet the demand , medic school would have to train at least 6,250 addit geriatrician between now and 2030 , or about 450 more a year than the current rate .Yet , the field is becom even less popular among physician in train . Oregon Health and Scienc Univers , where Dr. Eckstrom practic , had five slot open for geriatr fellow for 2016 and fill onli three .Last year , Dr. Elizabeth White-Chu , who direct the university geriatr fellowship program , said she had resort to cold-cal resid program throughout the Pacif Northwest in search of candid . Thi year , there were so mani unfil slot around the countri that Dr. White-Chu did not even bother to call . It would have been a total wast of time.A geriatrician is a physician alreadi certifi in intern or famili medicin who ha complet addit train in the care of older adult . In addit to provid clinic care , geriatrician are skill in navig the labyrinth of psycholog and social problem that often aris in the age popul .Part of the reason age ha such a neg connot is thi sens that you cant cure older people problem ,  said Dr. Kenneth Brummel-Smith , a professor of geriatr at Florida State Univers Colleg of Medicin in Tallahasse , Fla. , a state with a particularli sever geriatrician shortag . And yet a good geriatrician can bring someon back to function status.Peopl avoid the field for understand reason . Geriatr is among the lowest-pay specialti in medicin . Accord to the Medic Group Manag Associ , in 2014 , the median yearli salari of a geriatrician in privat practic wa $ 220,000 , less than half a cardiologist incom . Although geriatr requir an extra year or two of train beyond that of a gener internist , the salari for geriatrician is nearli $ 20,000 less .Sinc the health care of older patient is cover mostli by Medicar , the feder insur program low reimburs rate make sustain a geriatr practic difficult , mani in the field say .Medicar disadvantag geriatrician at everi turn , pay whatev is ask for medic and procedur , but a pittanc for tough care-plan ,  said Dr. Joann Lynn , a geriatrician and the director of the Center for Elder Care and Advanc Ill at Altarum Institut , a nonprofit health system research organ base in Ann Arbor , Mich .Dr. Eckstrom said she knew of sever board-certifi geriatrician in Oregon who , in order to avoid attract too mani older patient , went into practic as gener internist , make certain not to mention their geriatr train . With too mani Medicar patient in their practic , they wouldnt be abl to make end meet ,  she said .Mari Hall , 84 , who live in Portland , know all too well the difficulti of find a geriatrician . A littl over a year ago , sever month after Ms. Hall underw back surgeri that left her with nerv damag , her longtim geriatrician retir , and the hospit did not replac her .Eventu Ms. Hall got in touch with Marci Cottrel Houl , a Portland author who had just written a book with Dr. Eckstrom . To Ms. Hall relief , Ms. Houl help get her in to see a new colleagu of Dr. Eckstrom .I knew I need that kind of special care ,  Ms. Hall said , that I need to think ahead for when the downhil slide realli comes.Some primari care physician argu that geriatrician are unnecessari , that most ailment among older adult are the same as those that hit the middle-ag popul , such as diabet , hypertens and heart diseas . The differ , they say , is that older patient just have more of them .Thi is simpli untru ,  Dr. Eckstrom said . Just think about dementia , or delirium caus by a medic . Those are just two condit you seldom see in middle-ag adults.Dr. Eckstrom embodi both the frustrat and gratif that character a geriatrician day . She spent most of her 40 minut with Ms . Mile sweep up after the caregiv who had preced her : pressur ulcer , a wound dress poorli , dehydr , depress .She gave her patient a pep talk , urg her to be up and walk as much as possibl , and to take in more fluid . She comment on her patient brightli color shoe . Throughout the morn , in fact , she made a point of admir someth each patient wa wear : a bright piec of jewelri , a color scarf , an all-purpl outfit .Then , as if Ms . Mile were do her doctor a person favor , Dr. Eckstrom ad , I veri much appreci that your not take too much of the oxycodone.At the end of the appoint , Dr. Eckstrom took Ms. Miles hand and said , You can alway call me.Your too busi ,  Ms . Mile said .Ill squeez you in . Ill make it work.Ms . Mile had arriv at her appoint defeat and anxiou . By the end , she wa relax , even anim .I know how lucki I am to have her ,  she said as a nurs care remov the bandag on her elbow and replac it with one that would not stick to the wound .That afternoon , Dr. Eckstrom work with three resid who were on a rotat that includ geriatr . When the resid went in to see patient , they were engag enough , but decidedli ho-hum about the specialti , voic a prefer for more vibrant field like oncolog , with it experiment new drug , and cardiolog , which combin good pay with the excit of new technolog .Young physician in train find it difficult to muster interest in the slow grind of care for older patient , and day fill with discuss about medic manag , insomnia , memori loss and Meal on Wheel deliveri .An old famili member is often the inspir for medic student who choos geriatr . Mi grandmoth wa one of my best friend when I wa grow up ,  said Dr. Emili Morgan , 37 , who recent join Dr. Eckstrom in her practic . Dr. Morgan said that watch her grandmother declin after a car accid , follow by a terribl pain death , instil in her a deep belief in the inher digniti and worth of a life , especi toward the end.Chase West , a second-year medic student at Florida State , wa present for much of hi own grandmother declin . Just see how the specialist work with her in the last two month trigger that light-bulb moment ,  he said .Dr. Eckstrom wa a gener internist who practic in primari care for nine year befor return to Oregon Health and Scienc Univers to complet a geriatr fellowship . I thought I wa do a good job care for my patient ,  she said . But I want to do more geriatr teach and research. The fellowship open her eye . I had no idea what I didnt know ,  she said .Phylli Wolf , 76 , ha been see Dr. Eckstrom for more than 12 year . Two year ago , she had a seri of mini-strok that affect her memori . Then she develop two small-bowel obstruct , and each surgeri wa follow by signific cognit declin and delirium . Her gait wa unsteadi , and she wa in danger of fall .Ms. Wolfe health gradual improv not by virtu of drastic intervent , but from care attent to everi possibl detail . Dr. Eckstrom stop Ms. Wolfe prescript for Ambien , an insomnia drug that can caus confus in older patient . Dr. Eckstrom also suggest an exercis program to prevent a fall , and put Ms. Wolf on a nutrit plan .In Dr. Eckstrom offic that day , Ms. Wolf wa transform  live and clearhead . If you hadnt seen her six month ago , youd never know she had all those problem ,  Dr. Eckstrom said .Ms. Wolf pass a standard memori test with eas , and the appoint turn into a session of help hint that seem almost homespun but were back by evid .Elev your leg for 30 minut befor go to sleep and youll need to go to the bathroom dure the night less often ,  Dr. Eckstrom said when Ms. Wolf ask about need to stay well hydrat , then have her sleep disrupt by frequent trip to the bathroom .Instead of iron pill , buy a cast-iron skillet , one of the best way for the bodi to absorb iron ,  Dr. Eckstrom advis in respons to Ms. Wolfe concern about iron pill .Ms. Wolf said she had tri to get a few of her friend in with Dr. Eckstrom , with littl luck . Her practic is full .Dr. Eckstrom began take care of Ms. Wolf when she wa 64 . Dr. Eckstrom said she prefer to start with patient when they are still rel young , so she can follow them into old age .The major of my patient are in their 80 and 90 , but Iv been see mani of them for 20 year ,  she said , ad that care for these patient is less complex , as they have enter old age in better shape .While mani in geriatr have resign themselv to their predica , some believ the field will soon receiv the recognit it deserv . New payment model that hold doctor and health system account for keep peopl healthi are on the rise , and geriatrician forese a day when they are better valu and compens .A lot of us are sick of the whine ,  said Dr. Rosann M. Leipzig , a geriatrician and professor at the Icahn School of Medicin at Mount Sinai , which is experi with a two-year program that combin geriatr and palli care .And there is an emerg emphasi on train mani differ health care profession  nurs , pharmacist , intern and famili medicin physician , physician assist , and physic and occup therapist  to see older patient through a geriatr len rather than focus sole on creat more geriatrician . Mini-fellowship at teach hospit to train practic physician in geriatr have sprung up around the countri . Cardiolog , urolog , emerg medicin and other specialti are promot geriatr train and research within those disciplin .Acknowledg an older person need for digniti is an import part of Dr. Eckstrom practic . When talk with a patient about give up drive , she refer to it as retir from drive ,  cast it as an act of liber , as if drive were a job to be freed of .It is that kind of perspect that drew the attent of traine alreadi attract to the human side of medicin . Dr. Kathleen Drago grew to love geriatr while train under Dr. Eckstrom . I got caught in Elizabeth web ,  she said . You meet peopl who have walk these incred path , and are start to reflect on their live and focu in on what import in the time they have left.Dr. Drago , 31 , left medic school with a debt of around $ 270,000 . I made a decis that wa distinctli against my own financi interest ,  she said . But I come to work everi day , and I get to deliv the patient-cent care that I dream of as a med student.She now work as a geriatrician at Oregon Health and Scienc Univers , see onli hospit patient . Recent evid about care provid by geriatr team show that with the care of such team , the hospit of older adult run shorter , cost less and result in fewer complic , includ fall , pressur ulcer and urinari tract infect .While make her round in the hospit one recent afternoon , Dr. Drago introduc herself to a 79-year-old woman in the intens care unit . The patient , who ha dementia , had been found lie on the ground the previou night a quarter-mil from her home , bruis and bloodi , with three crack rib and bleed in her brain . She had left the hous with a Bibl in one hand and an American flag in the other .Dr. Drago sat down and began a frank yet gentl convers with the patient and her daughter about the next step . The doctor stay for two hour .', 'NAPA , Calif.  San Francisco Bay , the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and the watersh that feed them make up one of the world largest estuari system , a wildli vari tableau of beach , river , creek , grassland and tidal marsh . Forti percent of the land in California drain into thi rich ecosystem .More than 20 year ago , the San Francisco Estuari Institut , a nonprofit scientif advisori group , began an ambiti effort to guid the restor of thi landscap . But the scientist there soon ran into a huge , unanticip question : What should the restor terrain look like , and how should it natur system function ?The natur ecolog of the Bay Area wa thoroughli demolish long ago , overrun by farm , citi and suburb . There were few intact environ left anywher in the region to serv as a guid .There a 150-year gap in our memori ,  said Robin Grossing , a senior environment scientist at the institut . To fill that gap , he and hi colleagu began to scour histor record of the bay and coast for clue to how the California landscap onc look .The institute histor ecolog program ha sinc evolv into one of the largest and most success effort to restor an ecosystem by gather evid on how it onc wa . The clue have come from a rang of sourc : tatter diari and journal left by trapper and pioneer , yellow map made by the first Spanish explor and survey crew , earli aerial photo and narr record a centuri ago from nativ peopl who onc live there , and even pollen deposit and tree ring .There a ton of inform out there ,  Erin Beller , one of the institute three histor ecologist , said as she review map , photo and landscap paint at the group offic . It scatter , but it out there . We trawl dozen of archiv to find that transform data. Pay dirt might be a journal entri about a hors that fell into the river , for exampl , that give us channel depth ,  she ad .In a painstakingli complex process develop by Mr. Grossing , the myriad data glean from thousand of histor sourc are winnow and fed into a geograph databas , small bit that , like pixel , come togeth to creat imag of a forgotten landscap .The first time I heard a present on thi , it took my breath away ,  said Jame Cloern , an expert on the ecolog of estuari with the Unit State Geolog Survey . It a complet new perspect on thi place.The institut gather the research and then work with govern , privat compani and other nonprofit to do the restor . While there are other histor ecolog project  includ the Welikia Project , which reconstruct the origin ecolog of New York five borough  none have serv on-the-ground restor the way thi one ha .The goal isnt just to make thing look as they onc did , here and there , but also to restor vanish ecolog function that will help the West Coast adapt to a chang climat , a tall order in a thoroughli urban environ .Wev alter the landscap so deepli you cant just plant tree ,  said Letitia Grenier , a senior scientist with the institut . We have to restor the hydrolog process , the flood process .You have to learn how it use to work to understand how it want to work.One of the signatur achiev of the estuari institute approach lie along the Napa River , which flow to the bay through the famou winemak valley . When the river wa straighten and deepen begin in the earli 20th centuri , it marsh and tidal flat were fill in .Those featur onc absorb and held period floodwat . Turn the river into a deeper channel led to seriou flood in downtown Napa , and the increas flow lower the river bottom , incis bank as deep as 25 feet .In 1999 , Mr. Grossing and hi team decid that restor the Napa River would requir learn more about how it and the valley onc look and function . With hundr of old photograph , map and other sourc , the ecologist manag to piec togeth a detail portrait of the Napa as natur intend it .A six-foot-long survey map from 1858 show the river meander in rich detail . An earli 20th-centuri photo of a woman wash cloth in the river reveal broad , shallow river bank , while an 1880 paint by Jule Taverni portray season wetland with wildflow meadow and lush veget .The histor studi requir 10 year and deepli inform effort to restor the river , which , as it turn out , meant give it more room to roam , though far from restor it origin cours .Some vineyard owner agre to surrend land valu at up to $ 400,000 an acr so the river could reclaim it . The Napa Counti flood control agenc built five mile of new marshland and plain so that the river could flood along it cours natur instead of overwhelm the citi of Napa .Wer tri to recov the natur flood control function of the river ,  said Jorgen Blomberg of ESA PWA , a river restor firm , who design and guid the construct of mani of the new featur of the Napa River .The project also creat new ecolog nich . No one knew there were onc beaver on the river , for instanc . But research at the institut found an entri in a fur trapper journal from 1833 : Found a few beaver ,  it said , an assert corrobor by refer from histor studi .So the rodent have been allow to re-establish their dam , includ one within view of downtown Napa . The dam will slow eros and creat deep pool , offer a nurseri for young fish  some of them threaten  and help rebuild the river .It amaz the wildlif that ha come into thi area ,  Richard Thomass , who head watersh and flood control for the counti , said recent as he look out over the new marsh .When complet over the next decad , some 30 mile of the Napa River main channel will have been enhanc and reclaim .The institut also is work on restor the valley oak savanna , global uniqu ecosystem . Long ago , the grassland of Napa Valley were dot with grove of tower , centuries-old valley oak , which had broad canopi and pendul branch .The tree were almost complet clear for farm . Mr. Grossing estim there were onc 40,000 to 50,000 valley oak and hundr of grove ; there are now onli some 700 oak and just one grove , on a farm name Oak Knoll , protect by it owner , the Lamoreaux famili .By studi that grove and gather relev histor record , includ earli aerial photograph and the account of visitor like Robert Loui Stevenson and the first Spanish rancher , expert now have a strong sens of what an oak savanna wa onc like .A great varieti of oak stood , now sever , now in a becom grove , among the field and vineyard ,  Stevenson wrote in a travel sketch .Restor the savanna ecolog function is a challeng in what is now a highli develop valley . But valley oak are drought-toler , and may be abl to surviv a drier and hotter futur .The oak are realli import for biodivers in the valley ,  said Shari Gardner , the execut director of Friend of the Napa River , an advocaci group that is attempt to re-oak area of the valley . Each tree is like a littl rain forest.That mean it host hundr of speci , from pileat and acorn woodpeck to scrub jay and pallid bat . Ms. Gardner group ha plant 400 tree , and plan to plant 5,000 more in the next three year with the help of local schoolchildren .The use of histori to guid restor ha been so success in the Bay Area that offici elsewher in California have engag the eco-detect at the institut to search for clue to other vanish natur system . Now there are more than a dozen other recording-gath project underway in place like San Diego and the Tijuana River .The histori of a landscap draw peopl in ,  Mr. Grossing said , in a way ecolog alon doesnt.', 'TO THE EDITOR :Re Chicken Werent Alway Dinner for Humans by ( Jan. 19 ) : The claim that chicken get no respect is not quit true .

There are a few account of what happen . The student , Donald R. Currey , said in a PB documentari that the normal approach to core a tree wa not work , so he cut it down with the help of some forest . Member of the forest servic said he got hi drill bit stuck in the tree , and he and the forest cut it down to remov hi tool . Onli after the tree had been fell and he count it ring did he realiz that he had just slain the oldest known tree on Earth , which wa then a wizen 4,900 year old .Methuselah wa nearli 4,790 by the time anyon realiz just how except it wa . Edmund Schulman , a scientist with the Univers of Arizona Laboratori of Tree-R Research , calcul it age in 1957 .Of cours , it not possibl to say that ani given tree is definit the oldest tree on Earth becaus not all tree have been analyz in thi way . But dendrochronologist  peopl who studi the age of tree  have examin at least ten of thousand of tree around the world sinc then , and none have been confirm to be as senior as Methuselah .To pin down the date ( or era ) of Methuselah birth , Dr. Schulman took sever sampl from the tree use a tool call an increment borer and match up the ring pattern from each sampl to travel back in time ,  said Matthew Salzer , a research associ at the Laboratori of Tree-R Research . Becaus bristlecon pine like Methuselah do not have cylindr trunk  they are twist by the wind into natur sculptur  take sampl from differ part of the tree can give an estim of the tree age , Dr. Salzer said .In the Ancient Bristlecon Pine Forest , the part of Inyo Nation Forest where Methuselah live ( that as specif as the forest servic will get ) , there are mani ancient tree . There is no way to know a tree age just by look at it , Dr. Salzer said . But it doe usual have certain marker that can tip off research to it old age : smooth bark , thick branch or a spike top where the tree ha die in place .It possibl that anoth tree could steal the crown from Methuselah  possibl befor it turn 4,848 . Some organ have suggest that there is a tree in the same forest that is 5,065 year old . But the exist of thi tree , and it age , could not be confirm by the forest servic , the Laboratori of Tree-R Research or the Archangel Ancient Tree Archiv .Research are still investig thi other tree , said Debra Schweizer , a spokeswoman for Inyo Nation Forest , who point out that bristlecon pine grow so slowli , about one-hundredth of an inch in a good year , that it make it difficult to accur determin their age .She also caution visitor against fixat too much on ancient celebr like Methuselah .If you are so focus on see that tree , you are liter miss the forest for the tree ,  she said .Even as safe as the tree may be from an onslaught of gawker and vandal , Methuselah can not ward off the inevit : The trunk of bristlecon pine begin to die around their 1,000th birthday .But even if Methuselah were to last onli a few hundr more year , it ha been quit a life . To put thing in perspect , Methuselah , name for the biblic figur who live to be 969 year old , had long sinc spread it root in the soil when the Egyptian began build the pyramid , and democraci would not begin for anoth 2,212 year .', 'Q . Whi doe arthriti tend to develop in joint that have experienc trauma earlier in life ?A . The condit known as post-traumat arthriti develop after about half the case of traumat joint injuri .

They are not go to suck your blood , eat your food or destroy your house.To do their studi , the research crawl around home wear kneepad and head lamp , and use forcep as well as an aspir to suck up sampl that they later studi under microscop .The scientist are now expand their studi to includ home on all seven contin .Wer aim to find out more about arthropod in differ kind of hous and in differ climat ,  Dr. Trautwein said .', 'There are about 920,000 pygmi in central Africa , but their forest commun are fragment and endang by log , mine and land clearanc , accord to a consortium of research who collabor to creat the first scientif estim of the size of the popul .Becaus there is so littl censu data on pygmi , especi in the Democrat Republ of Congo , where most of them live , the survey reli on techniqu normal use for count anim and plant .The author gather data from 26 collabor , includ anthropologist , biologist and human right group .Start with the known locat and habit of 654 pygmi camp in five countri , the scientist map out grid of terrain across central Africa where similar camp could exist .Mani pygmi live by hunt , fish , gather and garden-plot farm , so encamp were consid more like to aris in deep rain forest , near river , far from citi and far from the intens farm and anim husbandri practic by other ethnic group .Pygmi are believ to be Africa oldest human popul . They spread out across the contin and then , scientist think , broke into four larg subgroup as wave of other popul  particularli Bantu from the region that is now Nigeria and Cameroon  migrat through their territori and intermarri .Genet , they are relat to the Khoisan peopl of southern Africa who speak click languag .Pygmi are often exploit or even enslav by other group .

There is , for instanc , a strong correl between per-capita chees consumpt and the number of peopl strangl accident by their bedsheet . Slice and dice the profus of data , and there is no end to the coincid that can aris . Some were recent collect in a book call Spuriou Correlations. Year by year , it turn out , the number of letter make up the win word for the Scripp Nation Spell Bee close track the number of peopl kill by venom spider .These are probabl not import clue about the natur of realiti . But the evid for an invers relationship between lung cancer and elev ha been much harder to dismiss .A paper publish last year in the journal PeerJ plumb the question to new depth and arriv at an intrigu explan . The higher you live , the thinner the air , so mayb oxygen is a caus of lung cancer .Oxygen can not compet with cigarett , of cours , but the studi suggest that if everyon in the Unit State move to the alpin height of San Juan Counti , Colo. ( popul : 700 ) , there would be 65,496 fewer case of lung cancer each year .Thi idea didnt appear out of the blue . A connect between lung cancer and altitud wa propos as earli as 1982 . Five year later , other research suggest that oxygen might be the reason .But the author of the PeerJ paper  two doctor student at the Univers of Pennsylvania and the Univers of California , San Francisco  have made the strongest case yet . At the Univers of Pennsylvania Medic School , the paper won last year Abramson Cancer Center prize for basic research . And in Juli it wa chosen as one of PeerJ best paper on cancer biolog .Skeptic were quick to strike back , though not veri effect . A would-b debunk on the Cancer Research UK websit wa quickli follow by a debunk of the debunk .All of the usual caveat appli . Studi like thi , which compar whole popul , can be use onli to suggest possibl to be explor in futur research . But the hypothesi is not as crazi as it may sound . Oxygen is what energ the cell of our bodi . Like ani fuel , it inevit spew out wast  a corros exhaust of substanc call free radic ,  or reactiv oxygen speci ,  that can mutat DNA and nudg a cell closer to malign .That is not a good reason to consum antioxid pill . While the logic may seem sound , there is no convinc evid that these supplement add to nature alreadi formid mean of repair oxid damag  and they may even disrupt some delic biolog balanc , increas cancer risk and speed tumor growth .But there is no question that oxid , so crucial to life , rust our cell and can edg them closer to becom cancer .In examin the possibl that breath itself significantli increas the risk of lung cancer , the author of the paper , Kamen P. Simeonov and Daniel S. Himmelstein , began by elimin confound variabl . Mayb younger , healthier peopl tend to live at higher altitud , with older and weaker one , includ smoker , retreat to lower land . That could creat the illus of a protect altitud effect , but one that ha noth to do with oxygen .The author also took into account factor like incom , educ and race , which affect access to medic care . To reduc distort caus by noisi data , the research exclud counti with larg number of recent immigr , who might have acquir cancer-caus mutat elsewher . Also rule out were place with a larg number of Nativ American , whose cancer rate often go underreport .Beyond the human variabl were geophys one . Air at higher altitud may be less pollut by carcinogen . And sinc sunlight exposur is more intens , mayb the increas in vitamin D help stave off lung cancer  an idea previous suggest . Differ in precipit and temperatur might also have some effect .These data , too , were ad to the scale , along with the influenc of radon ga and ultraviolet ray , which is greater at higher elev . The frequenc of obes and diabet , which are risk for mani cancer , wa adjust for , along with alcohol use , meat consumpt and other factor .After an examin of all these number for the resid of 260 counti in the Western Unit State , situat from sea level to nearli 11,400 feet , one pattern stood out : a correl between the concentr of oxygen in the air and the incid of lung cancer . For each 1,000-meter rise in elev , there were 7.23 fewer lung cancer case per 100,000 peopl . ( The studi found no similar correl for breast , colon and prostat cancer . )That is not a good reason to inhal less deepli at sea level or to flee to the mountain . Wherev you live , smoke account for as much as 90 percent of lung cancer . Radon is consid a distant second caus . But the PeerJ studi complic thing .For variou reason , radon level are gener higher at higher altitud , while lung cancer rate are lower . Doe that mean radon is not so danger after all ? Or are it bad effect offset by the healthi deficit of carcinogen oxygen ?Or mayb radon , like thinner air , protect against lung cancer . Accord to a long-deb hypothesi call hormesi , the earth low level of natur radiat actual might reduc cancer risk .Howev thi all shake out , the studi is a remind that not all carcinogen are manufactur by chemic plant . And not all of them can be avoid . You can quit smoke and mitig the radon in your basement . But you cant mitig oxygen .', 'Sea turtl drift in mysteri current . How long do they live ? How fast do they grow ? When do they reach sexual matur ?Answer to these and other basic question elud research , stymi effort to better understand and protect the world seven marin turtl speci , all but one of which are endang . Now scientist in Hawaii may have resolv some of the unknown by turn to an unlik environment marker : nuclear fallout .As describ in the journal Proceed of the Royal Societi B , the research use bomb radiocarbon , which wind up in the turtles shell through their diet , to estim the birth date , growth rate and age of reproduct matur of critic endang hawksbil sea turtl .In do so , the team also stumbl upon clue to two critic factor plagu the turtl : late matur and poor food sourc .Come into thi , we didnt expect to rais all of these question and red flag , but Im happi it turn into a more complex stori than one simpli about growth and age ,  said Kyle Van Houtan , a conserv ecologist at Duke and the Nation Ocean and Atmospher Administr .Hawksbil turtl are name for their beaki , birdlik face , but their most eye-catch featur is their shell , ornat pattern in honey , chocol and mahogani hue . Collector have long taken note : In the 20th centuri alon , million of hawksbil were kill so their shell could be carv into bracelet , hairpiec , jewelri box and other trinket .Hawksbil were list as an endang speci in 1970 , and intern trade in them wa ban a few year later . Yet in mani part of the world , includ the Unit State , hawksbil have continu to declin . In Hawaii , the turtle number have remain stubbornli low despit a dedic conserv program .Roughli 100 adult live there , with fewer than 20 femal nest per year , make Hawaii hawksbil the world smallest popul of sea turtl .Research believ a simpl lack of inform ha been hold back conserv of the turtl . We know veri littl about hawksbil , even compar to leatherback , loggerhead and green turtl ,  Dr. Van Houtan said . We want to answer some basic biolog question about thi popul in Hawaii.Bomb radiocarbon turn out to be one way to do that . In the mid-20th centuri , the Unit State and sever other countri began conduct open-air nuclear test that significantli increas concentr of carbon 14 , a radioact isotop , in the atmospher . Bomb radiocarbon began taper off onli in the 1970 , with the end of widespread nuclear test .Carbon 14 doe not harm plant and anim , but it doe accumul in their tissu at vari level . Research figur out how much carbon 14 exist at a particular moment in histori by use so-cal refer specimen . A coral collect from a certain reef in Hawaii in 1975 , for exampl , would provid a marker of carbon 14 level for that place and year .Becaus bomb radiocarbon vari in a characterist way over time , compar level in a refer materi with those in a shell or bone of unknown age allow research to determin when it form  a method that scientist regularli use for estim the age of shark or other long-liv fish . Until now , howev , the method had not been tri on sea turtl .Dr. Van Houtan and hi colleagu comb museum and govern archiv to find shell sampl from 36 hawksbil  23 from Hawaii , the rest from other Pacif site . All of the turtles death date were known , span 1962 to 2013 .The research then use coral sampl to build a comput model of background level of radiocarbon in the Hawaiian archipelago from 1900 to 2012 . Becaus the turtl accru tissu in their shell throughout life , concentr of radiocarbon in the most recent form layer can be compar with the corals carbon 14 record for the same year .Those valu , howev , dont correspond exactli , becaus coral acquir carbon directli through the water while turtl do so through diet . The team wa abl to adjust for the differ and thu estim each turtle date of birth .In a final step , the research appli the radiocarbon result , along with known measur from captiv and wild-caught turtl , to a mathemat model that could estim an animal growth rate . The result gave Dr. Van Houtan and hi colleagu an idea of how old their turtl were when they hit matur .The age at which sea turtl begin breed depend on how well they are fed . Not surprisingli , the team found that anim rais in captiv grew the fastest , reach matur at 12 year . Wild turtl from place besid Hawaii hit that benchmark at 12 to 15 year .The Hawaiian turtl , though , were extrem late bloomer , hold out for an averag of 29 year befor they began breed . Thi mean someth in the environ in Hawaii is suboptim , and significantli so ,  Dr. Van Houtan said .To discov what that something might be , he and hi colleagu took a closer look at the radiocarbon level in coral and turtl . The differ should have been constant over the year . But in recent decad , the research discov , level found in coral and turtl shell have becom strikingli similar , indic a shift in the turtles diet toward the bottom of the food chain .Hawksbil are normal omnivor , eat spong , crustacean , alga and more , but it appear the popul in Hawaii is go vegetarian  a chang the research suspect is link to the declin of Hawaii coral reef over the last centuri . Declin of the reef mean declin of other speci in that ecosystem that hawksbil reli on for food ,  Dr. Van Houtan said .Brendan Godley , the director of the Center for Ecolog and Conserv at the Univers of Exet in Britain , who wa not involv in the research , said , The team ha assembl a uniqu data set give interest and import inform on the life histori of a speci of intens conserv interest , and also give a tantal insight into possibl broad-scal chang in the ecolog of the Hawaiian Islands.If such studi could be replic across the Pacif and other ocean basin , we could attain a superb window into the long-term ecolog of individu sea turtl , popul and their ecosystem ,  Dr. Godley ad .Dr. Van Houtan believ the new method could easili be appli to other marin turtl popul around the world , though hi focu remain on hawksbil .I want thi work to shine a light on the plight of hawksbil ,  he said . Mi goal is to demonstr the urgenc of some of the problem that the Hawaiian popul faces.', 'Doe ani modern American doctor or patient get through a day without think wist of simpler time ? The process of provid or secur even basic health care is so endlessli complic now , so peril and frustrat , so entrepreneuri and expens . Everyth wa so much easier in the old day . Just beam us back , someon , pleas .Well , we can all blame our inner Norman Rockwel for that littl fantasi : As the historian Nanci Tome outlin in a seamless and utterli fascin narr , the good old day never realli exist . ( Read an excerpt ) . For more than a centuri now , American health care ha been a fraught marketplac , host a power struggl among consum , provid and regul that may have escal over the decad but is otherwis remark unchang .Medic historian who focu on the conquest of dire diseas serv up narr of progress and triumph . Not Ms. Tome , a professor of histori at Stoni Brook Univers , who ha chosen to examin instead the health care experi of averag healthi citizen , the great silent major whose live are punctuat by a varieti of minor ill and onli the occasion major calam . These are the peopl seek well in the doctor offic and the drugstor , often inspir by the irresist new and improved slogan that motiv other shopper .We like to think that present-day well hunter , inform by the Internet and arm with their insurer cash , are uniqu well-educ and empow consum . But it turn out they are neither so empow nor quit so uniqu .Patient actual morph into consum long befor health insur and the Internet were invent , even befor the turn of the 20th centuri , when medic scienc first began to strut it stuff . Befor then , American health care wa a fairli free-form enterpris , full of do-it-yourself manual and tradit cure . But the combin power of scienc and modern consum capit chang all that : Suddenli everyon want a stake in the big game .As Ms. Tome method trace event in the offic and the pharmaci over the last centuri , today common complaint appear again and again .Do you feel dehuman as a 21st-centuri patient becaus modern medic care is all about the technolog ? Sad to say , that process began long ago . It wa back in the 1920 that doctors offic first load up with machineri in order to impress patient with new and improved medic care .The first timesav questionnair for patient to complet in the wait room wa introduc in 1949 . By 1960 , one observ wa mourn that crowd schedules were forc doctor to get through with a patient in five or 10 minutes. That year , Harper Magazin announc a crisi in American medicin ,  thank to which the whole patient wa be lost . A commentari in thi newspap in 1966 griev at length for the disappear of good old Doc.Do you feel batter by the pharmaceut marketplac , full of noisi ad masquerad as inform ? Ms. Tome point out that it wa alway thu : Drug have been enthusiast hawk from the dawn of advertis . In fact , the drug industri pioneer the use of mani of the most aggress tool , like nation ad campaign , direct-mail ad , product placement and infomerci .Whoever shout the loudest sell the most ,  one pharmacist said in the 1920 . Our televis ad for prescript drug were foreshadow long ago by omnipres radio ad , which were onli lightli regul in the 1920 and 1930 .Are you a doctor curs the paperwork and financi worri that destroy 21st-centuri practic ? What Ms. Tome call the corros effect of commerc on medicine scientif standards have been deplor as long as scientif standard have exist . Doctor were alreadi complain in the 1920 that patient just want drug , not good advic . In the 1950 , the American Medic Associ warn that doctor should learn to negoti with a pickier gener of consum .Accept the fact that today patient ha grown up ,  one consult advis in 1958 : The doctor should be more a businessman and less a saint. The burden of insurance-rel paperwork began to engulf medic offic not with manag care , but back in the 1940 .Are you perplex by our regulatori chao , with layer upon layer of well-mean but persist ineffect effort to guarante the safeti of medic servic ? It turn out we come from a long tradit of such inadequaci : Patient safeti ha been the holi grail for everyon , long sought , never achiev .Drug regulatori effort have been inconsist and confus . ( At one point in the 1940 , peppermint drop were avail by prescript , while strychnin could be freeli purchas by anyon ) . An angri book enumer the mani peril of be a patient  100,000,000 Guinea Pigs  wa a best-sel in 1933 .Forti year later , Ralph Nader and hi colleagu tri hard to help patients plight , but neither Consum Report nor the 1973 Patient Bill of Right  a document that is still duli mount on hospit wall everywher  have made health care safe . Of cours , the glut of inform of uncertain proven pour off the Internet ha not manag to do so , either .Ms. Tome write a fluent and immens readabl chronolog , minut referenc , instruct and ruefulli entertain .

Hi wife took that document , shepherd it content to public , and the result book , When Breath Becom Air ,  becam an instant best-sel thi month . Dr. Kalanithi , 36 , is a gener internist at Stanford , where she help lead effort to improv the qualiti and effici of care . She recent fold herself into a leather armchair in her home in the San Francisco Bay Area , the same spot where her husband sat while he wrote , and talk about her own experi  as a young widow in grief , as her husband literari stand-in , and as a physician who wit at intens person rang the end to an extraordinari man life . Here are edit excerpt from the convers .Q . Have you been surpris by the book immens success ?A.It realli exceed my highest hope . A coupl month ago , I ask Paul literari agent , How do you think the book is go to do ?  She said , Well , it either go to do veri well or it wont do well at all . It kind of just depend whether peopl want to read a book about die , by a man who ha died. For me person , it realli a consol in a way .How so ?It been 10 month sinc Paul die , and I still want to talk about him all the time and reminisc about him . For me , it just help to talk , and process , and rememb Paul . Somehow I feel like see the respons to the book and even interact with compassion media are veri wonder for me .The tremend respons to the book must be hearten .Ye , hearten . Wer all go to face ill and death and bereav and difficult medic decis . The respons , I think , is indic people hunger to address these challeng in a real way . What are we do to help each other live and die well ? What should we be talk about that wer not talk about ? Thi book ha a voic in that discuss . That realli excit for me to see .In your epilogu to the book , you wrote about how import it wa to Paul to get thi book done . I want to ask you about the mechan of that . He wrote even when he wa veri sick ?Ye , he went through a lot of physic discomfort to write it . Just sit still for a long time wa hard , and he had troubl with mental focu . Despit the physic suffer , he wa still a veri natur writer , or mayb hi skill at write help him power through all hi physic challeng . But the whole section at the begin of the book , about hi childhood , he wrote that while he had brain metastas . That wa the last thing he wrote .Realli ? The first part of the book wa the last thing he wrote ?Yeah . When he die , I wa on a mission to make sure that document on hi comput got turn into a book , to stand in for him and to make sure it happen . So at first it wa all about thi mission for Paul . Now Im realiz the convers that happen , it one that Paul want to be part of and that I want to be a part of . It a veri excit thing and someth I wa do in my work , but not in thi type of way .What do you mean ?I dont know exactli how to phrase it . I think there thi real opportun in medicin . Wer at thi weird point in histori where we have all thi technolog and the impuls is to keep use it , even if it at time creat more suffer . At a certain point , death is not a medic event , but we still treat it like one . I think you know what I mean by that .I do know .When Paul first got diagnos , I felt not powerless , and I felt like , I have these skill and interest in medicin that are go to serv me take care of Paul.Such as ?I guess the core one wa , He not afraid of die , and Im not afraid to see him die. He wa interest in death as a philosoph problem . We both enter medicin to grappl with big question and how peopl make sens of their live and death . But then suddenli it like  now it on us . It wa super intens and super hard . It took everyth we had to cope , but it wa also like we could ultim find mean , which wa amaz . That wa becaus he could write thi book . I think there would have been more existenti suffer if he didnt have a purpos .You guy made the decis togeth to have Cadi . Paul wa alreadi sick ?Yeah , he wa alreadi sick .What wa that like ?So when we were decid to have Cadi , it wa clear to us that she like wouldnt know Paul , and that I would be a solo parent . I rememb thi thing he said that amaz , that in the book , where I said someth like , Dont you think say goodby to your child will make your death more pain ?  I wa realli worri about that .When you were decid ?Mm-hmm [ affirm ] . I want him to be abl to spend hi time in the way that he want to . I said , Dont you think it will make your death more pain ?  He said , Wouldnt it be great if it did ?  Then  he say thi in the book , too  where he like , We agre that life is not about avoid suffering. It about creat mean .It my job go forward to help shape her narr in a way that make sens for her . I dont know what her relationship with Paul  understand Paul  I dont know what that will be go forward . I have to let her have that , too .My guess is that hell be thi mythic figur to her .I know . That interest . It weird , especi becaus now he a famou writer . When he wa aliv , he wa not a famou writer , but to her , he will be . He wrote the book to her , too .The book is fill with literari refer . What were hi favorit book ?When he wa first diagnos , for a long time hed been super busi , and read neurosurgeri textbook . Then that terribl night when we got the chest X-ray result  I wa pack for the hospit and pack stuff we would need , like phone charger . He just pack book . I think he wa just think , I need book at thi moment . Thi is the worst moment in my life . I need my books. He took Heidegger Be and Time ,  C. . Lewis Mere Christian ,  and Solzhenitsyn Cancer Ward.How did see him through die affect the way you practic medicin ?My career is now focus around health care valu . In resid , I got interest in these bigger question like : What are we get for our money in health care ? Are we get what we aspir to get ? I feel like the experi with Paul solidifi my instinct . It deepen and enrich what I felt like I wa do in medicin alreadi .How doe it feel to have grief , which is someth intens solitari , becom almost a collect experi ?I guess there are a few answer . There real life , then there the book Paul wrote . Then there the book peopl read . Theyr all distinct from each other .  I would expect peopl to project or to take away someth that connect with them , which is differ for differ peopl , or even from what Paul meant .Now that it out there , the book ha a life of it own .Ye . Gavin Franci wrote a blurb for the book . He wrote that the book wa crackl with life. I wa so happi to see crackl with life. It so incred becaus when Paul wa sit in hi chair , so debilit , and wan and thin , he wa total crackl with life . He didnt look like he wa . But he realli wa . He didnt die until he die .Your now a spokeswoman for the both of you .Ye , and there are differ piec to it : I realli wish Paul , for everi reason , wa here to answer these question . I want him here . Im not him . It realli heartbreak and difficult that he not here . Then there the piec  what my role and how do I feel about it . I feel thi respons to Paul to repres him . You could compar it to a health proxi , when patient are realli ill and cant speak for themselv , and your tri to decid how to guid their care . It not a decis about what you as a famili member want . It what they would say if they could sit up and speak .', 'Prairi vole consol one anoth when distress , research have found .Consol ha been observ in anim like chimpanze and eleph , but it wa thought to requir a cognit advanc brain  which the small rodent lack .These vole are not smart , so thi is not an intellig thing ,  said Larri J .

And then the protein float off to do it job .That certainli true . But there more to the stori .Some of our gene dont encod protein ; instead , they creat long RNA molecul that dont serv as protein templat . They have differ job .One of these so-cal long-noncod RNA ( lncRNA , for short ) is vital to women health . Women carri two copi of the X chromosom , of cours , while men have onli one . Yet both sex produc the same number of protein from X chromosom .

Then the cell is abl to produc protein onli from the X chromosom free of Xist . If that bit of RNA fail , women produc extra protein . Studi on mice suggest thi can lead to cancer .Xist is far from a fluke . In a studi publish last year , a team of research identifi more than 58,000 differ kind of lncRNA made by human cell .

To do so , they use an innov method to explor million of year of RNA evolut .Thi is the most power , clear-cut exampl that we should reconsid junk DNA ,  said John Rinn , a cellular biologist at Harvard Univers who wa not involv in the research .One clue that a gene may have an import function is that it hasnt chang much in million of year . Gene mutat tend to be harm , and they are less like to get pass down to futur gener .Scientist have long known that thi is true for protein-encod gene . The gene for hemoglobin , for exampl , are nearli ident in human and chimpanze , despit the fact that our common ancestor live some seven million year ago . In fact , scientist can identifi similar hemoglobin gene in fish , suggest that they have been crucial for vertebr for hundr of million of year .When scientist have use thi method to studi lncRNA , howev , they have often come up dri . Onc a lncRNA gene is identifi in one speci , it can be hard to find version of that gene in relat speci . That failur could be a sign that lncRNA are fleet accid , rather than import , long-liv adapt .Some research have counter that lncRNA evolv differ than protein . Protein fold up into tight , complex structur . lncRNA are long , flexibl strand , with a few hook they use to latch onto certain piec of DNA .Mutat that alter the long stretch of RNA between these hook may not have much effect on how they work . Over million of year , relat lncRNA gene may pick up so mani mutat that their evolutionari histori can be hidden .Dr. Chang and hi colleagu reason that lncRNA gene might still hold onto a littl similar over time and across relat speci : In order for lncRNA to keep work , those hook shouldnt chang much .To test their idea , the scientist investig the histori of one well-studi lncRNA genecal roX , discov in the common fruit fli in 2008 . If roX cant work , male fli die . Subsequ research reveal whi .RoX is the mirror imag of Xist in human . In male fli , roX grab onto the male singl X chromosom and put it into overdr . The amount of gene activ is crank up twofold ,  said Dr. Chang . Thank to roX , male make as mani X chromosom protein as femal and therebi thrive .Dr. Chang and hi colleagu search for roX-lik gene in close relat speci of fli . Instead of tri to find match for the entir roX gene , they onli look for stretch that match the hook-encod part of the gene .They hit pay dirt , identifi roX gene in 47 speci . The fact that these fli share a common ancestor that live 40 million year ago suggest that these newli identifi gene have some impress stay power and encod lncRNA import to surviv .The scientist then look more close at sever fli speci , discov lncRNA made by the newli discov gene on the X chromosom of male fli , just as expect .Dr. Chang team also perform a transplant , replac the roX gene in the common fruit fli with gene from other speci . Fairli often , the transplant gene wa abl to take over roX job and keep male fli aliv . Thi method may help scientist figur out whether other lncRNA are sloppi accid or essenti molecul .In their new report , Dr. Chang and hi colleagu also describ an examin of a long-noncod RNA molecul call HOTAIR , found in human and mice .Like roX and Xist , it ha a crucial job to carri out . It ha an import role in tell cell their locat in the bodi ,  Dr. Chang explain . Without HOTAIR , mice develop a host of birth defect in their skeleton .In their new studi , Dr. Chang and hi colleagu discov that HOTAIR is present not just in human and mice , but in 43 speci of vertebr , a verit menageri includ armadillo , allig and zebrafish .The common ancestor of all of these speci live 400 million year ago . It possibl that HOTAIR wa tell cell their locat in our aquat ancestor even back then .Those experiment test remain to be carri out , said Dr. Chang , but the new work suggest a road map for how to get to that knowledge.', 'Five planet parad across the dawn sky earli Wednesday in a rare celesti spectacl set to repeat everi morn until late next month .Headlin the planetari perform are Mercuri , Venu , Mar , Saturn and Jupit . It is the first time in more than a decad that the fab five are simultan visibl to the nake eye , accord to Jason Kendal , who is on the board of the Amateur Astronom Associ of New York .Admiss to the daili show is free , though stargaz in the Northern Hemispher should plan to get up about 45 minut befor sunris to catch it . Citi dweller can stay in their neighborhood to watch , as long as they point their attent to the east , accord to Mr. Kendal , who took hi telescop to Inwood Hill Park in Manhattan around 4 a.m. Wednesday .Mr. Kendal said he immedi saw Jupit , Mar and Saturn after look into the crystal clear sky . Venu glow as bright as an airplan against the dark when it rose . Aid by hi telescop , he also saw Jupiter moon and Saturn ring .For Mercuri you will need binocular ,  he said . It will not jump out at you , but everybodi should be abl to see Venu and Jupiter.He said that Mercuri , which wa too low to see clearli , will most like becom more visibl on Feb. 5 or 6 when it is at it greatest distanc from the sun along the horizon . The hardest task for viewer is discern the planet from star twinkl in the sky . But Mr. Kendal offer a simpl trick : close one eye , stretch out your arm and slowli pass your thumb over a bright dot in the sky . If the dot slowli dim out when your thumb pass over it , it a planet . If it quickli blink out , it a distant star .The show wa expect to run from Jan. 20 until Feb. 20 , but the peak time to see all five is from the end of Januari until the first week of Februari , when Mercuri is at it highest point , accord to Sky & Telescop . The display is made possibl by the uncommon align of all five planet along what is call the ecliptic plane of their orbit , accord to Jim Green , the planetari scienc divis director at NASA .Over five week , each planet will appear one by one across the sky of the Northern Hemispher . As it did Wednesday morn , Jupit will rise first , emerg sometim at night , while the other four planet will make their debut in the wee hour of the morn . Mar rise second , then Saturn and then Venu  the brightest orb  follow final by Mercuri , which appear about an hour befor sunris .Each morn display will last until the sun come up and make it too bright to see the planet , typic around 7 a.m . It is possibl to find specif time when each planet will rise on a given city horizon by check The Old Farmer Almanac .It not super-often you get to see them all at the same time in the sky , it like see all of your friend at onc ,  said Jacki Faherti , an astronom from the American Museum of Natur Histori .

El trabajador haba escuchado la noticia en la que se anunciaron important descubrimiento de dinosaurio en ese pa , por lo que escarb un poco m alrededor del hueso . Luego acudi a un museo local y le pidi a lo paleontlogo que fueran a buscar m fsile .Mucha gent ha descubierto por casualidad important fsile de dinosaurio . El hallazgo del campesino condujo a la exposicin de lo resto seo de sei de lo m grand titanosaurio conocido . Esto herbvoro vivieron hace uno 100 millon de ao durant el Cretcico superior , en todo lo continent , incluso en la Antrtica . Al parec haba mucho de ello en la tierra del sur .El dinosaurio m imponent de est tipo , cuya rplica se arm a partir de 84 fragmento fsile excavado en la tierra en el extremo sur de Sudamrica , es la muestra m recient de vida antigua exhibida en el Museo de Historia Natur de Nueva York . Hace uno da , el pesado esqueleto hizo su debut como atraccin permanent . Cientfico del museo declararon que debemo aprovechar la oportunidad de ver esta nueva pieza , que se suma a lo cono m popular de la institucin , como la gran ballena azul y el fiero Tyrannosauru rex .Encontrar un nuevo fsil es una experiencia incompar , sobr todo si es tan grande , dijo Michael J. Novacek , director del rea de ciencia y curador de paleontologa . Se espera que nueva investigacion revelen m dato acerca de la fisiologa de lo dinosaurio , y sobr cmo podan crecer y vivir esa criatura gigantesca .En lo ltimo 20 ao , la paleontologa se ha desarrollado meno en el campo de la geologa y m en el de la biologa , afirm Mark A. Norel , president de la divisin de paleontologa en el museo e investigador princip de lo dinosaurio . Mencion que el campo cuenta con nueva herramienta geoqumicas que permiten determinar la dieta as como lo patron de crecimiento y locomocin de esa criatura . Solo somo bilogo que trabajan con fsiles , aadi .Est dinosaurio no solo se conviert en una pieza central de la coleccion de fsile del museo , sino que abr un amplio rango de programa que se desarrollarn en torno a lo dinosaurio durant todo el ao , como alguno simposio y otra exposicin titulada Dinosaur among us , que se inaugurar el 21 de marzo y cuyo objetivo es resaltar descubrimiento important que muestran la estrecha relacin entr lo dinosaurio y alguna ave actual .No fue fcil encontrar un espacio adecuado para el esqueleto de la Patagonia en su nuevo hogar de Nueva York . La pieza mide m de 37 metro de longitud , por lo que es muy larga para la galera . Part de su cuello , de casi 12 metro de largo , se extiend a trav de una abertura en la pare y llega a la zona de elevador , por lo que parec dar la bienvenida a lo visitant que se dirigen a lo piso dedicado a lo fsile .Est titanosaurio era un adulto joven , pero an no se ha determinado su sexo . Con seguridad tena un apetito prodigioso y consuma todo tipo de vegetacin . Basado en el tamao de su hueso , lo investigador calculan que est ejemplar pesaba 70 tonelada , lo que equival al peso de uno 10 elefant africano . Imaginemo qu peso podra haber alcanzado al completar su desarrollo o cmo se vera saciando su enorm apetito , con el largo cuello estirado para alcanzar planta en toda direccion . Con solo comer toda una maana podra haber arrasado con el equivalent a todo el pasto del estadio de lo Yanke .El peso tambin fue un factor al preparar el modelo del esqueleto para su exhibicin , tarea que estuvo a cargo de la organizacin Research Cast Intern , en Canad . Lo fsile real eran demasiado pesado para utilizarlo , as que todo lo huesos se hicieron con fibra de vidrio ligera a partir de copia digital de lo original .Gran part de la agotadora tarea de excavacin que hizo posibl est descubrimiento fue obra de equipo que trabajaron bajo la direccin de Jos Lui Carballido y Diego Pol , paleontlogo del Museo Egidio Feruglio en Argentina . Excavaron por periodo de mese despu de la visita del campesino . Alguna vece se requiri excavar por una semana para aislar un solo fmur o una extremidad anterior . La cadera y la part superior de lo brazo son de vital importancia para calcular la talla y el peso de un dinosaurio .Pol indic que la excavacion revelaron que al meno sei de esto ejemplar gigantesco , todo adulto jvene , murieron en el sitio , que era una llanura cercana a un ro . Fallecieron en tre momento distinto , en intervalo que van desd uno cuanto ao hasta vario siglo . Como mucho animal que se desplazan en manada , es posibl que se hayan rezagado del grupo y hayan muerto de hambr o estr cerca de su abrevadero .Entonc supimo que se trataba de un descubrimiento nico , expres Pol . Lo dinosaurio son la presa preferida de lo cazador de fsile y esto son lo herbvoro de mayor tamao que se han encontrado . La talla y peculiar forma del fmur de casi do metro y medio de un ejemplar dejaron asombrado a lo cientfico . Parec ser una especi de titanosaurio que no se conoca , por lo que todava no tien nombr .Pol seal que prepara un inform dond quiz proponga un nombr formal para esta especi . En un momento de diversin en medio de la excavacion , Pol pidi que le tomaran una fotografa acostado en el suelo al lado del fmur , cuyo tamao aproximado es el de un silln . La fotografa llam la atencin de un paleontlogo del Museo de Historia Natur de Nueva York , dond Pol haba realizado su investigacin de doctorado .A principio del ao pasado , Novacek firm un acuerdo con el museo argentino para construir una rplica del esqueleto y exhibirla en una sala permanent en Nueva York .Uno da ant de desvelar el titanosaurio , mientra alguno trabajador se encargaban de lo toqu final , Norel se detuvo en la entrada , bajo la quijada llena de dient afilado de la atraccin princip .Le garantizo que van a recordar su primera impresin , declar Norel . E impresionant verlo , porqu su tamao y apariencia no se pueden comparar con nada ms .', 'Four year ago , a rancher in the Patagonia region of Argentina came upon an old bone stick out of hi desert properti near La Flecha .With recent news of excit dinosaur find in that countri in mind , he scratch around some more . Then he went to a local museum to ask paleontologist to come look for more fossil .Mani import dinosaur discoveri are made by nonexpert in just thi casual way . The rancher find soon led to the exposur of skelet remain of six of the biggest titanosaur . These herbivor live about 100 million year ago , in the Late Cretac Period , on all contin , includ Antarctica . They seem especi plenti in southern land .Now , the most impos one of these dinosaur from the far south of South America , assembl from 84 fossil piec excav from the rancher land , is the newest eye of ancient life on display at the American Museum of Natur Histori in Manhattan . The hulk skeleton cast made it debut as a perman attract on Friday . Museum offici and scientist call it a must-se addit to the rank of such popular icon as the institution great blue whale and the fierc Tyrannosauru rex .There noth like find a great new fossil , especi such a huge one ,  said Michael J. Novacek , the museum senior vice presid , provost of scienc and a curat of paleontolog .The new research is expect to yield insight into the physiolog of dinosaur and how they were abl to grow and function as such larg creatur .Paleontolog ha becom less geolog and more biolog in the last 20 year or so ,  said Mark A. Norel , chairman of the paleontolog divis at the museum and a lead dinosaur research . He cite the field new geochem tools for determin diet , growth pattern and locomot . All of us are simpli biologist who work on fossil ,  he ad .The exhibit is not onli a centerpiec for the museum fossil collect but also the start of a wide rang of dinosaur program for the year , includ symposium and anoth exhibit , Dinosaur Among Us ,  open March 21 . It will highlight the signal develop in remark research support a close relationship between dinosaur and bird that are aliv today .The Patagonian skeleton wa not an easi fit in it New York home . At 122 feet in length , it wa a bit too long for the galleri . Part of it 39-foot-long neck extend through an open in a wall toward the elev bank , as if to welcom visitor to the fossil floor .Thi titanosaur wa a young adult , gender undetermin . It appetit for all kind of veget must have been prodigi . Base on bone size , research estim that thi individu weigh 70 ton  as much as 10 African eleph , the heaviest land anim today . Think of it possibl heft if it were fulli grown . Think of it satisfi it huge appetit by stretch it long neck to graze far and wide . With onli a few shift in posit , it might have mow the equival of all the grass in Yanke Stadium in a morn .Weight wa also a factor in prepar the skeleton cast for display , a task undertaken by Research Cast Intern in Canada . The actual miner fossil were too heavi to mount . Instead , all bones are made from lightweight fiberglass base on digit copi of the origin fossil .Much of the gruel excav lead to the discoveri wa done by team led by Jos Lui Carballido and Diego Pol , paleontologist at Paleontolog Museum Egidio Feruglio in Argentina . They began excav for month at a time after the rancher visit . Sometim it took a week of dig to isol a singl femur or a forelimb . Thigh and upper arm are critic to judg the size and weight of a dinosaur .Dr. Pol said the excav reveal that at least six of these giant individu , all young adult , had die at the site of what had been a flood plain near a river . Their death had happen at three distinct time , anywher from a few year to centuri apart . Like mani herd anim , they may have becom isol from the group and die of stress and hunger near their water hole .That when we realiz thi wa a once-in-a-lifetim discoveri ,  Dr. Pol said . Dinosaur are the big game to fossil hunter , and these were some of the biggest plant-eat dinosaur ever found .The size and distinct shape of an eight-foot femur of one specimen astonish scientist . Thi appear to be a previous unknown titanosaur speci , yet unnam . Dr. Pol said a report that is be prepar may soon propos a formal speci name .In a bravura moment , Dr. Pol had hi pictur taken stretch out on the ground besid the femur , about the size of a live room couch . The photograph caught the attent of paleontologist at the natur histori museum in New York , where Dr. Pol had done hi Ph.D. research . Mayb we can get that thing ,  one said . That would look great for a renov dinosaur gallery anoth said .Earli last year , Dr. Novacek sign the deal with the Argentin museum to build the full-siz skeleton cast for perman display in New York .On a visit a few day befor the titanosaur unveil , worker were appli finish touch as Dr. Norel paus at the entranc , under the watch eye and toothi jaw of the star attract .I guarante you are go to rememb thi first impress ,  Dr. Norel said . See someth like thi , you dont quit have anyth to compar it size and aspect with.He wa right . The dinosaur wa inexpress strang and big . Onc again , we are remind of what we know : Dinosaur mostli were big , an engag mysteri and a challeng .The titanosaur arriv at the museum may inspir new understand of these incred creatur . It is excit enough to walk a corridor to the fossil galleri in anticip of meet it , and spend some time with old friend of fond memori .Dr. Novacek is not bother by some skeptic that the specimen are from the biggest dinosaur discov so far , and that these may soon be eclips in size by new excav .Everi time we find the biggest dinosaur ,  he said , we soon find a bigger one in the next dig.', 'The latest attempt by SpaceX to recov one of it rocket by land it on a platform in the ocean fail in a ball of fire on Sunday .Shortli befor 11 a.m. on Sunday , SpaceX launch one of it two-stag Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Air Forc Base in California .

But scientist are still debat exactli when and where the ancient bond origin . And a larg new studi be run out of the Univers of Oxford here , with collabor around the world , may soon provid some answer .Scientist have come up with a broad pictur of the origin of dog . First off , research agre that they evolv from ancient wolv . Scientist onc thought that some visionari hunter-gather nab a wolf puppi from it den one day and start rais tamer and tamer wolv , take the first step on the long road to leash and flea collar . Thi is oversimplifi , of cours , but the essenc of the idea is that peopl activ bred wolv to becom dog just the way they now breed dog to be tini or larg , or to herd sheep .The prevail scientif opinion now , howev , is that thi origin stori doe not pass muster . Wolv are hard to tame , even as puppi , and mani research find it much more plausibl that dog , in effect , invent themselv .Imagin that some ancient wolv were slightli less timid around nomad hunter and scaveng regularli from their kill and camp , and gradual evolv to becom tamer and tamer , produc lot of offspr becaus of the rel easi pick . At some point , they becam the tail-wag beggar now celebr as man best friend .Some research question whether dog experi feel like love and loyalti , or whether their win way are just a matter of instinct that evolv becaus be a hanger-on is an easier way to make a live than run down elk . Raymond Copping , a professor emeritu of biolog at Hampshir Colleg , note in hi landmark 2001 book , Dog ,  that best friend is not an ecolog definition. And he suggest that the domest hous dog may have evolv into a parasite.Research also point out that of the estim one billion dog in the world , onli a quarter of them are pet . The vast major of dog run free in villag , scaveng food at dump , cadg the odd handout and caus ten of thousand of human death each year from rabi . They are sometim friendli , but not realli friend .Modern dog are differ from modern wolv in numer way . They eat comfort in the presenc of peopl , wherea wolv do not . Their skull are wider and snout shorter . They do not live in pack structur when they are on their own , and so some scientist scoff at dog-train approach that requir the human to act as pack leader .Wolv mate for the long haul and wolf dad help with the young , while dog are complet promiscu and the male pay no attent to their offspr . Still , dog and wolv interbre easili and some scientist are not convinc that the two are even differ speci , a skeptic that reflect broader debat in scienc about how to defin a speci , and how much the categori is a fact of natur as oppos to an arbitrari line drawn by human .If current divis between speci are murki , the past lie in deep dark . Scientist gener agre that there is good evid that dog were domest around 15,000 year ago . By 14,000 year ago , peopl were buri dog , sometim along with human . But some biologist argu , base on DNA evid and the shape of ancient skull , that dog domest occur well over 30,000 year ago .And as to where the process occur , research studi dog and wolf DNA  most of it modern but some from ancient sourc  have argu in recent year that dog origin in East Asia , Mongolia , Siberia , Europ and Africa .One reason for the conflict theori , accord to Greger Larson , a biologist in the archaeolog depart at the Univers of Oxford , is that dog genet are a mess . In an interview at hi offic here in Novemb , he note that most dog breed were invent in the 19th centuri dure a period of dog obsess that he call the giant whirlwind blender of the European crazi Victorian dog-breed frenzy.That blender , as well as random breed by dog themselv , and interbreed with wolv at differ time over at least the last 15,000 year , creat a tomato soup of dog genet , for which the ingredi are veri hard to identifi , Dr. Larson said .The way to find the recip , Dr. Larson is convinc , is to creat a larg databas of ancient DNA to add to the soup of modern canin genet . And with a colleagu , Keith Dobney at the Univers of Aberdeen , he ha persuad the Who Who of dog research to join a broad project , with about $ 2.5 million in fund from the Natur Environ Research Council in England and the European Research Council , to analyz ancient bone and their DNA .Robert Wayn , an evolutionari biologist at U.C.L.A . who studi the origin of dog and is part of the research , said , There hardli a person work in canin genet that not work on that project.That is someth of a triumph , given the mani compet theori in thi field . Almost everi group ha a differ origin hypothesi ,  he said .But Dr. Larson ha sold them all on the simpl notion that the more data they have , the more cooper the effort is , the better the answer are go to be . Hi person ha been crucial to promot the team effort , said Dr. Wayn , who describ Dr. Larson as veri outgo , gregarious. Also , Dr. Wayn ad , He ha manag not to alien anyone.Scientist at museum and univers who are part of the project are open up their collect . So to gather data , Dr. Larson and hi team at Oxford have travel the world , collect tini sampl of bone and measur of teeth , jaw and occasion nearli complet skull from old and recent dog , wolv and canid that could fall into either categori . The collect phase is almost done , said Dr. Larson , who expect to end up with DNA from about 1,500 sampl , and photograph and detail measur of sever thousand .Scientif paper will start to emerg thi year from the work , some origin in Oxford , and some from other institut , all the work of mani collabor .Dr. Larson is gambl that the project will be abl to determin whether the domest process occur closer to 15,000 or 30,000 year ago , and in what region it took place . That not quit the date , GP locat and name of the ancient hunter that some dog lover might hope for .But it would be a major achiev in the world of canin scienc , and a landmark in the analysi of ancient DNA to show evolut , migrat and descent , much as studi of ancient hominid DNA have shown how ancient human popul the globe and interbr with Neanderth .And whi care about the domest of dog , beyond the obsess interest so mani peopl have in their pet ? The emerg of dog may have been a watersh .Mayb dog domest on some level kick off thi whole chang in the way that human are involv and respond to and interact with their environ ,  he ad . I dont think that outlandish.Dr. Larson is no stranger to wide vari point of view . He is an American , but recent becam a British citizen as well . Hi parent are American and he visit the Unit State often as a child , but he wa born in Bahrain and grew up in Turkey and Japan , place where hi parent were teach in school on American militari base .He graduat from Claremont McKenna Colleg in California and receiv hi Ph.D. at Oxford . In between colleg and graduat studi , he spent a year search for the bed of an ancient river in Turkmenistan , and anoth coupl of year set up an environment consult offic in Azerbaijan . He had an interest in scienc as an undergradu , and some background from a colleg major in environ , econom and polit , but no set career plan . Instead , hi career grew out of intens curios , a knack for make friend and a willing to jump at an opportun , like the time he manag to tag along on an archaeolog dig .He wa stay in Ashgabat , Turkmenistan , and a local man who had help him rent an old Soviet truck to explor the desert told him some Western were arriv to go on a dig , so he wangl hi way onto one of the truck .I think everybodi there thought I wa with somebodi els ,  Dr. Larson said .By the time the group stop to rest and someon ask him who he wa , it wa too late to question whether he realli belong . I wa a complet stowaway ,  he said .But he could move dirt and speak Russian , and he had some recent acquir expertis  in colleg drink game  that he said wa in great demand at night . By luck , he said , the research on the dig turn out to be the great and the good of British neolith archaeology. One of them wa Chri Gosden , the chairman of European Archaeolog at Oxford , who later invit him to do a one-year master 's degre in archaeolog at Oxford . That eventu led to a doctor program after he spent some time in graduat school in the Unit State .The current project began when he becam fed up with the lack of ancient DNA evid in paper about the origin of dog . He call Dr. Dobney , of the Univers of Aberdeen in 2011 , and said , Wer do dogs.After receiv the grant from the council in England , he and Dr. Dobney organ a confer in Aberdeen , Scotland , to gather as mani peopl involv in research dog origin as they could . Hi pitch to the group wa that despit their differ point of view , everyon wa interest in the best possibl evid , no matter where it led .If we have to eat crow , we eat crow ,  he said . It science.Mietj Germonpr , a paleontologist at the Royal Belgian Institut of Natur Scienc , is one of the mani scientist particip in the dog project . She wa one of a number of author on a 2013 paper in Scienc that identifi a skull about 32,000 year old from a Belgian cave in Goyet as an earli dog . Dr. Wayn at U.C.L.A . wa the senior author on the paper and Olaf Thalmann from the Univers of Turku in Finland wa the first author .It is typic of Dr. Larson dog project that although he disagre with the find of the paper , argu that the evid just wasnt there to call the Goyet skull a dog , all of the author of the paper are work on the larger project with him .In Novemb in Brussel , hold the priceless fossil , Dr. Germonpr point out the wide skull , crowd teeth and short snout of the ancient skull  all indic to her that it wa not a wolf .To me , it a dog ,  she said . Studi of mitochondri DNA , pass down from femal onli , also indic the skull wa not a wolf , accord to the 2013 paper .Dr. Germonpr said she think dog were domest some time befor thi anim die , and she lean toward the idea that human intent bred them from wolv .She hold up anoth piec of evid , a reconstruct of a 30,000-year-old canid skull found near Predmost , in the Czech Republ , with a bone in it mouth . She report in 2014 that thi wa a dog . And she say the bone is part of evid the anim wa buri with care . We think it wa deliber put there ,  she said .But she recogn these claim are controversi and is will , like the rest of the world of canin scienc , to risk damag to the fossil themselv to get more inform on not just the mitochondri DNA but also the nuclear DNA .To minim that risk , she talk with Ardern Hulme-Beaman , a postdoctor research with the Oxford team , about where to cut into it . He wa near the end of month of travel to Russia , Turkey , the Unit State and all over Europ to take sampl of canid jaw and skull .He and Allowen Evin , now with the Nation Center for Scientif Research in Montpelli , Franc , also took mani photograph of each jaw and skull to do geometr morphometr . Softwar process detail photograph from everi angl into 3-D recreat that provid much more inform on the shape of a bone than length and width measur .Dr. Germonpr and Dr. Hulme-Beaman agre on a spot in the interior of the skull to cut . In the laboratori , he use a small electr drill with a cut blade to remov a chunk the size of a bit of chop walnut . An acrid , burn smell indic that organ materi wa intact within the bone  a good sign for the potenti retriev of DNA .Back in Oxford , research will attempt to use the most current techniqu to get as much DNA as possibl out of the sampl . There is no stretch of code that say wolf or dog ,  ani more than there is a singl skull featur that defin a categori . What geneticist tri to establish is how differ the DNA of one anim is from anoth . Ad ancient DNA give mani more point of refer over a long time span .Dr. Larson hope that he and hi collabor will be abl to identifi a section of DNA in some ancient wolv that wa pass on to more doglik descend and eventu to modern dog . And he hope they will be abl to identifi chang in the skull or jaw of those wolv that show shift to more doglik shape , help to narrow the origin of domest .The usual assumpt about domest anim is that the process of tame and breed them happen onc . But that not necessarili so . Dr. Larson and Dr. Dobney show that pig were domest twice , onc in Anatolia and onc in China . The same could be true of dog .Although the gather of old bone is almost done , Dr. Larson is still negoti with Chines research for sampl from that part of the world , which he say are necessari . But he hope they will come .If all goe well , said Dr. Larson , the project will publish a flagship paper from all of the particip describ their gener find . And over the next coupl of year , research , all use the common data , will continu to publish separ find .Other larg collabor effort are brew , as well . Dr. Wayn , at U.C.L.A. , said that a group in China wa form with the goal of sequenc 10,000 dog genom . He and Dr. Larson are part of that group .Last fall , Dr. Larson wa becom more excit with each new bit of data , but not yet readi to tip hi hand about what conclus the data may warrant , or how signific they will be .But he is grow increasingli confid that they will find what they want , and come close to settl the thorni question of when and where the tear power of a wolf jaw first gave way to the persuas forc of a nudg from a dog cold nose .Im start to drink my own Kool-Aid ,  he said .\", 'Chicken get no respect . Ask ani chicken research .When the Art and Human Research Council of Great Britain decid to give about $ 3 million to a number of academ figur , includ Greger Larson , to studi the Cultur & Scientif Percept of Human-Chicken Interact ,  the grant caught the eye of someon at The Daili Mail , in England .A Birdbrain Idea ?  , read the headlin over an articl that contrast cut in entir unrel social servic with what wa portray as a silli windfal of chicken money .Dr. Larson , a professor at Oxford , who is also overse a major project on dog evolut , did not laugh .As he note recent , the stagger number of chicken in the world  20 billion or so  is reason enough to studi them . And although it may be hard to believ , it seem that neither potpi nor chicken Parmesan wa the reason human domest them .It look like from all the evid that chicken exist for a veri long time in associ with peopl and they were not food ,  he said .Today , chicken are just behind pig and pois to overtak them as the most common sourc of anim protein in the world . But befor the rais of chicken becam industri , they were far less import to human diet , and for thousand of year , their primari role seem to have been in cockfight or variou ritual . Estim of the time of their domest are from 7,000 to 10,000 year ago , but a recent report from an archaeolog dig in Israel conclud that they were first eaten in signific number about 2,200 year ago .The chicken project will investig , among other thing , just exactli what we were do with chicken for all that time .Along the way , it may answer some seldom ask question , Dr. Larson said , like , How do chicken get associ with Easter ? Dr. Larson interest is larg in genet and biolog evolut , but domest is evolut run by human , so question about what they want from the anim and whi they domest them are import . And it easi to think peopl in the past had the same attitud of peopl now .But chicken , he said , offer an excel exampl of how wrong that assumpt can be .For instanc , in an excav of a villag in Austria , where peopl live in the earli Middl Age , around the sixth to eighth centuri , archaeologist found peopl buri with their chicken and other good . The cockerel were buri with men and the hen with women . And the cock buri with the high-statu men had longer fight spur than the chicken buri with poorer men .And studi of carbon and nitrogen in the bone of peopl and chicken suggest that chicken and peopl had been share a veri similar environ and diet . Appar , chicken were live near peopl , not off in coop somewher .The way we interact with chicken now and the way we interact with ani of our domest anim is a radic departur from the way that human have interact with anim over the last 15,000 year ,  Dr. Larson said .Understand that give us a much better insight not onli into what wev had but what wev lost.He ha also come to realiz that humor is anoth way human connect to chicken , or at least to the idea of chicken .When the chicken project recent present a night of chicken humor at a pub in London , call Whi did the chicken ... ?  , Dr. Larson join in .The onlin descript of the program may have broken new scholarli ground by note a fact not often address in the volumin scientif literatur on Gallu gallu : Chicken are funny.', 'Kaleigh Clari , a comput scienc graduat student at the Univers of Massachusett Amherst , drove down to offer a day of free work for the American Museum of Natur Histori .Whi ?Dinosaur , man ,  Ms. Clari said .Comput programm , it appear , like dinosaur , a lot .She wa one of almost 150 peopl who gather for the museum Hack the Dinos challeng in Novemb to creat softwar tool to help dinosaur scientist .Like mani field of scienc , paleontolog is now awash in data . Paleontologist no longer just look at and describ fossil . They also put the bone in CT scanner , gener gigabyt of imag and data . That open up new research like reconstruct the size and shape of the brain of dinosaur and compar them with those of modern bird , which descend from dinosaur .That analysi can be excruciatingli labori . For each X-ray slice of the skull , a scientist typic ha to trace the outlin of the interior space .

The museum put out a challeng look for help a a way to volunt ,  said Christina Wallac , one of the hackathon organ . It a pro bono challenge.Winner receiv one-year membership to the museum and three-dimension print bust of Theodor Roosevelt . More importantli , theyll get brag right for the next 12 month ,  Ms. Wallac said .Hack the Dinos wa the museum second hackathon . A year earlier , the challeng wa Hack the Univers ,  to crunch through astronomi data .The museum paleontologist brainstorm for month about digit tool that they wish exist .Autom skull analysi wa one item on the wish list . Other includ modern the vener field notebook to the age of smartphon and convert cladogram  the famili tree that show the evolutionari relationship among speci  to digit format . ( Nowaday , paleontologist produc digit file that are easili share and compar , but there are mani more from earlier year that exist onli on paper . )The paleontologist also hope to eas the workload of Carl Mehl , the museum staff member who repli when someon send in a photograph with the question , I thi a fossil ? Thi is do good ,  said one of the particip , Peter Lenz , who work at the Dstilleri , a New York compani that take a data scienc approach to market and brand . Your do it becaus you like dinosaurs.The programm , graphic design and data scientist met on a Friday night to divid into team and quiz paleontologist about the problem and data . They began hack the next afternoon .After the museum close , some team spread out among the quiet , empti dinosaur hall . I realli just want to stay overnight in the museum ,  said Jessi Contour , who is work on a master of fine art degre at Parson School of Design .At 11:30 p.m. , there wa a danc parti , although most particip remain sit at their laptop . Now if anyon get deep vein thrombosi , it not my fault ,  Ms. Wallac joke .Later , museum volunt set out cot for particip .There wa a mous that kept me compani all night ,  said Gabriela Gutierrez , anoth particip . Thank god for the cots.In the morn , Ms. Wallac walk around blast Taylor Swift music from a phone to wake everyon for a few more hour of work .I would be asham at the state of the code ,  Mr. Lenz said . But for 22 hour without sleep , it realli great.On Sunday afternoon , the team present what they had produc .Ms. Contour wa a member of a team that creat a smartphon app , Fossl , to help Mr. Mehl .

It solv the problem we were tri to solve.', 'A 53-year-old woman on Medicaid in Washington State who ha never had a mammogram elect to get one in return for a $ 15 gift card .A 35-year-old woman in Florida choos to get her first mammogram becaus her insur , Aetna , offer a $ 50 payrol check .In Iowa , a 46-year-old woman who ha been get mammogram everi other year opt to get them annual becaus Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield will pay her $ 50 to do so .All three of these women have averag risk profil , and none have famili member with breast cancer . Who made the right choic ?It a trick question . The real question is whether employ and health plan should realli be offer incent to women to get frequent mammogram .Women hear all the time that mammographi save live ,  a messag the American Colleg of Radiolog and variou breast cancer chariti have been repeat for year . But the advic doe not appli to all women  at least it shouldnt .Just last week , the Unit State Prevent Servic Task Forc again recommend that women at averag risk for breast cancer begin get regular mammogram at age 50 , and then everi other year until age 74 . The American Cancer Societi recommend yearli mammographi from age 45 to 54 , then screen everi other year afterward .Other group hew to still other posit , although all acknowledg that women must be abl to choos for themselv when to start . The divers of opinion is entir understand . The data is anyth but clear , and that rais tough question about whether incent to get screen are appropri .We do know that regular screen reduc the chanc of die from breast cancer , but the reduct seem to be small . For all death avert , accord to the task forc , at least twice as mani women will have receiv entir unnecessari treatment and the anxieti that come with it .In truth , estim of the benefit and harm of screen are all over the map ; research themselv do not agre on the fact .The task forc ha taken a middl road through the thicket , estim that screen 1,000 women from age 50 everi two year for 20 year will avert seven death from breast cancer . All that mammographi also could lead to 953 fals alarm , the task forc say , in which women are wrongli identifi as have cancer but given correct inform befor treatment .Nineteen of the 1,000 women eventu may be overdiagnos : Screen will detect cell abnorm that will be classifi as cancer but would never have led to health problem , let alon death . While a few screen women would benefit by have a lethal tumor detect , mani more would go on to have unnecessari mastectomi , chemotherapi and other treatment .True , the more women screen , the more breast cancer death avert . And perhap in principl , everi avert death should be celebr . But that still doe not mean that we should embrac everi method that increas screen rate .How widespread is the practic of incentiv mammogram ? It is hard to know . Unfortun , there is no requir that these incent be report , and plan benefit are not typic public . In a brief onlin search , I found 17 current and recent program by major employ and health plan . Incent rang from $ 10 to $ 250 , possibl a signific induc to lower-incom women .In choos among compet guidelin , women are be ask to strike a delic balanc . The trade-off are complex , and depend on person valu , like how comfort with risk you are . Employ and health plan incent suggest that mammogram are inher worthwhil and risk gloss over these nuanc .Thi complic weigh of pro and con should not be sidestep by simpli pay women to have mammogram . Instead , employ and health plan should offer incent that reward the use of evidence-bas decis aid .In short : Dont pay women to get mammogram  pay them to use a tool to decid whether they should get mammogram .Onlin decis aid are base on the best avail scientif evid , typic robust random control trial . The user is gener guid through sever screen offer inform on all ethic relev benefit and harm , and is thu ask to identifi prefer and weigh the option .Regrett , such tool are not offer univers by health plan and employ . Nor can they be found on the most obviou websit that women might turn to , such as the What Is a Mammogram and When Should I Get One ?  page offer by the Center for Diseas Control and Prevent or the Mammographi Facts offer on the American Colleg of Radiolog site .Such a tool might well have suggest that two of our hypothet women reconsid the choic to be screen  the two younger one . Financi incent for get mammogram are doubtless well intend . But it would be far more ethic to use incent to encourag women to make decis inform by evid .', 'Climat chang may affect wood rat in the Mojav Desert in a most unusu way . A new studi find that warmer weather reduc their abil to toler toxin in the creosot bush , which they reli on for susten .The consequ may be dire for the wood rat .

Although high in the Mojav can reach the 80 and 90 dure the summer , much of the year is cooler . The rat becam less toler of the toxin and began to lose weight .The reason may have to do with how the liver function in warmer weather , Ms. Kurnath said .The liver is the body primari detoxifi organ . When a mammalian liver is activ , it increas intern bodi temperatur .In warmer weather , mayb your not produc huge amount of heat and your not break down the toxin ,  Ms. Kurnath said .As the climat warm , the wood rat will disappear from the Mojav or , if they are fortun , adapt , Ms. Kurnath said .', 'Male zebra finch learn their courtship song from their father .

They have been die for month , but estim of the toll jump sharpli when David Iron , a retir Unit State Fish and Wildlif Servic biologist walk a beach in Whittier , Alaska , found close to 8,000 dead bird in earli Januari .Sinc then , scout team in boat from Fish and Wildlif , the Unit State Geolog Survey and the Princ William Sound Scienc Center count anoth 10,000 to 12,000 dead murr on beach and in the open water of Princ William Sound , said Kathi Kuletz , a seabird specialist for the Alaska region with the Fish and Wildlif Servic .As with most die-off , theori are close at hand . Murr weigh about two pound and live in larg group , dive to feed on fish like juvenil pollock . In winter , they usual gather near the continent shelf , and they need to eat a lot to keep go , up to half their bodi weight in a day .There are more than two million of them in Alaskan water alon . But last year wa not good for them .The bird are emaci and seem to be starv , accord to the Nation Wildlif Health Center in Wisconsin , which ha found no evid of diseas or toxin that could caus such death .When there are chang in water temperatur , as ha been occur in the Northeast Pacif , food fish may disappear .Still , thi die-off ha surpris expert , becaus it ha been go on for around a year and it cover such a vast area .Most die-off in the past have been more concentr in time and space , said John F.

If histori is ani guid , El Nio mean troubl to murr .I still dont think wev seen the worst ,  said Dr. Piatt , who said it wa like that 100,000 or more bird had die and specul that if the worst happen , the death could reach into the mani hundr of thousand .A tougher question for research is tri to understand how one popul crash fit in with die-off of other anim and whether die-off have been increas in recent year .Certainli , there are remark recent event , like the death of half of all saiga antelop last year . And moos , bee and dolphin off the East Coast have also had die-off in recent year .Samuel Fey , a research in biolog at Yale Univers , wa move by news media attent of die-off to research whether they were realli increas over time . These individu event garner so much attent ,  he said . They have shock and awe value.So he and Stephani Carlson , a specialist in environment scienc at the Univers of California , Berkeley , and a group of other research put togeth a databas of more than 700 such event worldwid in 2,400 anim popul date to the late 19th centuri .Their analysi , publish a year ago , show that the magnitud of die-off sinc about 1940 had increas . But in term of frequenc , all they could say wa that report of die-off were certainli increas .They could not say whether the report repres a real increas or just increas attent becaus , as Dr. Fey said last week after report of the murr death , there is no central databas of big die-off of bird , fish , frog and other anim .He is , howev , work to remedi thi with Dr. Juli Lenoch , a veterinarian and deputi director of the Nation Wildlif Health Center of the geolog survey in Madison , Wi .The center doe necropsi on wild anim sent to it by agenc like Fish and Wildlif and keep track of what it find . But , Dr. Lenoch said , We onli test sampl we receive.And becaus that is their onli len on the phenomenon of die-off , they are handicap in tri to answer bigger question .Understand both the caus and consequ of anim die-off is critic import ,  she said , becaus diseas may be involv , like rabi , West Nile or avian influenza , that could spread to farm anim , domest anim or human . Toxic chemic may be a caus , and those can affect other anim and human .Or chang in climat or weather may be involv , and recogn pattern could help prepar for futur event and understand natur system better .Some databas exist now . The Nation Ocean and Atmospher Administr ha one for ocean wildlif . And the geolog survey ha a histor databas of anim die-off call Whisper that went onlin about a year ago .

From 1984 to 1985 , he said , 95 percent of the common murr in the Barent Sea off Russia and Norway disappear , appar becaus of overfish of capelin . Today , there are more of them there than ever .On the other hand , when murr near the Farallon Island off California had a popul crash in 1983 , some coloni almost vanish , and popul growth wa veri slow after the die-off .Murr can rebound ,  Dr. Piatt said , but sometim , they dont.', 'Q .

But the firm settl becaus we came to the realiz that the most import thing we could do is focu on the futur ,  Mr. Berkowitz said .Even scientist who see promis in cognit train applaud the agency action . The critic were right ,  said Joel Sneed , a psychologist at Queen Colleg and senior author of a meta-analysi on cognit train and depress .The field is far , far , far from demonstr ani reduct or delay in cognit declin ,  Dr. Sneed said .Broader question of whether cognit train work , and for whom , still gener consider debat , given that human brain chang and grow throughout life , a qualiti call neuroplasticity.There is no evid that spend 10 or 15 minut sever time a week at your keyboard , dispatch anim train to appropri color station or recal the locat of squar on a grid , will spare you dementia . Claim that it will improv your work or your child school perform remain similarli unproven .Last fall , more than 70 psychologist and neuroscientist sign a statement circul by the Stanford Center on Longev . We object to the claim that brain game offer consum a scientif ground avenu to reduc or revers cognit declin when there is no compel scientif evid to date that they do ,  the statement said , though it encourag further research .A group of about 100 scientist and expert counter with their own open letter .Agre that mani compani had made exagger claim , these research nevertheless argu that a substanti and grow bodi of evid show that certain cognit train regimen can significantli improv cognit function.Georg Rebok , a development psychologist at John Hopkin , sign the second letter , concern that the Stanford statement dismiss year of research . It would almost chill the whole field if peopl conclud it wa all bogu ,  Dr. Rebok said .Hundr of publish studi have examin cognit train , but mani involv veri small group of subject and design that might have encourag a placebo effect by compar inact control group , who do noth , with particip who becom invest in and motiv by their train effort .Critic have point out , too , that the cognit test use to assess participants progress are often so similar to the train game that investig may be teach to the test. They also question self-report assess of the result .What scientist call transfer ,  real-world result beyond the laboratori , lie at the heart of the debat .When they train on these game for 15 or 20 session , peopl get better  on these game ,  said Thoma Redick , a psychologist at Purdu Univers . Improv often show up between pre- and post-test of cognit , too  an exampl of near transfer ,  the abil to do better , with practic , on similar task .But what about far transfer ,  affect participants abil to function in their daili live ? Doe cognit train help peopl handl their financ or rememb where they park ?Probabl the largest studi in the field with the longest follow-up , call Activ , doe suggest that endur effect are possibl .It 2,832 cognit normal volunt ( averag age , nearli 74 ) met in small group with facilit for 10 session of train on one of three skill : memori , process speed or reason .Ten year later , test show that the subject train in process speed and reason still outperform the control group , though the peopl given memori train no longer did . And 60 percent of the train particip , compar with 50 percent of the control group , said they had maintain or improv their abil to manag daili activ like shop and financ .They felt the train had made a differ ,  said Dr. Rebok , who wa a princip investig .So that far transfer  or is it ? When the investig administ test that mimick real-lif activ , like manag medic , the differ between the traine and the control group particip no longer reach statist signific .A secondari analysi also found that after five year , peopl who had been train were no less like than those in the control group to develop dementia .In subject 18 to 30 year old , Dr. Redick also found limit transfer after comput train to improv work memori .Ask whether they thought they had improv , nearli all the particip said ye  and most had , on the train exercis themselv . They did no better , howev , on test of intellig , multitask and other cognit abil .Im pretti skeptic ,  Dr. Redick said of current computer cognit train . The evid is pretti clear that it not a good approach for caus the chang we care about.Still , cognit train may have potenti , some investig say . Mayb the program need to more close simul real-lif challeng ; perhap the dosag  how much peopl train  matter .Dr. P.

As cell in our bodi die , they cast off fragment of gene , some of which end up in the bloodstream , saliva and urin .Cell-fre DNA is like a messag in a bottl , deliv secret about what happen insid our bodi . Pregnant women , for exampl , carri cell-fre DNA from their fetus . A test that analyz fetal DNA ha prove to be more accur in screen for Down syndrom than standard blood test .In 2012 , Jay Shendur , a geneticist at the Univers of Washington , and hi colleagu were abl to reconstruct the entir genom of a fetu from cell-fre DNA in a pregnant woman saliva . A team of Stanford Univers research collect DNA fragment from the blood of patient who had receiv heart transplant and manag to find DNA from their donat heart . ( Tellingli , level were highest in patient who were reject their heart . )These day , scientist are especi excit by the prospect of use cell-fre DNA to test for cancer . Instead of reli on invas biopsi , they hope to find blood-born fragment that carri distinct cancer mutat .Unfortun , the genet sequenc of a piec of cell-fre DNA doesnt tell research where in the bodi it origin  a valuabl clue for doctor look for diseas . Know the origin of circul DNA is of great import ,  said Alain R. Thierri , director of research at France Nation Institut of Health and Medic Research .All the cell in our bodi typic descend from a singl fertil egg , and they inherit all the same gene . The reason we arent uniform sac of protoplasm is that our cell turn those same gene on and off in distinct pattern , therebi develop into differ tissu . Theyr like musician at a piano recit : They sit at the same keyboard , but they play differ song .But in a studi publish on Thursday in the journal Cell , Dr. Shendur and hi colleagu took some import step toward identifi the origin of free-float DNA . To do so , they took advantag of a way that cell control their gene .DNA is wound around million of protein cluster , resembl bead on a string . Some gene sit on stretch of DNA unencumb by these cluster , call nucleosom , but other gene are tuck deep insid them . By hide gene , nucleosom can silenc them .As it turn out , differ type of cell squirrel away differ stretch of DNA in nucleosom . One of Dr. Shendure graduat student , Matthew W. Snyder , wonder what happen to those nucleosom in die cell .A cell end it use life is shred by enzym . But nucleosom , Mr. Snyder suggest , might shield the DNA theyv hidden .If so , then much of the cell-fre DNA that scientist collect from blood sampl should have come from nucleosom . They could reveal the pattern of nucleosom in the cell they came from  and thu tell research which kind of cell produc it .Mr. Snyder and hi colleagu put the idea to the test . They search the blood of healthi individu for cell-fre DNA , and then search a map of the human genom to figur out where each fragment came from . Much of the cell-fre DNA came from region in or around nucleosom , just as Mr. Snyder had suggest .The scientist then look at the pattern of nucleosom in differ type of cell . They found that all the healthi subject produc cell-fre DNA that mainli came from nucleosom found in blood cell .But when they look at cell-fre DNA from peopl with advanc cancer , the pictur wa differ .In a patient with lung cancer , for exampl , the team found that the cell-fre DNA fit a differ pattern  one belong to a type of lung cancer cell . The research went on to match cell-fre DNA in other cancer patient to the type of cancer they had .Dr. Thierri , who wa not involv in the research , said the find might eventu make it possibl to use cell-fre DNA to find import clue about diseas .

That a question that group of scientist from Japan , the U.S. and Russia will have to decid as they replac the current identifi of four element  113 , 115 , 117 and 118  with someth a littl more evoc .With the usher in of these four superheavi element , and the approv of the Intern Union of Pure and Appli Chemistri , the Period Table seventh row will be complet .Though the research have yet to put forth their suggest , ton of idea are alreadi float around scienc circl . One onlin petit aim to name heavi metal 115 lemmium after the deceas Motrhead frontman Ian Lemmy Kilmist , and ha alreadi reach more than 145,000 signatur as of Wednesday afternoon . Anoth , with more than 44,000 signatur , want to name element 117 octarine after the late Terri Pratchett and hi Discworld book seri .We recent solicit reader suggest .

Donald Trump is shake up thi contest , too  reader suggest trumpium ,  trumpillium ,  trumpissum and AnyoneButTrumpium.Here are some other standout :The most popular suggest we receiv wa to name element 113 after Riken institut in Japan . The team of scientist from the institut were the first research in Asia to discov an element and gain the right to name it . But Rikenium doe not follow the rule set out by the Intern Union of Pure and Appli Chemistri , which ultim must approv the win name ( Riken is an institut , not a place , and therefor would most like be disqualifi as a contend ) .David Bernklau , a reader from Brooklyn , suggest name one of the new element after Albert Ghiorso , who codiscov an astonish 12 element , a record . Over the cours of 30 year , hi invent contribut to the discoveri of americium , curium , berkelium , californium , einsteinium , fermium , mendelevium , nobelium , lawrencium , rutherfordium , dubnium and seaborgium . Seaborgium wa name after hi colleagu Glenn Seaborg , a nuclear scientist .In a nutshel , it is unbeliev that an element ha yet to be name after him !  said Mr. Bernklau .Sever peopl suggest name one of the new element after the 300-foot-tal mutant lizard .Godzillium ,  Susan Sampson wrote , i mythic , Japanes , and worthi of an element that is unnatur , radioact and rapidli self-destructive.Thi popular suggest come from a Japanes word for Japan , Nippon. Thi name actual isnt a newcom to the period tabl . In 1908 , Japanes chemist Masataka Ogawa ascrib nipponium , with the symbol Np , to what he thought wa element 43 .It appear in period tabl in Britain , accord to the book The Lost Elements. But other scientist were unabl to isol the element . Later analysi of Dr. Ogawa sampl in 1930 show that Dr. Ogawa had actual found element 75 , which is just one row directli below element 43 . Unfortun by the time research realiz the mistak it wa too late : element 75 had alreadi been name rhenium in 1925 . Dr. Ogawa die a few week after learn the fate of nipponium .Element 43 wa later found and name technetium in 1937 and the symbol Np wa use to describ neptunium in 1940 .Lisa DeBeneditti said she would bestow the name sisyphisium on element 118 becaus it is the heaviest synthet element . Her logic :The credit for discov element 118  the heaviest ever creat  ha been assign to the Dubna and Lawrenc Livermor team . The element ha a checker histori : a 1999 claim to have made it wa retract two year later amid accus that data had been falsified.Therefor , I look to two attribut : it heavi and it second appear , as noteworthi . Like the heavi boulder that Sisyphu wa condemn to push up a mountain , onli to watch it roll down , for etern , thi name evok 118 emblemat characteristics.Holli Trieb also decid to borrow a name from Greek mytholog for her suggest name . She went with narcissium after the handsom hunter , Narcissu , who upon look into a pool of water , fell deepli in love with hi reflect and stare at it until he die .Thi word suit ani of the newfound element becaus they are all man-mad element , and scientist have begun to play God in thi aspect . They decid what is creat and what they believ is necessari ,  she said . It is a form of self-import becaus the element present on Earth are no longer good enough.', 'Pictur a volcano .

Now imagin that thi line is so long that it run for more than 40,000 mile through the dark recess of all the world ocean , gird the globe like the seam of a basebal .Welcom to one of the planet most obscur but import featur , known rather prosaic as the midocean ridg . Though long enough to circl the moon more than six time , they receiv littl notic becaus they lie hidden in pitch dark . Oceanograph stumbl on their volcan natur in 1973 . Ever sinc , costli expedit have slowli explor the undersea world , which typic lie more than a mile down .The result can make the vision of Jule Vern seem rather tame .The ridg featur long rift valley and , down their middl , giant field of gush hot spring that shed ton of miner into ici seawat , slowli build eeri mound and tower that can be rich in metal like gold and silver . One knobbi tower in the Pacif Ocean , nicknam Godzilla , grew 15 stori high . Thicket of snakelik tubeworm and other bizarr creatur often blanket the hot featur , as do hungri prowler such as spider crab .The riot of life coexist with spring hot enough to melt lead or the plastic window of mini submarin . With extrem care , human and robot have measur temperatur as high as 780 degre .To date , the studi have been episod . Ridg expedit ventur out fit , their schedul determin by fickl weather and budget , not to mention the vagari of crew and gear avail .Now , scientist have inaugur a major new effort . Off the West Coast , they have wire up a highli activ ridg with hundr of sensor and camera , as well as cabl that flash the read to shore . The ocean observatori is to oper for at least a quarter centuri , replac sporad glimps with continu scrutini .Thi month , the surg of data is hit the Internet . Hundr of scientist around the globe will now be abl to monitor one of Earth most restless and enigmat featur as effortlessli as read their email .Wer see it come aliv ,  said Maya Tolstoy , a marin geophysicist at the Lamont-Doherti Earth Observatori of Columbia Univers . She recent got a preview that includ an erupt . It excit ,  she ad . Wer just start to understand what go on.John R. Delaney , an oceanograph at the Univers of Washington who conceiv of the observatori decad ago , said it would help scientist better grasp not onli the volcan ridg but the surround water , which cover most of the planet .Suddenli , a technolog door ha open on studi the ocean from within ,  he said in an interview . The new perspect , he ad , i the onli way wer ever go to understand it true complex  the hundr of processes.A main question is to what extent the volcan chang over time . The old idea wa that the erupt of ooz lava and relat activ occur at fairli steadi rate . Now , studi hint at the exist of outburst larg enough to influenc not onli the charact of the global sea but the planet temperatur .Expert believ the activ may carri major repercuss becaus the ocean ridg account for some 70 percent of the planet volcan erupt . By definit , that make them enorm sourc of heat and exot miner as well as such everyday gase as carbon dioxid , which all volcano emit .It a whole new perspect on how the Earth work ,  said Daniel J. Fornari , a senior scientist at the Wood Hole Oceanograph Institut on Cape Cod , Mass . Wev got our eye and ear on a part of the seafloor that realli dynamic.The sourc of all of thi activ is the slow churn of Earth molten interior , which continu rearrang the planet two dozen or so larg crustal plate . The volcan ridg mark the place where ocean slab slowli pull apart , give molten rock and gase an escap rout .The first volcan hint came to light in 1973 when mini submarin dive on the mid-Atlant Ridg . It run for nearli 10,000 mile , make it the planet longest mountain chain . The French-American team expect to see the rocki fold and fissur typic of region on land where plate pull apart , known as diverg boundari . Instead , they found bed of harden lava .The excit rose in 1977 when an American submers off the Galpago Island dive to a deep ridg . Over a hydrophon , from the seab , a puzzl scientist told the mother ship that the volcan site bore abund life  contrari to the usual desertlik portray of the deep sea .There all these anim down here ,  the expert report . The unexpect fauna includ red shrimp , brown mussel , pink fish with undul tail , and dens stand of tubeworm with bright red plume .In the 1980 , scientist found that the hot vent could discharg giant plume of warm , buoyant water . Zooplankton  cloud of tini sea creatur  turn out to flourish in the mineral-rich plume . The track of whale call suggest that the giant mammal fed on the dens swarm .Last year , a more basic discoveri came to light . A team of 11 scientist report that the blister hot spring act as global recycl center that turn complex carbon from age of deceas ocean life into much simpler chemic that can form new organ .They replac it with materi that biolog reactiv ,  said Jeffrey A. Hawk , a marin chemist at the Univers of Oldenburg in Germani , who led the research . Theyr the lifeblood of the deep sea.Start in the 1990 , oceanograph receiv a glimps of what continu monitor had to offer when the Navi share it long-secret network of undersea microphon , use dure the Cold War to track enemi submarin . Suddenli , marin scientist could hear the volcan erupt and studi their aftermath .Recent , Dr. Tolstoy of Columbia Univers drew on such acoust data from nine seab erupt over nearli two decad to paint a group portrait full of surpris . It turn out that all of those erupt , from the Pacif , Atlant and Arctic Ocean , took place from Januari to June .The caus , she propos , is Earth slightli ellipt orbit around the sun . That chang the strength of the sun gravit pull on Earth dure the year and , as a result , the magnitud of the tide that squeez the planet . She said the erupt coincid with the annual letup of the squeez . More boldli , Dr. Tolstoy suggest that such mechan might help explain how the planet regular ice age end so abruptli  long a mysteri .Ocean level fall sharpli in such bitterli cold period as water is tie up in massiv continent ice sheet . In a paper , she propos that the reduc pressur on the ridg might let them erupt far more frequent . As a result , more carbon dioxid would spew into the ocean and , eventu , into the atmospher , trap more heat and warm the planet .In short , accord to thi hypothesi , the ice sheet would eventu grow larg enough to initi their own destruct , refil the ocean . It wa a radic idea that ha stir debat .In an interview , Dr. Tolstoy said mount evid from the seab suggest that the volcan ridg were exquisit sensitive to slight chang in stress , make them open to a varieti of celesti influenc . Scientist say such factor might one day enhanc their understand of whi Earth climat ha vari so markedli over the age , improv their comput model and forecast .The undersea observatori , by scrutin hundr of ridg featur , promis to help scientist address such riddl .It sit atop the Juan de Fuca Ridg . The volcan spread center  more than 300 mile long  lie in a slant line off the West Coast , from British Columbia to Oregon . The observatori is divid into two part . Canada oper the northern one and the Unit State the southern one , part of a larger program known as the Ocean Observatori Initi .All told , it cost roughli $ 500 million  far less than the next gener of optic telescop under construct around the globe . The Nation Scienc Foundat , the feder government big funder of basic scienc , paid for the American part .Togeth , the two site featur more than 1,000 mile of cabl , dozen of junction box and hundr of sensor .Instrument on the seab includ tilt meter , camera , seismomet , temperatur gaug , hydrophon , chemic probe , pressur sensor and fluid sampler . Also , mobil platform crawl up and down long moor to take read higher in the water column . The observatory main cabl run ashor at Port Alberni , on Vancouv Island , and Pacif Citi , Ore .We have the most advanc cabl observatori on ani volcano in the world ocean ,  said Deborah S. Kelley , a scientist at the Univers of Washington who direct the American segment . Therel be lot of discoveries.Dr. Kelley join Dr. Fornari of Wood Hole and three other marin scientist to compil a photograph atla that summar what scientist have learn so far about the hidden world .Discov the Deep ,  publish in May by Cambridg Univers Press , is fill with hundr of imag of alien creatur as well as volcan tower belch cloud of superh water rich in metal and miner . It profil more than a dozen hot spot around the globe , includ those on the Juan de Fuca Ridg , home to Godzilla . Oceanograph , the book say , have discov vast swarm of unusu sturdi microb thrive in dark volcan water as hot as 250 degre  hotter than most boil water on land .Look to the futur , the author describ the observatori and it import for see the ocean from within .

It will never soar into the wild blue yonder , but the dusti Peterbilt truck park outsid a hangar at NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center here may repres the futur of low-carbon aviat .Perch on steel support behind the truck cab is a 30-foot airplan wing , the kind found on a small plane . Instead of a fossil-fuel-burn engin or two , howev , the wing is outfit with 18 electr motor along it lead edg , each with a small red propel .The truck-plan mash-up , a NASA project call LeapTech , is meant to test a new approach to power flight . Technician and engin have been drive the truck down a dri lake-b runway at thi desert base at more than 70 mile per hour , the battery-pow propel spin as if a takeoff were immin .Wer abl to simul full takeoff and land configur and measur lift , drag , motor effici and aerodynam perform ,  said Sean Clark , an engin and a princip investig on the project .The concept , call distribut propuls , is one of sever be studi here and at other research center to develop technolog that could lead to complet new and far less pollut aircraft design . Futur plane may be power by batteri or hybrid gas-electr system , for instanc , and have lighter wing that can quickli chang shape to better handl the stress brought on by turbul air . Other may elimin the convent wings-and-fuselag design in favor of one that blend the two element , all to further the caus of lower emiss .Commerci aviat account for about 2 percent of the global total of carbon dioxid emit annual by human activ , or a littl less than is produc by Germani . Although manufactur and airlin have made air travel far more effici  the Air Transport Action Group , an industri organ , estim that emiss per seat-mil are down 70 percent from the 1960 , when jet began oper  the industry tremend growth ha result in higher total emiss .That growth show no sign of stop . The Intern Civil Aviat Organ , the Unit Nation agenc that overse the industri , forecast that the worldwid commerci fleet will doubl , to about 40,000 airlin , in the next 15 year . And a recent European Commiss report note that as countri and other industri rein in their emiss , aviat could eventu be respons for more than one-fifth of the global total .Although aviat wa left out of the climat agreement adopt in Pari last month  that omiss ha some environmentalist question just how historic the accord actual wa  reduc emiss remain a prioriti for the I.C.A.O. , a spokesman said . Among other initi , the agenc is expect to approv certif standard next year that would limit CO2 emiss for new aircraft .In the Unit State , the Environment Protect Agenc earlier thi year move to begin regul greenhous ga emiss from aircraft , although the rule-mak process is expect to be contenti and lengthi .Becaus emiss are directli relat to fuel consumpt , and fuel account for one-third or more of an airline cost , carrier and manufactur continu to make improv . Plane have becom lighter through the use of composit materi , like those that make up about half of the airfram of a Boe 787 . Jet engin have becom more effici . Altern fuel , like biofuel , are start to be use that sharpli cut net carbon emiss . And oper measur like better manag of airplan traffic , both at airport and in the air , have further reduc emiss .Daniel Rutherford , who studi aircraft emiss as a program director at the Intern Council on Clean Transport , a research group , said that improv in fuel consumpt , which have averag a 1.3 percent reduct a year , should continu through the next decad .Effici design flesh out in the 00 when fuel price were high are come to market now ,  he said .Mani of the improv involv chang to exist plane  like ad winglet to wing , which reduc drag and improv effici by a few percentag point , or replac older engin with more effici model . So-cal re-engin , in fact , ha been the biggest singl contributor to improv fuel effici over the long term ,  Dr. Rutherford said .Some aircraft have been partli redesign . Later thi decad , for exampl , Boe will introduc a variant of it 777 model , the 777x , with new composit wing and more effici engin .Further improv can be expect beyond the 2020 , Dr. Rutherford said , depend on how aggress the industri adopt other advanc technolog like open-rotor engin , which improv effici by elimin the shroud that surround most jet engin , and aerodynam modif that smooth the airflow over surfac to reduc drag . ( Boe alreadi use such a system , refer to as hybrid laminar flow control , on the tail of it latest 787 model . )But even with all the improv , actual and potenti , the basic design of an airplan remain the same  a tube and wing . From a basic structur standpoint , a 787 doesnt look a whole lot differ from a 707 ,  said Jay E. Dryer , who direct NASA Advanc Air Vehicl Program .To achiev the drastic emiss reduct that may be requir by the middl of the centuri and beyond  to make aviat as carbon-fre as possibl  new clean sheet aircraft design may be need , incorpor new technolog and approach . That where the Armstrong Flight Research Center come in , develop technolog concept that manufactur may one day use in radic new design .Not far from the LeapTech truck is anoth hangar contain a Gulfstream busi jet that ha been strip bare and wire with hundr of sensor . It is a fli technolog test bed , and is test modif to the trail edg of the wing . Where a flap would normal be , there is instead a continu , bent surfac , which chang the aerodynam characterist of the wing .The concept is still be develop , but the eventu goal would be wing that could morph in respons to real-tim condit . The idea is to ultim replac the entir trail edg of an aircraft wing with technolog like thi , so you could continu chang the shape of the wing to reduc drag and increas lift ,  said Ethan Baumann , chief engin for the test jet . The technolog could also allow the drag and lift forc to be shift around the wing to avoid overload , so the wing could be lighter than convent one .The idea behind distribut propuls is to take the engin from their usual posit hang below the wing and put them elsewher . Because jet engin are complex , heavi devic , distribut propuls design almost alway involv simpler and smaller electr motor .It make a lot of sens to rethink where you put motor when you design a vehicl from scratch ,  Mr. Clark said .In a typic jet turbin engin , a central core burn fuel and air , provid power to turn a fan . That fan draw in more air that bypass the core and exit out the back , produc more thrust . Engin have becom more effici in part by incorpor larger fan to move more of thi bypass air , but there is a limit to how big the fan can get .A distribut design can simpli add more fan , as long as there is enough electr to run them . Now your not constrain by the size of the engin ,  said Panagioti Laskaridi , who research distribut propuls at Cranfield Univers in Britain .Distribut the motor around the plane can also bring aerodynam advantag . With the LeapTech wing , the posit of the motor on the lead edg result in acceler airflow over it , which increas lift at the low speed of takeoff and land . As a result , the wing can be made narrow , which improv effici at cruis speed by reduc drag . An eventu airplan design use distribut propuls may have lead edg motor onli for takeoff and land , and a singl motor at each wingtip that would be use for cruis .LeapTech use batteri to power it motor , but Dr. Laskaridi and a Cranfield colleagu , Devaiah Nalianda , are studi the feasibl of hybrid turbine-electr system that might use batteri and a singl jet engin to gener electr for the motor .At Boe , research are look at sever variant of distribut propuls , said Marti Bradley Sr. , an aerospac engin with the manufactur . They are also studi other advanc concept . These includ truss-brac wing , which would allow longer and thinner and thu more fuel-effici wing , and aft-mount fan , which would speed up the airflow over the fuselag , reduc drag .We have a road map for all of these technolog that could benefit futur airplan ,  Dr. Bradley said , although whether ani of them would be adopt would depend on mani factor .For NASA research , the next step is to modifi an actual aircraft  a four-seat Italian-mad model  to oper on batteri and wing motor .Given the current limit of batteri , the modifi aircraft will onli be abl to make short flight . Batteri technolog may never improv enough to make all-electr plane practic , Mr. Clark said , but a hybrid turbine-batteri design is a realist possibl .I could imagin in 20 year technolog like thi be integr into aircraft ,  he said .Dr. Nalianda said that although there wa much develop work ahead , he had no doubt that the technolog would eventu be use , perhap even for larg aircraft . When the jet engin replac the piston engin in the 1940 and 1950 , it wa veri disrupt ,  he said . I believ distribut propuls is a similar kind of disrupt technology.', 'Q .

Nobodi know about the social live of shark becaus it notori hard to track them.Dr. Brown assembl a team of student and volunt and spent three month at Jervi Bay , on the New South Wale coast , 90 mile south of Sydney , search the water for research subject . Port Jackson shark seem to fit the bill  at about five feet long , they are big enough to spot in the water , and they are plenti . They are probabl the most common shark in Australian water ,  and are rel friendli , Dr. Brown said . If you grab them , they tend to be passiv . Kind of like a pet.Dr. Brown team tag and releas the shark , use a combin of track tool . Passiv integr transpond , or PIT , tag , slightli larger than a grain of rice , hold electron that allow them to act as lifelong bar code that can be detect and read without the anim have to be recaptur . The tag were insert into each shark via a small incis on the animal undersid .An acoust tag attach to the fin of each shark send out a ping each time it come within about a third of a mile of an underwat receiv , or within about 30 feet of anoth tag shark . Each ping is time-stamp , mean it is possibl to detect when a particular shark wa at a particular locat , and whether it came into contact with ani other tag shark there .Dure the initi tag process , Dr. Brown team tag 250 shark in Jervi Bay with both PIT and acoust tag . Last year , 38 more shark were tag . From the data analyz so far , Dr. Brown found that the Port Jackson shark tag four year ago consist return to some locat . At first , it wa thought they were come togeth to breed , but Dr. Brown later discov the shark were of mix age and sex , lead to anoth theori : that the shark like to dine togeth .To rule out the possibl that the anim were attract to the locat itself rather than one anoth , Dr. Brown need an artifici environ in which to observ them up close . So he reach out to a former student , Jo Day , who had studi social interact in bottlenos dolphin and now work as a research and conserv coordin at Taronga Zoo .While Dr. Day wa enthusiast about the possibl of creat a shark habitat there , zoo offici took some convinc the zoo hadnt had a shark exhibit for 25 year .In Septemb , Dr. Brown brought in 10 shark , which immedi took to their new home  a pool 60 feet long , 10 feet deep and 23 feet wide , embellish with a waterfal and rock shelter at the bottom to replic the kind of spot where Port Jackson shark gather in the wild . While the data ha yet to be formal analyz , earli observ back the hypothesi that the shark like be around one anoth .Instead of be spread out around the pool , they are alway togeth ,  Dr. Brown said . Wev seen thi in the wild , too , but here , there no reason theyd be attract to anyth in the shelter , becaus it all artificial.In addit to the PIT and acoust tag , the shark in the pool had acceleromet attach to their dorsal fin , to measur their movement pattern in three dimens . Three camera were set up around the underwat view area , record where the shark swam and what they did . Thi allow the research to match the signatur produc by each shark acceleromet to a particular behavior : swim , rest , eat or mate . Onc a kind of templat is establish , it will be possibl for Dr. Brown and hi team to determin not just where the shark go onc they are releas back in the wild , but also what they are do .These high-tech trap help make the shark experi a hit for the zoo . We alway overhear kid say thing like , Let go see the shark !  Dr. Day said . One keeper talk on the exhibit drew a crowd of around 100 peopl , all squish into thi tini view area . It one of the most popular exhibit on at the zoo right now.The respons also pleas Dr. Brown .The fear of shark is an irrat one ,  he said . It hard to get over an irrat fear . But wer tri to teach peopl that shark arent mindless kill machin , that shark are interest and do interest thing . The realiti is that human kill million of shark everi year . Most shark are under threat from us , not the other way around.Recent , Dr. Brown 3-year-old son visit the zoo with hi preschool class . All he could talk about when he got home wa the shark ,  Dr. Brown recal . I mean , here you have giraff , gorilla and God know what els , and what doe he do ? Talk about the sharks.', 'Two thousand year ago , the ancient Roman introduc public multiseat toilet , hand-wash station , sewag system , aqueduct for drink water , and heat public bath .A new studi find that despit these sanit advanc , Roman of the time suffer just as mani , if not more , parasit and ectoparasit , like lice and flea , as their counterpart in the preced Iron Age .Thi may have been the indirect result of law that requir resid to remov excrement and rubbish from their town , said Pier Mitchel , a paleopathologist at the Univers of Cambridg in Britain and one of the study author .The excrement wa use to fertil crop , and the fece would have contamin the crop ,  he said .

Behind a Lowe home improv store here , scientist are method scrape and sift through a quarri pit that may contain uniqu insight to the mass extinct that elimin the dinosaur .Back then , about 66 million year ago , the ocean were higher , and thi part of southern New Jersey wa a shallow sea , 10 to 15 mile offshor from an ancient mountain rang that rose from the water . Today quarri pit wa onc the sea bottom , and one particular layer about 40 feet beneath the surfac contain a bounti of fossil .Kenneth J. Lacovara , a professor of paleontolog and geolog at nearbi Rowan Univers , call the layer a mass death assemblage. He believ it may be the onli known collect of anim remain that date from the mass extinct itself .It just a hypothesi at the moment , and a tough one to prove . Dr. Lacovara and the univers , which is to complet it purchas of the quarri thi month , have deploy graduat student to meticul catalog the fossil near in time to the mass extinct .But they are not the onli fossil hunter here .Onc a year for the past four year , the quarri ha been open to the public , and citizen paleontologist have come in drove  about 1,500 for the most recent commun event last fall .I found a pile of rock ,  said Alexandra Hopper of Mantua , one of the particip . When we rins them off , wer hope some of them are fossils. The digger kept the fossil they found , and there are plenti to go around . The doom creatur in the pit were mostli clam and oyster . But the fossil of anim like crocodil and sea turtl are here , too , as well as the occasion mosasaur , a feroci aquat lizard with two long teeth at the back of it throat that point toward it gullet , ensur that ani prey it swallow would never struggl out .Fossil are be found throughout the sediment that fill the pit , but the assemblag occupi a singl concentr layer . Bone and shell sometim pile up when current sweep dead sea creatur toward a particular eddi , where they accumul over year or centuri .But here the skeleton of the larger creatur remain larg intact . That suggest they all die at the same time and then settl gentli on the sea bottom .The date of the fossil layer put their death tantalizingli close in time to the impact of a meteor off what is now the Yucatn Peninsula in Mexico . Most paleontologist think that the climat cataclysm that follow kill three-quart of the speci live on Earth  and all of the dinosaur except those that evolv into bird .A seem paradox of mass extinct is that scientist rare find the remain of ani of the billion of anim that die . All over the world , the bone of the last dinosaur are almost alway found well below the extinct layer , which is mark by iridium , an element concentr in asteroid and comet .For paleontologist , that is not a surpris , given the rare condit need to preserv fossil and the fact that world is not cram with anim .Kill everi deer in New Jersey and then tri to find a dead deer , and your not go to find one ,  said Kirk Johnson , the director of the Smithsonian Nation Museum of Natur Histori .A futur paleontologist would struggl to find a bone bed or other sign of an instant die-off , becaus the squar footag of anim isnt veri big compar to the squar footag of the world ,  Dr. Johnson said .And yet here in Mantua , there is a mass death assemblag close to 66 million year old . It sound silli , but is it the case that thi pit in South Jersey , behind Lowe , ha the one window into thi pivot moment in time ?  Dr. Lacovara said .A centuri and a half ago , southern New Jersey wa a hotb of dinosaur discoveri . While scatter bone had been found in Europ , the first nearli complet dinosaur skeleton  that of an 8-foot-tal , 14-foot-long duck-bil hadrosauru  wa dug up in a quarri in Haddonfield in 1858 .New Jersey becam an earli battlefield in the bone war ,  the feroci competit between two pre-emin American paleontologist of the 19th centuri , Edward Drinker Cope of the Academi of Natur Scienc in Philadelphia and Othniel C. Marsh of Yale Univers .Cope live in Haddonfield and collect fossil in the area . After invit Marsh for a visit , Cope claim that hi guest paid the Haddonfield quarri owner to send fossil to Yale , not to the academi .In 1866 , Cope describ the bone of a meat-eat dinosaur , a rel of Tyrannosauru rex , found in anoth Mantua quarri . But he and Marsh shift their attent to grander fossil site in the West , and New Jersey paleontolog histori fade .In recent year , the most stun dinosaur fossil have come from place as far away as Argentina , Mongolia and the Sahara . In 2014 , Dr. Lacovara , then at Drexel Univers in Philadelphia , unveil Dreadnoughtu , a behemoth unearth in the Patagonia region of Argentina .If not for the recess in 2007 , the fossil in Mantua might be buri and out of reach .For the better part of a centuri , the Inversand Compani scoop a dark greenish sand call marl from the quarri for use in water treatment plant . But tighten environment regul turn that busi into a money loser , and Inversand start look to close the site .A Mantua redevelop plan call for fill the hole and build apart and a shop center on top . Almost six year ago , Dr. Lacovara propos someth differ . He want to preserv the quarri , both as a dig site for paleontologist and as a museum for inspir the younger gener .Paleontologist had long known about the fossil in the quarri and in other marl pit in the region .Inversand enthusiast support the idea . Bulldoz clear out a section of the pit so that Dr. Lacovara and hi student could meticul excav fossil , and there they uncov the mass death assemblag .Township offici want to buy the quarri , but did not have the $ 2 million that the 65-acr site would cost .Inversand wa spend sever hundr thousand dollar a year keep the pump run to divert water that would otherwis flow in . An applic for a state grant remain in limbo . And so last summer compani offici told Dr. Lacovara that the pump would be turn off at the end of the year .That wa go to be it , and the quarri wa go to be a lake by mid-Januari ,  he said .Rowan turn out to be the savior .After ship the Dreadnoughtu skeleton back to Argentina at the end of 2014 , Dr. Lacovara met with the university presid , Ali A. Houshmand . Dr. Houshmand lure Dr. Lacovara , who wa a student there when it wa Glassboro State Colleg , with a promis to creat a school of the earth and environ , of which Dr. Lacovara would be the found dean .For Dr. Lacovara , an essenti part of the deal wa for Rowan to buy the Inversand quarri . Dr. Houshmand agre .In Septemb , crowd fill the quarri for the fourth annual commun fossil dig . They arriv in four wave , at appoint time , and Dr. Lacovara greet each group .Who want to find some fossil ?  he exhort . Go have some fun. For thi day , the quarri wa a scientif sandbox for peopl big and small .In a cordoned-off area , some of Dr. Lacovara graduat student continu their work on the preciou layer , explain their find to onlook .Elsewher visitor scoop through the soil , present their find to the expert , mostli the grad student , as if in a fossil version of Antiqu Roadshow  except these heirloom were million of year old .Some were just rock , other harden lump of sand that came apart when squeez . But there were thrill except .Thi is a brachiopod ,  one expert told Michael Lloyd , 8 , of Mantua , describ a clamlik creatur .Daddi , I found a brachiopod !  the discover shout .With the futur of the quarri now safe , Dr. Lacovara envis more fossil day and school trip and a visitor center overlook the pit . We realli want to integr thi in the commun ,  he said . It a live , chang place.The hope is not necessarili to produc paleontologist , but to teach young peopl how to deciph the mysteri of the world .Kid start to think of scienc as a process ,  Dr. Lacovara said . It a way of ask question about your world.As for the possibl that he ha found a dinosaur-era graveyard date to the mass extinct , Dr. Lacovara is care to say that he doe not have convinc evid yet .We are in the trying-to-poke-holes-in-it phase ,  he said . There go to be so mani arrow aim at that.But it is a hypothesi worth pursu .Certainli we have rock that are near that time ,  he said . I know wer damn close.', 'COMANCH NATION GRASSLAND , Colo.  On a dri , chilli morn in the Southern Colorado grassland , Bruce Schumach led a group of AmeriCorp volunt across the narrow , shallow Purgatoir River to an out-of-plac bump in the landscap .He push asid loos , reddish dirt with hi hand , reveal a bone the size of a microwav oven  the limb of a sauropod dinosaur , said Dr. Schumach , a paleontologist . The worker were surpris that the fossil wa just sit out on the plain , unguard . Two of them joke about come back at night to pull it out of the ground .A two-hour ride down a dirt road , far from cellphon servic or ani other sign of human life , Picketwir Canyon is a dinosaur lover dream , larg becaus of hundr of hubcap-s theropod and sauropod footprint press into a nearbi layer of limeston , which abut the river .Dr. Schumach , 48 , who live in La Junta , Colo. , is one of two field paleontologist employ by the Unit State Forest Servic . They are respons for protect and promot dinosaur remnant scatter across the agency 193 million acr , primarili in the Rocki Mountain state .The fossil site to which Dr. Schumach led the volunt is just one of mani in the Morrison Format , layer of rock line 100-foot-tal mesa alongsid the canyon . The site wa discov month beforehand , but becaus there were too mani dinosaur bone and too few peopl to excav them , it wa reburi , for protect against thiev and the element . For month , these bone lay undisturb in the grassland like buri treasur .The two steward of the Forest Service dinosaur bone are far outnumb by the approxim 350 archaeologist employ to manag the trace of human life , though the dinosaur were around far longer than human have been .It all goe back to the law and the homocentr of those law ,  Dr. Schumach said of the dispar .The Nation Histor Preserv Act requir strict protect of human structur built 50 or more year ago on feder land . With the requir come fund for archaeologist . While Dr. Schumach and hi Forest Servic counterpart do team with academ research and museum , which provid some outsid fund for protect of bone , there is no law that protect paleontolog resourc to the same degre .So to get dinosaur bone from Picketwir Canyon to museum and scientist , Dr. Schumach ha develop a creativ strategi . Twice a year , for a week at a time , these bone and footprint are uncov by a group of about two dozen volunt , mani in their 70 and 80 , whom Dr. Schumach ha been train for the last 15 year .Becaus of the program popular , he no longer advertis it . Most of the volunt have devotedli return for everi project and becom a highli skill team .Dure their first week , in 2001 , volunt search along the lower edg of the canyon wall that frame the valley for the bluish-whit fossil that stand out among the brown and gray rock and bright yellow grass  develop their bone goggl ,  Dr. Schumach call it .By the second-to-last day , theyd found noth . So one volunt took from hi knapsack some petrifi wood he had brought back to show hi deject partner .That not wood ,  Dr. Schumach recal tell the volunt , who led the team back to where he had found the fossil .There , over the next sever season , the crew spent a week or two everi year uncov a Camarasauru that they name Woodi . In all , they pull out about 15 percent of the skeleton , now on display in the Sternberg Museum of Natur Histori at Fort Hay State Univers in Kansa .Most of the volunt are amateur interest in paleontolog , like a retir meat cutter , a retir secretari of an oil and ga compani and a retir aerospac engin . Some did their own bone hunt befor they found the program . Other were look for opportun for travel-ori post-retir volunt work ; mani have work on similar archaeolog project around the world .Ruthann White , 80 , say she rememb race back , goose-bump , to what she refer to as her bone  a big , pork-chop-lik pelvic bone  after month away . She ha been part of 23 of the group 24 expedit .Bigger bone often requir sever week of tediou work , spread out over season , as the volunt delic coax them out of clay or mudston .In Octob 2014 , rest on hi side in a safari hat , Ms. White husband , Allen , 80 , care brush dirt from a bone lodg in the Riversid Quarri wall . Nearbi , a mutton-chop volunt name Leroy Frazier , 62 , ( licens plate : BONEDGR ) care reassembl what look like a football-s vertebra . Thi is Sunday jigsaw puzzl ,  he said , laugh .Up the river from the quarri , on anoth day of prospect for dinosaur , less season volunt push broom across the dri limeston riverb . Everi coupl of minut someon uncov new track made by theropod ( biped carnivor whose print show three talonlik toe ) or sauropod ( plant eater that walk on all four , leav circular print like pothol ) .The footprint stretch for yard , disappear and reappear over the year , as flood and the river itself alter the landscap . It alway been call the longest track site in North America ,  said Dr. Schumach , ad that with recent discoveri by hi volunt , it may be the biggest collect of track in the world .A Forest Servic tractor scoop dust off the riverb , leav about six inch to be more gentli remov by volunt .Theropod track in the riverb follow , and sometim overlap , those of sauropod . For thi reason , some at the site specul that the track might be a game trail : theropod stalk their sauropod prey .Thi is where the big boy start get in troubl ,  said Sonni Fernandez , 77 , rest by sauropod track that get deeper with each step and appear to be angl errat left . All those young one seen him come , said , Hey , fat boy.All sign suggest that thi substanti trackway continu well beyond the berm of dirt where the volunt stop at the end of the week . And the group recent discoveri of adult sauropod track alongsid previous uncov juvenil track lend support to an emerg theori that these dinosaur travel as a famili .But the print still buri are almost certain to remain mysteri until the volunt return . Fortun for Dr. Schumacher mental health , he is in no rush to see the 150-million-year-old print expos . Still , he say that with more resourc , the Forest Servic could replic the type of educ program that current exist .Befor join the Forest Servic , he had work on Sue , the best-preserv Tyrannosauru rex ever found , as part of a team hire by the Field Museum in Chicago .The fossil discoveri , in South Dakota , led to a major legal disput involv the landown , the finder and the feder govern . In 1997 , the Field Museum paid $ 8.36 million for Sue at auction .At that time the Forest Servic got thi sens that fossil are worth a lot of money ,  Dr. Schumach said .In particular , Toadstool Geolog Park in Nebraska wa see a lot of small-scal theft , he said  old mammal bone be flip for nickel and dime on the black market . Back then , he ad , the posit of the Forest Servic wa : Peopl are steal stuff . We dont realli know how to manag it . Wer not go to manag it . But wer not go to let them steal it.That wa the impetu of the whole program ,  he said of the Forest Service s paleontolog effort .In the earli 1990 , the agenc hire it first paleontologist , Barbara Beasley , to identifi Forest Servic resourc worth protect . Dr. Schumach wa brought on a coupl of year later . Sinc then , theft of fossil and bone have decreas , Dr. Schumach said , and interest in preserv ha grown .Still , fund is hard to come by . The agency two-person field paleontolog program is part of the miner depart , which is primarili concern with valuabl coal and oil deposit . The Forest Service archaeolog program and the Bureau of Land Management paleontolog program , by contrast , are place in their agency heritag depart . The heritag depart are gear toward educ , rather than commod like oil and ga , and are therefor more equip to fund educ and preserv effort .The academ histori of paleontolog in the Unit State ha tradit place it within the realm of geoscienc ,  Denis Ottaviano , an agenc spokeswoman , said in an email . Most academ institut place archaeolog as a subdisciplin of anthropolog and paleontolog as a subdisciplin of geology.When the Forest Servic creat it paleontolog program in the 1990 , it follow that model , place it in the miner depart , where it remain today , a misfit : an education-bas program among a bunch of commodity-bas program .In the 23,000-acr Picketwir Canyon alon , Dr. Schumach know of a half-dozen substant bone site in addit to the cover track site . Some are untouch , and other have been onli survey by the small group of volunt work two week each year . He laud the Rocki Mountain region of the Forest Servic , the onli region that employ field paleontologist . He say he doe not expect dozen of new colleagu but he would like the Forest Servic to hire a third paleontologist so that the volunt program can be replic in other part of the countri .The real valu come from educ and talk with kid learn about the histori of the earth ,  he said . That not a commod that your go to sell and burn.Hi wish may be grant . Regul direct the Forest Servic to carri out the Nation Paleontolog Resourc Preserv Act of 2009  which seek to curb the theft or collect of fossil on public land but doe not contain specif preserv mandat like those in the Nation Histor Preserv Act  were establish in April , Ms. Ottaviano said , ad that the agenc wa consid addit staf .Meanwhil , the volunt in Picketwir Canyon keep dig .At the end of anoth day work , they ate dinner togeth , share beer and wine . They reminisc about dig from a decad ago , ask Dr. Schumach for progress updat on their big find , which are showcas in academ paper and in museum throughout the Southwest .A group of beard men stay up late , talk paleo shop , but the next morn , everyon wa up earli , eager to get back to their site along the Purgatoir River .Back at the track site , volunt were dig excitedli toward the back wall , hope to learn what would come of the errat angl sauropod . Becaus the anim appear to have lost it foot , the locat of it next track were becom harder to guess .You dinosaur need to straighten out ,  Mr. Fernandez said , shovel in hand , address the pile of dirt cover the track .Dr. Schumach admir a deep track and wonder about the print beyond the volunteers reach beneath the berm .The bone in the back wall are alway the most interest ,  he said .', 'Cloud help amplifi El Nio effect on the atmospher to a greater degre than onc thought , a new studi report .In El Nio condit , sea surfac temperatur in the Pacif Ocean becom unusu warm and tall thunderhead , known as cumulonimbu cloud , form over the water .Abov them , a layer of colder cirru cloud also appear . The cirru cloud trap heat .They act as a blanket and further warm the atmospher ,  said Thorsten Mauritsen , a meteorologist at the Max Planck Institut for Meteorolog in Germani and one of the study author .In the area that surround El Nio , cumulonimbu cloud are rarer and the sea is more often cover by lower cloud , which cool the air .Dr. Mauritsen and hi colleagu compar climat model simul that account for the role of cloud with model that did not .They found that if cloud are not factor in , the strength of an El Nio event is underestim by about two-third .Thi phenomenon ha a big impact on life around the Pacif , and I can see how it could help us anticip climat of the futur ,  he said .The studi appear in the journal Natur Geoscienc .', 'After a six-year effort , research on the Spanish island of Majorca have rid sever group of Majorcan midwif toad of the pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidi  better known as chytrid fungu , or B.d . It the first time the diseas , which is devast amphibian worldwid , ha been erad in a wild popul .Thi is proof of principl that you can go out there and mitig infect and that the method doesnt need to be that complex ,  said Trenton Garner , a biologist at the Zoolog Societi of London , who report the find with hi co-author in the journal Biolog Letter .Describ in 1998 follow mass die-off of frog in Australia and Panama , B.d . colon cell on the outer layer of an amphibian moist skin , caus the skin to thicken and interf with electrolyt transport . The infect eventu lead to cardiac arrest .An extrem generalist , the fungu infect mani type of frog , salamand , newt and toad . It ha been confirm in 700 speci on six contin . Sever are presum to have been driven to extinct , while mani other have suffer catastroph popul declin .Research do not know whi the fungu is so virul ; around 1,000 chytrid speci exist in the wild , but onli two are known to infect vertebr . It not a biolog sound strategi for a parasit to caus it host commun to go into seriou declin or drive it host to extinct , but that is the case for thi fungu ,  Dr. Garner said . It veri worrisome.Some zoo and research lab have manag to clear up the infect in captiv popul , but until now no one ha done so in the wild . The lucki recipi of thi experi is the Majorcan midwif toad , a speci onc thought to be extinct that wa rediscov in the 1980 in sever isol pond in the island limeston outcrop .A success captiv breed effort allow conservationist to expand the nativ frog rang ( despit it name , Majorcan midwif toad are not true toad ) . But in 2007 , wildlif manag found that chytrid had sneak into the wild popul  like introduc via the captive-br individu meant to save the speci .In 2009 , Dr. Garner and hi colleagu began their effort to clear the frog of the fungu . They focus on the tadpol , which readili pick up the infect in pond where they live , but are not kill by it . When the tadpol metamorphos into frog , howev , mass mortal ensu . The research remov thousand of tadpol from five pond and then drain the pond almost complet , hope that the sun warmth would kill the chytrid , which is sensit to temperatur .Back in the lab on Majorca , they bath the tadpol in antifung and kept them in captiv for month , until rain replenish the pond . Cross their finger , the research return the fungus-fre tadpol . But within a year , chytrid wa back .The research were not dissuad . They tri again in 2012 , but instead of just remov and treat the tadpol , they also appli low concentr of a common commerci disinfect to some of the pond and the rocki cranni around them .The follow year , tadpol and frog in the three pond that were disinfect and whose tadpol resid were treat did not have ani sign of B.d . Three year on , those three pond are still fungu free , and the research have gone on to appli the treatment to the remain two pond as well .They set out to elimin a major threat to the surviv of a veri special frog , and they were success ,  said David Wake , an amphibian specialist and evolutionari biologist at the Univers of California , Berkeley , who wa not involv in the research . It took year , but it work  so far.The hope now is that thi success will rais interest in mitig effort beyond Majorca .

Whether a few case explod into a full-fledg outbreak depend on a set of factor far more complex than the weather .The list of scari bug-born ill seem to get longer everi year : Lyme , West Nile , Chaga , dengu , chikungunya  and now Zika , the first case of which turn up in Puerto Rico last week .Some factor in the new spread are , for now , unstopp , scientist say : the weather is hotter ; cheap airfar mean human travel more than they did decad ago ; and citi in tropic countri are becom more crowd , creat nurseri for each diseas .But other factor can be manipul to stop outbreak : insect can be kill ; patient can be cure befor they are bitten again ; vaccin can be develop ; and simpl measur like screen , air-condit and bug spray can play big role .Brazil is now in a panic over Zika , a mosquito-born viru that may be caus thousand of babi to be born with tini head and brain , a defect call microcephali .Until May , Zika had never touch thi hemispher except on Easter Island , 2,200 mile off the Chilean coast . Now it circul in 14 Latin American or Caribbean countri and Puerto Rico .Earli last month , an offici from the Center for Diseas Control and Prevent predict that Zika would follow the pattern in the Unit State that dengu ha : mani case in Puerto Rico , follow by outbreak in Florida , Gulf Coast state and mayb Hawaii .But the C.D.C . is unwil to predict the aftermath , includ whether all outbreak will be snuf out befor ani babi will suffer .Inform is pretti limit ,  Dr. Erin Stapl , a C.D.C . epidemiologist for vector-born diseas , said of Brazil outbreak . There hasnt been enough test for Zika , so it not known how mani women have been infected.Promin virologist say Zika play a role in microcephali but they are not sure it is the onli caus ; it may depend , for exampl , on whether the mother wa previous infect with dengu , a relat viru .How far the infect can spread in the Unit State will depend on whether the Asian tiger mosquito , Aed albopictu , turn out to transmit it as effici as Aed aegypti , the yellow fever mosquito .The yellow fever mosquito is not usual seen much farther north than Washington , D.C. , and Kentucki , but the chill-toler Asian tiger is sometim found as far north as New York and Chicago .Pest control will also be crucial .

They often follow linguist or ethnic one .In thi hemispher , chikungunya wa first seen in late 2013 on the island of St. Martin . It start on the island French-speak half and jump to other Francophon island and to French Guiana , Dr . Stapl said .Zika arriv on Easter Island in 2014 . Although the island is Chilean territori , it origin popul wa Polynesian . Zika ha been island-hop in the South Pacif sinc 2007 .Easter Island hold an annual festiv that attract Polynesian , who may have brought Zika with them . The viru probabl reach Brazil by a differ rout , via the influx of tourist dure the 2014 World Cup , or paddler from French Polynesia who particip in a cano race in Rio de Janeiro .West Nile , which appear in thi hemispher in 1999 , famous exemplifi a viru move independ of climat chang .The outbreak began in New York Citi , and the strain wa 99 percent ident to an Isra one , so mani virologist believ it arriv in the blood of someon on a plane . The first case were in Queen , home to Kennedi Intern Airport , so the viru might also have been hide in a stowaway mosquito or , less like , a bird .West Nile spread slowli west , halt each winter as mosquito die off and the bird they fed on flew south . It took till 2005 to reach the Pacif Northwest .Mosquito-born pathogen are not the onli one on the move .Tick can carri more than 30 diseas , and some , includ Rocki Mountain spot fever , can be fatal . That infect , onc banish from northern Mexico , is surg again and move up into Arizona for the first time , accord to Gerardo Alvarez , an epidemiologist at the Univers of Sonora .Children , especi those who sleep besid dog , are the hardest hit , and some Indian reserv in Arizona have held rodeos of the semifer dog that roam from hous to hous , put tick collar on them .Elsewher in the Unit State , the Gulf Coast tick is expand north , and other speci that carri a combin 18 infecti bacteria are be found in new place .The import of live condit and medic treatment is exemplifi by malaria .

They have antibodi in their blood that caus fals posit result on test for Zika viru .Veri few American have those antibodi , so test should be more effect . On the other hand , Zika produc symptom like fever and rash far less often than dengu doe , so it may be spread by silent carrier who feel well .In 2009 , Dr. Weaver wa a co-author of a paper that foresaw the emerg of Zika viru in the America , although he envis Japanes enceph and Rift Valley fever as the greatest threat . He rank Zika in the also keep an eye on categori , with yellow fever and Mayaro viru .Zika may have chang in the past decad ,  he said .

He settl on a plan and share the detail with a Facebook friend : He would drop DMT , a power psychedel , and then cut hi throat .Everyon wa tell me what I could and couldnt do  doctor , my parent ,  said Frank , now a 19-year-old colleg student . I wa go to hurt myself , to show peopl , Look , I am still in control of my life.And so , in time , he wa . Frank , who eight month earlier had receiv a diagnosi of psychosi , the signatur symptom of schizophrenia , and had been in and out of the hospit , gradual learn to take charg of hi own recoveri , in a new approach to treatment for peopl experienc a first psychot break with realiti .At a time when lawmak in Washington are debat large-scal reform to the mental health care system , analyst are care watch a hand of new first-break program like the one that treat Frank in New York as a way to potenti eas the cycl of hospit and lifetim disabl that afflict so mani mental ill peopl .More than two million peopl in the Unit State have receiv a diagnosi of schizophrenia . Most are consign to whatev treatment is avail amid a hodgepodg of program that often focu on antipsychot drug to blunt delus and paranoia  medicin that can come with side effect so debilit that mani patient go off them and end up in a loop of hospit and despair .But over the past sever year , a number of state have set up program with a differ approach , emphas support servic , like sustain one-on-on therapi , school and work assist , and famili educ , as well as medic . The therapist work to engag each patient as an equal partner in decis  includ about medic dosag , to make it as toler as possibl .In a landmark studi publish thi fall , government-back research report that after two year , peopl who had thi combin packag were do better on a varieti of measur than those who receiv treatment as usual . The differ wa modest but notabl . And , significantli , the particip continu to receiv care for six month longer on averag .Frank , who ask that hi last name not be use to protect hi privaci , came to trust hi therapist in the program enough that he told her of hi suicid plan  and she foil it , with help from hi mother .He quit talk to peopl the summer befor hi junior year in high school , and that decis drove the onc social young man  a skateboard and an accompliish student  so deepli into hi own head that he seem beyond reach .I wa hear voic , and everi convers I had , the voic were ask , What is thi person think ?  They think Im a loser . Theyr make fun of me ,  Frank said recent over pizza near hi apart in the San Francisco Bay Area . Dress in a light jacket and khaki , he wa watch , low-key and engag , as if discuss someth with a professor after class . The real voic would merg with the one in my head , and there wa just too much nois . I had to shut it down.He told no one what wa happen . Not hi parent , not hi friend . He simpli retreat ; in hi spare time , he would hole up in hi bedroom in hi family colonial-styl hous outsid New York Citi , the shade down , the door lock , the cover pull over hi head , hi face lost in the dead blue glow of a laptop .I thought at first he wa just be an obstin teenag ,  hi father said .Hi best friend , Perri , said he got Frank out of the hous one morn , and the two went to a local bagel place . He just told me : Hey man , it over , I dont want to see you anymor ,  said Perri , who ask that hi last name not be use , to protect Frank . He wa so calm when he said it , it freak me out.Frank parent had sent their son to specialist befor and receiv diagnos of depress and attent deficit disord . But thi wa someth much more omin , hi mother said in an interview recent in the sunroom of their home . The wall in the formal live room were a galleri of proud famili memori . She and Frank father ask that the family ident be protect so their son would have a chanc at a normal life in a countri where psychosi is often stigmat . But they spoke in detail about Frank experi to give other famili hope .Onc a model student at hi suburban high school , Frank suddenli began smoke marijuana daili , skip most of hi class and pace the school hallway in a tranc . Hi mother read note in the margin of one of hi notebook  rambl , self-attack  and found them so disturb that she call 911 .The polic show up and escort Frank to a hospit . After be on heavi medic for sever week , he came home .In the month that follow , he land in the hospit yet again . But he also , final , receiv a diagnosi that made sens to hi parent : psychosi , the signatur hallucin and delus of schizophrenia .We were go through thi revolv door ,  hi mother said . Hed have a crisi , then land in the hospit , then come home and go off hi medic and end up right back in the hospital. She and her husband contact everi major medic center in the New York Citi area , look for treatment program , but those avail had such strict criteria  for instanc , bipolar disord with psychot featur and substanc abus  that their son didnt qualifi for ani of them .Final , one doctor suggest a new program call OnTrackNi , develop specif for peopl who had had their first psychot break within the past two year .It wa fall 2013 , about a year after Frank symptom were identifi as psychosi . Thi time , he qualifi ; he wa one of the first client accept .On that first day , he and hi mother sat across from a therapist , and she explain hi situat . Frank stare into space . Then the therapist , Tia Dole , program director of the OnTrackNi site at the Mental Health Associ of Westchest , did someth unexpect . I ask hi mom to leav the room ,  Dr. Dole said .Exil to the wait room , Frank mother half-expect him to storm out , or the therapist to give up . Neither happen . A few weekli session later , she heard someth absent for year .Laugh ,  she said . He wouldnt say a word to me in the car , at home , even pass in the hallway . And now he in there laugh ? The philosophi behind OnTrackNi and similar program is root in two principl . One is that peopl are most like to benefit when support servic are avail as a complet packag : name , a last relationship with a therapist ; famili counsel ; school and work assist ; group therapi ; and medic manag , as in a system for adjust dose so they are toler .Most treatment center offer some but not all of these element , base in part on what is cover by insur . Work and school support are usual not cover , for instanc .The second principl is the one that appeal so strongli to Frank : that peopl are more like to agre to and continu treatment if they help determin it direct .Thi idea is hardli new ; therapist were engag psychot patient as collabor a centuri ago , and mani clinician still do . But over the year , collabor ha taken a back seat to complianc in a system focus mainli on keep peopl stabil on antipsychot drug .The first psychiatrist I saw , he wa lead the convers , tell me what to do ,  said Bell , 22 , a student who ha stabil in a similar program in Oregon call EASA , or Earli Assess and Support Allianc . She ask that her last name not be use , to protect her privaci .By contrast , she said , EASA therapist ask her what her goal were and what she want to do : I felt like I wa in control.Dr. Lisa Dixon of the New York State Psychiatr Institut , who direct OnTrackNi , put it thi way : We want to reinvent treatment so that it wa someth peopl actual want.At least five state have such coordinated-servic program establish , and the program are expand quickli . EASA began with five center and in 2007 open center in counti throughout the state . The New York program began in 2013 , with four locat around New York Citi , and ha sinc ad a half-dozen more statewid . The program reli on a combin of state fund and insur reimburs , and 32 state have begun use block grant set asid by Congress in 2014 to fund such program .How much differ those program will make is not clear . For exampl , the government-back studi releas thi fall found that the new approach had not reduc hospit , a big driver of expens .But at last count , about 80 percent of the peopl who enrol in OnTrackNi 18 month ago have remain in the program . Most of them were still in school or work , accord to Dr. Dixon , who is also a professor of psychiatri at Columbia . About 60 percent of those who receiv care through EASA , the longer-run Oregon program , are work or in school , accord to Tamara Sale , the program director of care .Those are view as veri good number ; studi suggest that young peopl in the first stage of treatment drop out at high rate , from 30 percent to more than 50 percent in the first year .The reason for the improv , some expert say , probabl includ increas famili particip , more collabor in medic decis , and the fact that , unlik their counterpart in mani commun clinic , the new programs staffer track down peopl who miss appoint .The reason he open up to Dr. Dole , Frank said , wa that at the end of the day , she let me have my delus ,  he said .For instanc , I told her onc how everi time I went outsid , I wa sure peopl were take video of me on their phone and post it online.She would listen and listen , and let me finish and then say , How sure are you that true ? Not so sure , he would say .In thi way , Dr. Dole simultan took the delus serious and help Frank identifi them as unreli . I dont even call them delus ,  she said . I call them beliefs.OnTrackNi also advis Frank parent on how to manag their son when he wa in the grip of a delus at home . She told us to focu on the emot he wa experienc and not so much on what he wa say , hi accus , whatev it wa ,  Frank mother said . So , for instanc , wed say , I can see your angri , how can I help you ? Like mani peopl with psychosi , Frank strongli resist take antipsychot medic . He had gain 20 pound on one of the drug , and anoth had made it hard for him to form thought . Both are common side effect of such medic .It wa dure one unmed period that Frank develop hi elabor suicid plan . He wa seriou enough to promis an equal troubl Facebook friend that he wa on the brink of act . But he also inform Dr. Dole , almost casual , as he recal it  and , thi time , she wa the one who had him hospit .I never would have said anyth if I didnt trust her , so yeah , I felt betray when she had me taken away ,  Frank said . But I am still here , thank to her.Dr. Dole use that art of persist suggest to persuad Frank to tri medic again , remind him that the two of them , with the help of the program psychiatrist , would work out what dosag  and which drug  wa best .If he did not like a medic , she told him , he could quit . If he prefer veri low dose  enough to eas the voic but not quiet them , for instanc  he could do that , too .Mani peopl quit the drug , not onli becaus of the side effect but becaus they do not think the medicin is make much differ . These new program address thi doubt by have the patient and at least one famili member keep a care diari of behavior chang as a dosag is gradual reduc . The diari provid a clear record from multipl point of view .Frank also met with a social worker at the program , Jim Coyl , who help arrang for him to continu hi studi at home while tri to cope with the psychosi .In spring 2014 , about six month into the program and back home from the hospit , Frank began speak to hi parent again . He and hi father talk about the saxophonist John Coltran and play album togeth . He hung out with hi mother in the kitchen , help her cook . And then , one night , as hi parent were go to sleep , Frank came in and sat on their bed .He had a plan , he said . He want to go to colleg . In California .Mi husband and I turn to each other and said , We cant even get him out of hi room , how are we go to get him to California ?  hi mother recal .After everyth that happen ,  Frank said , I didnt think theyd take it seriously.But they did . He is in hi second year now at colleg in the Bay Area , take a light load of three class and conduct hi own cours , of sort , in self-treat . He regularli visit a clinic here , where he receiv medic  an antidepress , as well as an antipsychot drug . From a low-dosag begin , he ha decid he need more . Until recent , he also attend group therapi .I know what I need now ,  he said over lunch on a recent Friday .That first year away , he said , he wa off medic and began to have a creep feel that the hous complex where he live wa the center of a prostitut ring run by the Yakuza , a Japanes crime syndic . The Yakuza ,  he said , shake hi head . That when I knew I better go back on the medication.He in regular touch with hi parent , he said , and ha reconnect with hi friend Perri back in New York , and plan to becom a psychologist to help other like himself . He ha also made some new friend at colleg . They occasion ask him where he ha been after a psychiatr appoint .He doe not feel the need to tell them . I dont think of myself as somebodi who is mental ill , you know ?  he said .

Whi do some varieg plant grow back without the origin pattern after prune ?A. Varieg , in the form of the familiar dark and light pattern of leav in some plant , result from variat in the presenc or absenc of chloroplast , the bodi in a cell that use the green pigment chlorophyl to produc sugar through photosynthesi .A common caus of varieg is that a leaf can have more than one kind of genet makeup in cell in the same tissu system , make the plant what is call a chimera . The cell with gene that produc activ chloroplast are green , and those without are white or anoth color .Varieg can occur through natur mutat or can be the result of select and propag of a desir pattern . For exampl , in one common varieg plant , the snake plant or mother-in-law tongu , Sansevieria trifasciata , some cultiv varieti have yellow edg , and other do not .Thi kind of varieg result from what happen at the region at the tip of a shoot where most of the cell divis and growth take place , call the apic meristem .Mutat cell without activ chloroplast give rise to more of the same as the leaf grow . But if the plant is cut back , interf with the activ of the variou layer of the meristem , new shoot will often have cell that give rise to just green cell , rather than the two kind of cell that produc the attract striation . question @ nytimes.com', 'MINNEAPOLI  He saw the lioness as he walk back from the rocki outcrop in the Serengeti where , tire of sit for hour in the car , he had gone explor on foot .She wa between him and the Land Rover , and she appear to be stalk him , her bodi crouch , her head lower .Iv been stupid ,  Craig Packer told himself .

As they had predict , femal lion prefer the stuf intrud with a dark mane to it blonder-man counterpart ; male were also more like to avoid the darker-man stuf lion .Dr. Packer is surprisingli unsentiment about the speci he studi .As a scientist , he said , he is fascin by lions social interact and their devot to one anoth . He admir their strength and unpredict .But he ha no patienc with those who think of the big cat as plush toy or cartoon charact , and he refus to use clich like beautiful or magnificent to describ them .Lion , he will tell you , sleep a lot . They are , as he write in hi book , thick as a brick. And they are danger : They will kill you and your littl dog , too ,  he is fond of say .Dr. Packer son , Jonathan , rememb watch The Lion King with hi father as a child and have him point out the scientif inaccuraci in the film .Dad , your ruin Disney for me ,  he final complain .Dr. Packer strong view and devot to logic have sometim place him at odd with conservationist , anim welfar group and , on occas , other scientist .He an outspoken guy and he not diplomat ,  said Luke Hunter , the presid of the conserv organ Panthera , ad that he ha known Dr. Packer for year and respect him greatli .After interview African who had lost famili to lion attack  a babi rip from it mother arm , a woman bodi found torn in half in an outhous  Dr. Packer becam a propon of fenc wildlif preserv in Africa . It is a strategi he think will protect peopl and reduc retaliatori kill , help to stem the lion declin .But hi argument did not sit well with some environmentalist for whom fenc is at odd with the notion of preserv pristin wilder corridor .He wa amaz , he said , when one conserv organ told him to stop talk about man-eat lion becaus our donor wont like it.It stun me that they can stand up with a straight face and say there shouldnt be fenc ,  Dr. Packer said of the critic . You can have a corridor for bird , but if your plan on have a corridor for an anim that like to kill peopl on the way from A to B , no , I dont think so . I dont think it moral.Scientist often resist becom advoc , but Dr. Packer said he wa impel to cross the line by the problem he saw in the trophy-hunt industri .Barbara Maa , the director of endang speci conserv for the German conserv group NABU , call hi effort to bring about chang deepli courageous.Craig is somebodi who say , Here are the fact ,  Dr. Maa said . If they keep ignor the fact , he shout them louder.Matthew Eckert , the director of conserv for the foundat arm of Safari Club Intern , which defin it mission as protect hunters right and promot wildlif conserv ,  see it differ .Im not sure that Craig is capabl ani longer of separ object and hi opinion ,  Dr. Eckert said , ad that the lion expert intent seem to be to shut down lion hunting.The foundat is now financ it own survey of lion in Tanzania , with it research now occupi the hous in the Serengeti where Dr. Packer onc live .Still , Dr. Packer ha hardli given up . He is embark on new project in South Africa , write anoth book and pore through three decad of data from Tanzania .Im have an epiphani everi 10 day to two week ,  he said , ad that hi mother had often respond to hi achiev by say , So , what are you go to do next ? Leav Tanzania ha freed him to speak and write without worri about the consequ .When a lion name Cecil wa lure out of a nation park in Zimbabw and shot by a dentist from Minnesota earli last Juli , Dr. Packer took the opportun to share hi view with the journalist who sought him out .Despit the furor the kill provok , the dentist wa not entir to blame , he said  he probabl did not know he wa near a park . The real problem wa the trophy-hunt industri , which Dr. Packer said claim to help conserv lion popul while actual hurt them .The big lie of the hunt industri is , Dont worri kid , wer do it ,  he said . And theyr not.', 'The Nation Center for Health Statist report that the number of birth in 2014  3,988,076  wa 1 percent higher than in 2013 .Among the data publish last week is some good news . The teenag birthrat fell 9 percent , to 24.2 per 1,000 , and the birthrat for unmarri women declin for the sixth straight year .For younger women , there ha been a gener declin ,  said the lead author of the report , Bradi E. Hamilton , a statistician with the center . But teen are uniqu , becaus they are the focu of program and policies.Sinc the long-term declin in teenag birth began in 1991 , the rate ha gone down by 61 percent .The cesarean deliveri rate declin to 32.2 percent , the largest drop sinc the N.C.H. . began collect data . Wev had tini declin in the past , but thi year is big ,  said Michel J.K. Osterman , a health statistician with the center and one of the report co-author .Although preterm birth declin slightli , low birthweight ( under five and a half pound ) , a lead caus of infant mortal , remain unchang at 8 percent .It wa a banner year for twin : In 2014 , the rate of twin birth wa 33.9 per 1,000 , the highest ever . But the number of triplet and higher-ord birth declin by 5 percent . Ms. Osterman attribut the declin to new regul limit the number of embryo that can be implant in fertil procedur .There were some variat in birthrat by race and ethnic . While birth among white , black and Hispan women all rose 1 percent , the number of birth among Asian and Pacif Island went up 6 percent , and among American Indian and Alaskan Nativ declin 2 percent .Rate rose among women age 25 to 44 , and declin among the 10-to-14 and 45-to-49 age group . There were 743 birth to women older than 50 , up from 677 in 2013 .Dr. Hamilton note that the annual report had it limit .Our data come from birth certif . It ha a lot of strength , and we can focu on small group and small geograph area ,  he said . But it limit by attitudin bia . What peopl were think , how they use contracept and so on can onli be found out with survey . Our data doesnt give us that.', 'We tend to think of good gene as the one that make us thin , calm , cheer and healthi . Thi logic assumpt may not be complet accur : Dr. Lee Goldman suggest that even better gene may be the one that make us fat , anxiou and candid for the servic of a cardiologist like himself .It all a matter of perspect , and Dr. Goldman take the long , long view in Too Much of a Good Thing ,  argu that mani common modern ill result from the surpassingli excel gene that allow our speci to endur over the millennium . Onli veri recent did these survivor gene turn on us , creat the collect of overweight , hypertens , jumpi and miser individu we are today .Some of hi argument will probabl be familiar , at least when it come to the question of whi we have all becom so fat . Less ha been written about other area of human physiolog where our genet program seem to butt up against the circumst of modern life . Dr. Goldman integr it all into a complex narr  a littl tough sled at point , but still thought-provok .For our hunter-gather forebear to surviv , he remind us , they had to enthusiast consum larg quantiti of food when food wa avail . They had to scarf up substanti amount of salt and water as well  the uniqu human abil to sweat profus and keep the bodi cool by evapor gave hunter the stamina to keep up with their prey .Human blood had to clot effici , too , or peopl would have bled to death from the continu accid inher in outdoor life and women would have die from the bloodi process of childbirth . Final , primit human had to be continu vigil against attack , instinct fight some danger and hide from other , never lower their guard for a second .All those genet predisposit tend to be noth but troubl in modern time .When it come to food , we are program to ingest more calori than we need . Some trigger are social ( the pleasur of fine dine , the easi avail of tasti food ) , but mani more are inher in the body work . Our tast bud prefer calorie-laden item to other . Our intestin effici extract those calori from ingest food . Our bodi fight weight loss with an assort of hormon and appetite-stimul molecul that are rev up when pound disappear and may stay elev for year .Our natur tast for salt doubtless date to the time when salt and potabl water could be hard to find . Now we have plenti of both  and we sweat consider less than primit human did  but we still crave more salt than we need . Excess salt may caus or worsen high blood pressur , damag the heart , brain and kidney . Without that tast for salt , Dr. Goldman hazard , we might be abl to avoid high blood pressur altogether.Our risk for bleed to death is certainli far lower than wa primit man , but we have inherit hi complex , sophist blood clot system . When it is deploy in the blood vessel of the body intern organ , it can be veri difficult to turn off , caus common , often fatal event such as heart attack , stroke and giant clot in the lung .Final , that hard-wir alarm system in the brain also work against us . Nonspecif hypervigil and even occasion panic may have been critic when anim , predat and power and potenti homicid human were constant threat ,  Dr. Goldman write .Now , though , aggress may be intern into crippl anxieti , while the instinct to hide from or becom submiss to a predat may transform into depress , even suicid . Our defens against be murder are now precipit the anxieti and depress that are disabl and kill more of us than the violenc they were design to avoid ,  Dr. Goldman write .All is conjectur , certainli , but it make an interest stori . Would that Dr. Goldman , who is a dean at Columbia Univers Medic Center and a world-renown research , were a bit more of a natur storytel . Hi text bulg with fact and tangenti asid , zigzag across most of human histori and biolog to get to everi last relev morsel of inform . Small wonder that when it come to figur out what to do about these errant gene , Dr. Goldman begin to sound a littl fatigu .He point out that wait for evolut to clean itself up mean a long , long wait  meaning genet chang happen veri slowli . Hope for good behavior to compens for our errant survivor gene is also unlik to work well ; note the high failur rate of most diet and exercis program .We are left with modern medicin , and Dr. Goldman valiantli make a case for medic ourselv better with agent rang from the one we have now ( like good blood pressur drug ) to some highli hypothet compound ( like a chemic that mimic some of the benefit of exercis while the recipi loung on the couch ) .Perhap that pharmaceut approach to our inner cave man or cave woman will work out someday . In the meantim , we can take some psychic comfort from the fact that our pudgi may not be pure gluttoni , nor our anxieti some culpabl failur of the will . Forgiv your gene , Dr. Goldman conclud : A a societi we need to becom less judgment of one anoth and oftentim less critic of ourselves.', 'Throughout the day , a clock tick insid our bodi . It rous us in the morn and make us sleepi at night . It rais and lower our bodi temperatur at the right time , and regul the product of insulin and other hormon .The body circadian clock even influenc our thought and feel . Psychologist have measur some of it effect on the brain by have peopl take cognit test at differ time of day .As it turn out , late morn turn out to be the best time to tri do task such as mental arithmet that demand that we hold sever piec of inform in mind at onc . Later in the afternoon is the time to attempt simpler task , like search for a particular letter in a page of gibberish .Anoth clue about the clock in our brain come from peopl with condit such as depress and bipolar disord . Peopl with these disord often have troubl sleep at night , or feel groggi dure the day . Some peopl with dementia experi sundown ,  becom confus or aggress at the end of the day .Sleep and activ cycl are a veri big part of psychiatr ill ,  said Huda Akil , a neuroscientist at the Univers of Michigan .Yet neuroscientist have struggl to understand exactli how the circadian clock affect our mind . After all , research cant simpli pop open a subject skull and monitor hi brain cell over the cours of each day .A few year ago , Dr. Akil and her colleagu came up with an idea for the next best thing .The Univers of California , Irvin , store brain donat to scienc . Some of their former owner die in the morn , some in the afternoon and other at night . Dr. Akil and her colleagu wonder if there were differ in the brain depend on the time of day the donor had die .Mayb it simple-mind , but nobodi had thought of it ,  Dr. Akil said .She and her colleagu select brain from 55 healthi peopl whose caus of death were sudden , such as in car crash . From each brain , the research slice tissu from region import for learn , memori and emot .As each person die , hi brain cell were in the midst of make protein from certain gene . Becaus the brain had been quickli preserv , the scientist could still measur the activ of those gene at the time of death .Most of the gene they examin didnt show ani regular pattern of activ over the cours of the day . But they found that more than 1,000 gene follow a daili cycl . Peopl who die at the same time of day were make those gene at the same level .The pattern were so consist that the gene could act as a timestamp .We could ask , What time did thi person die ?  Dr. Akil said . And we could pin it to within an hour of their actual record time of death.She and her colleagu then ran the same analysi on the brain of 34 peopl who had had major depress befor die . Now they found that the time stamp wa wildli off the mark .It look as if peopl were on Japan time or Germani time ,  Dr. Akil said .Dr. Akil and her colleagu publish their result in 2013 , inspir research at the Univers of Pittsburgh School of Medicin to attempt to replic them .It wa someth we didnt think we could do befor ,  the neuroscientist Colleen A. McClung said .Dr. McClung and her colleagu perform a bigger version of the studi , examin 146 brain collect by the university donor program . The research publish their result thi week in The Proceed of the Nation Academi of Scienc .Lo and behold , we got veri nice rhythm ,  Dr. McClung said . It realli seem like a snapshot of where the brain wa at that moment of death.Dr. Akil is grate that anoth team of research took the effort to back up her find . There is a lot of overlap , which make you believ someth is go on for real here ,  she said .But Dr. McClung and her colleagu also did someth no one had . They compar the pattern of gene express in the brain of young and old peopl and found intrigu differ .The scientist hope to find clue to whi people circadian cycl chang as they age . A peopl get older , their rhythm tend to deterior and shift forward ,  Dr. McClung said .She found that some of the gene that were activ in strong daili cycl in young peopl fade in peopl older than 60 . It possibl that some older adult stop produc protein in their brain need to maintain circadian rhythm .To their surpris , howev , the research also discov some gene that becam activ in daili cycl onli in old age . It look like the brain might be tri to compens by turn on an addit clock ,  Dr. McClung said .Dr. Akil specul that the brain abil to cobbl togeth a backup clock might protect some older adult from neurodegen diseas . It may spell the differ between deterior or not ,  she said .Eventu , it might even be possibl to switch on our backup clock as a way to treat a rang of circadian-rel disord .Dr. Akil said that find clock-driven gene in human brain would help scientist run experi on anim to figur out what those gene are do .Instead of sit in your lab imagin what gene might be import , here your take your inspir from the human brain and say , What is it tri to tell us ?  she said .', 'Actual : To say that drink juic detoxifi the bodi isnt quit the same as claim leech suck out poison , but it fairli close .The practic of cleans ha becom as ubiquit as the use of hand sanit .

They draw substanc out of the bloodstream and process them for the bodi to excret as fece and urin .When ask what about thi process would be help by juic , Dr. Grendel seem at a loss .It hard to understand becaus there is no good scientif evid that a juic cleans , or ani other food for that matter , is particularli relev to remov toxin ,  he said .Thi isnt to say that drink vitamin-rich , antioxidant-fil veget juic cant be benefici for one health , he ad , or function as an effect tool for weight loss or reset one habit .

Juic requir less of the stomach digest process , it said .Who said that wa benefici ?  she said .And then she got to the inevit detox claim : Juic allow the bodi to have more of the resourc it need to support the phase of detoxif , and even to begin to help remov the cumul toxin store in the body.What doe that even mean ?  she said .

If juic is the path to that , great .The whole thing about juic is it make that easier to get . And it easili digest and absorb ,  he said .As for rest the stomach , he believ well-chew food is as good as juic , but most peopl dont chew well .Im a fanat about chew ,  he said .For Dr. Merrel , juic  like ani health food  provid nutrient that help the liver process toxin , much like greas on a gearshaft .

No gene drive have yet been test in the wild , but in laboratori organ like the fruit fli , they have convert almost the entir popul to carri the favor version of a gene .Gene drive could potenti prevent the spread of diseas , support agricultur by revers pesticid and herbicid resist in insect and weed , and control damag invas speci ,  a group of Harvard biologist wrote last year in the journal eLIF .A much discuss applic of gene drive would help rid the world of pest-born diseas like malaria , dengu fever and Lyme diseas .A gene drive design to render a popul extinct is known as a crash drive . A crash drive be develop for mosquito consist of a gene engin into the Y chromosom that shred the X chromosom in the cell that make the mosquito sperm , thu ensur that all progeni are male . Unless the drive itself is damag through mutat , the number of femal would be expect to dwindl each gener until the popul collaps .Biologist led by Andrea Crisanti and Toni Nolan at Imperi Colleg London report thi month in the journal Natur Biotechnolog their develop of mosquito with gene drive that disrupt three gene for femal fertil , each of which act at a differ stage of egg format . Becaus the femal mosquito are infertil onli when a copi is inherit from both parent , the gene drive would be thoroughli dissemin through a popul befor take their toll . They could suppress mosquito popul to level that do not support malaria transmiss ,  the author wrote .The mosquito are not yet readi for releas . Becaus natur select will heavili favor ani wild mosquito that acquir resist to the gene drive , the research need to prevent such resist from aris . One approach would be to target two or three site in the same fertil gene , give natur select a much higher barrier to overcom .Anoth approach is to endow mosquito with gene that make them resist to the malaria parasit . Last month , biologist at the Irvin and San Diego campus of the Univers of California report introduc a gene drive with a cargo of malaria-resist gene into mosquito . Such gene , if success propel throughout a wild mosquito popul , would render a region free of the malari parasit , which could no longer spread via mosquito bite .In agricultur , biologist envisag gene drive system that could destroy or modifi insect pest , and revers genet resist to pesticid in speci that had acquir it . Gene drive may also be use to squelch popul of harm invas speci like rat .Gene drive have two major technic limit . They will work onli in sexual reproduc speci , which effect rule out bacteria . Second , they spread significantli onli in speci that reproduc quickli , mean they would be of no practic use in eleph or peopl .Becaus no gene drive organ have yet been releas , biologist can not yet assess how well they will work and what degre of risk they may pose .The issu of risk , rather than effect , ha domin discuss for the last sever month . Biologist are eager to see the benefit of the technolog realiz , and wish to avoid ani consequ that might erod public confid or get gene drive system off on the wrong foot , as ha happen with genet modifi food . Sever articl publish in the last few month propos specif safeti precaut and call for full public discuss of gene drive , along with speedi regul .Becaus a singl escap organ carri a gene drive system could alter a substanti fraction of the wild popul with unpredict ecolog consequ , the decis to deploy a gene drive must be made collect by societi ,  a group of scientist , led by Georg M. Church of Harvard Medic School , said in Natur Biotechnolog last month .A gene drive refer to ani process that bias the usual pattern of Mendelian inherit , in which a gene ha a 50 percent chanc of make it to the next gener . Sever gene drive process exist in natur but are hard to manipul .In 2003 , Austin Burt , a biologist at a branch of Imperi Colleg London in Sunninghil , England , essenti laid out the whole theori of gene drive and their possibl applic base on natur gene drive known as home endonucleas . Clearli , the technolog describ here is not to be use lightli ,  he conclud . Given the suffer caus by some speci , neither is it obvious one to be ignored.An endonucleas is an enzym that cut at a specif site the DNA of the chromosom with which it gene own chromosom is pair . Becaus DNA break are veri threaten to genom integr , cell rush to repair them , often by use the other chromosom of a pair as a templat . In do so , they copi the gene for the endonucleas into the joint made between the two broken end of the cut chromosom . If thi repair occur in a germ line cell , both egg and sperm will carri the endonucleas gene togeth with ani cargo gene that genet engin may have attach to it .Becaus it is hard to chang the natur site at which a home endonucleas cut DNA , Dr. Burt propos gene drive system could not easili be put into practic . All that chang three year ago with the invent of Crispr-Cas9 gene edit . The techniqu is base on a natur system that evolv in bacteria as a defens against invad virus .The bacteria store DNA sampl from these invas virus in a DNA librari , call Crispr , that is part of their genom . When a viru attack , endonucleas such Cas9 ( Ca stand for Crispr-associ ) are prime by the Crispr librari to cut viral DNA of the same sequenc .After recov from their amaz that organ as small as bacteria possess an adapt immun system , biologist realiz that they could take over the Cas9 endonucleas and make it cut DNA at ani site of their choos by provid it with a synthet guid sequenc instead of one from the Crispr librari . The use of Crispr-Cas9 for genom edit wa first publish in 2012 by Jennif Doudna of the Univers of California , Berkeley , and Emmanuel Charpenti , now at the Max Planck Institut for Infect Biolog in Berlin . But Feng Zhang , of the Broad Institut in Cambridg , Mass. , wa the first to file a patent , which Berkeley lawyer are challeng .The Crispr-Cas9 techniqu give biologist unpreced power to edit DNA . With the abil to cut DNA at a specif site , they can let the cell DNA repair machineri past in new sequenc , usual a gene of interest , in the process of anneal the two cut end of the DNA molecul .In April , two biologist at the Univers of California , San Diego , Valentino M. Gantz and Ethan Bier , caus a stir with a gene drive system that carri a gene for albin into laboratori fruit fli . Their drive wa astonishingli effici : Within two gener , some 97 percent of the fruit fli had been render pale by the mutat . Although gene drive may not spread so quickli in natur popul , which are more variabl , the experi demonstr the vast potenti of the method for modifi pest popul .With the Crispr-Cas9 techniqu , laboratori all over the world , includ mani with no experi in confin potenti hazard organ , could now gener gene drive system . A flurri of articl urg caution began to appear from other biologist , who note that if a fruit fli with a gene drive system escap from a laboratori , it could affect fruit fli worldwid . In an articl in Scienc in August , Dr. Church and other recommend step for avoid accident releas , includ have more than one confin strategi . With strong safeguard , they wrote , we hope to build a foundat of public trust for potenti futur applications.A harder issu than contain is how to assess the ecolog effect of gene drive system . Even someth as appar benign as elimin mosquito could have ecolog effect becaus mosquito interact with other speci ,  said Kevin Esvelt , a biochemist at Harvard . Dr. Burt , howev , note in an interview that there are more than 800 speci of mosquito in Africa , and elimin the group of speci that carri malaria wa unlik to have a cascad effect ,  even though the possibl should be look at . Dr. Burt said he is also unabl to think of ani disadvantag to human or to mosquito in elimin the malaria parasit that prey on both .Anoth concern is that a gene drive system may have unintend consequ , by make it target speci more pathogen or by spread to other speci . A suggest approach to thi problem is to proceed in care stage , releas a gene drive system first in a cage popul of target insect , and then in an isol habitat like an island , if possibl , befor ani major releas into the wild .It may seem that onc a gene drive system is releas , it can never be recal . But thi may not be entir true . Biologist are work on the concept of revers drives and immun drives. A revers drive would cut out an errant drive and restor the target organ almost to it previou state . An immun drive would attack and pre-empt chang the DNA sequenc target by the rogu drive .A group of biologist propos last year that befor ani gene drive system is releas into the environ , it design should prepar a standbi revers drive . But critic suggest that the avail of revers drive might make peopl overconfid  and in ani case , they might not work as advertis .If your first drive doesnt work as intend , are you sure your second drive will work ?  Dr. Burt said .The power over natur that gene drive system promis is a respons that sure no biologist take lightli . But peopl alreadi exert control over natur with a slew of toxic pesticid and herbicid that are a heavi burden on the environ . Gene drive system offer a much more specif and less harm approach , at least in principl , toward attain the same goal .Risk asid , there is no guarante that gene drive will work as well in the field as they do in the laboratori . Wild popul of mosquito , say , may have much genet variat at the target site of a gene drive system . Those with a variant target site would escap the drive and might have a select advantag over it .Resist will aris , as to ani chang that reduc a species fit . But biologist could respond by releas mani drive into a wild popul , each assign to a differ target . Even if a drive come to domin a whole popul , biologist expect it will eventu be elimin by fitter gene . But a respons would be to keep releas new drive .I think well be abl to make thi work ,  Dr. Burt said .', 'Re A Lost Speci Crawl Back ( Dec. 15 ) :The ignor of the old-tim sailor is sad , but the geniu of modern scientist might balanc that out .

With fierc storm predict for the winter , they are brace for flood by stockpil sandbag and rush to buy insur .Yet those who need water the most , farmer , are in a poor posit to take advantag of ani delug . If El Nio flood pour into the Central Valley , the farmer will inevit watch million of gallon of water flow to the sea .Thi state , forward-look on other environment issu , ha been stymi for decad over how to upgrad it plumb system , an immens but age network of reservoir and canal that move water from the mountain north to the drier south .But the prolong drought of recent year ha prod California into action , with new law and a willing to spend public money to better prepar for a futur that is like to be more difficult becaus of climat chang . The state must decid how best to save the water that arriv between the drought year , weigh the valu of billion-dollar construct project against smaller and less expens measur .Wer see a level of attent and commit that we havent seen in decad , a desir to move forward ,  said Lester A . Snow , a former head of water resourc for California and veteran of the state water battl .Big decis loom . What part of California water system , the most elabor in the world , need fix the most ? And how can it be done in a way that help the state enorm farm economi , which use huge amount of water , without sacrif the need of it citi or the environ ?The path California choos will affect peopl across the Unit State and even around the world .In the 20th centuri , cheap and plenti water for irrig , coupl with rich soil and a special climat , turn the state into a cornucopia that ha stock the nation refriger and cupboard for gener . These day , farmer are also help to suppli develop countri like China with fruit and nut .But keep California agricultur land in product depend on fix it grow water problem .As the state consid it option , mani farmer want to reviv the approach that work for them in the last centuri : build dam . Not far from thi tini hamlet northeast of Fresno , for instanc , the govern is think of build a new artifici lake just abov an exist one .Wer in a critic condit right now ,  said Mario Santoyo , a board member and technic advis for the California Latino Water Coalit , as he stood on the deck of a motorboat in the middl of Millerton Lake , built in 1942 . He point to a spot call Temper Flat , where the new dam  it would be the latest of mani on the San Joaquin River  would be built .Yet , as agricultur interest prepar a major push to get water project built , doubt are grow about whether spend huge sum to pour high wall of concret are the best way to solv California water problem .Mani independ expert , and almost all environment group , argu that dam would suppli rel littl water for the money . They contend that Californian need to move aggress to more modern method of water manag , reduc wast to a minimum and learn to live within the limit impos by an arid environ .We are live with a legaci of decad of overalloc our water , and refus to say no when peopl want more ,  said Doug Obegi , a lawyer with the Natur Resourc Defens Council in San Francisco . When peopl think they are entitl to more water than exist in the system , that a recip for failure.California is abl to suppli a third of America veget and two-third of it fruit and nut becaus it is one of onli five major grow region of the world with what is known as a Mediterranean climat . That mean it is cold and wet in the winter , then dri and sunni in the summer . The bright , clear day creat ideal grow condit .The hitch is water . Precipit is errat , and when it come , it tend to fall in the mountain northern and eastern part of the state , while much of the popul and farm are in the south and west . Winter snow in the Sierra Nevada are crucial , send billion of gallon of water race down the state river with the spring snowmelt .In the mid-20th centuri , two enorm govern project  the feder Central Valley Project and the State Water Project  were built to captur those flow . They move water over hill and through desert , deliv it as far south as the San Diego neighborhood border Mexico .Much of the water is pump from the great delta where the Sacramento and San Joaquin River converg on their way to the ocean through the Golden Gate , and that pump ha becom a focu of intract conflict .In recent decad , the ecolog of the delta deterior to the verg of collaps , with mani of California nativ fish believ to be in danger of extinct . Scientist said that excess pump wa a contribut factor . Congress impos restrict that reduc water for farmer , and environment group su under the nation landmark conserv law to further tighten the rule .The extend drought ha compound the problem . Across larg part of the Central Valley , farmer have surviv by pump groundwat at a furiou rate , caus water tabl to drop precipit and thousand of shallow well to run dri .Public awar of the overpump allow Gov . Jerri Brown and other state leader to overcom decad of resist from the farm lobbi and pass a law last year to regul groundwat , though the law doe not requir the pump to be reduc to sustain level until the 2040 .Youv got a free-for-al for the next 25 year ,  said John D. Bredehoeft , a retir feder hydrologist in Sausalito who spent decad studi water in California . I dont think the water go to last for 25 years.As water problem have worsen in the Central Valley , mani farmer have blame the environmentalist who , the farmer argu , are choos to wast water on fish at the expens of peopl .Speak in Congress in Juli , Tom McClintock , a Republican Hous member who repres a larg section of the Central Valley , decri the nihilist vision of the environment left : increasingli sever government-induc shortag , forc ration , astronom water price and a perman declin qualiti of life for our children , who will be requir to stretch and ration everi drop of water in their parch homes.For peopl who share thi view , one propos solut is to overcom the polit power of the environmentalist and build more dam . When California voter , frighten by the drought , approv $ 7.12 billion in new bond last year to improv the water infrastructur , agricultur interest push to includ $ 2.7 billion for new water storag .Mani propos for new storag are on the tabl . Two that have drawn consider interest are dam the San Joaquin River again at Temper Flat , cost more than $ 2 billion , and a project north of the delta call Site Reservoir that would store water pump from the Sacramento River , at a cost near $ 4 billion .Yet , in part becaus California alreadi ha so mani dam and the best site were use up long ago , all that money would buy rel littl extra water , accord to expert who have studi the propos .Ellen Hanak , head of the water program at a think tank call the Public Polici Institut of California , calcul that if both project had been in place in time for the current drought , water suppli to the state farmer might have been increas by about 5 percent . I think peopl in agricultur imagin that it would do more than it would ,  Dr. Hanak said .Just as controversi is a huge plan push by Governor Brown to build two immens tunnel , at a cost of $ 15 billion , to move water from the upper reach of the delta to the lower delta , bypass some of the environment problem . The goal is to creat a more reliabl system , but delta farm group see the plan as an old-fashion water grab by the southern part of the state .On a boat ride in Juli through one of the delta channel , Anna Swenson , co-director of a commun group call North Delta Care , spoke of William Mulholland , the fame Lo Angel water boss who , in the earli 20th centuri , purloin the water of the distant Owen Valley on behalf of hi citi .William Mulholland is in the grave , and so should hi idea be ,  Ms. Swenson said . The day when you could come up here and stick your straw in to satisfi your insati demand  those day are over.Elsewher in the state , mani farm group support the tunnel plan , but other are wari , fear they will be stuck with a larg bill in exchang for minim benefit . Mr. Brown ha pledg to make water user , not taxpay , pay for the tunnel , but it is not clear whether he will be abl to pull togeth the financ .The econom of the propos dam are just as difficult . Farmer are not will to pay the full cost , and a huge battl is expect over how to spend the $ 2.7 billion approv by California voter for water-storag project .We should just be ruthless about thi ,  said Jay R. Lund , head of the Center for Watersh Scienc at the Univers of California , Davi . It a straight-up calcul : What the benefit to the peopl of California compar to the cost ? If you think your project is such a good project , prove it.For Don Cameron , a farmer south of Fresno , a wet winter 33 year ago led to an idea about how to take advantag of the vast natur water storag system underground . He notic that some grapevin along the San Joaquin River were flood for month in the winter , but that those same vine produc a lush crop of grape in the summer .He had to wait until 2011 , the last wet year befor the current drought , to act on hi idea . With a small govern grant and help from scientist and an environment group , Mr. Cameron divert water to a thousand acr of the farm he manag , Terranova Ranch , deliber flood field of grape , pistachio tree and hay .Convent wisdom among farmer held that the root of the crop , stand in floodwat for week on end , were like to rot . I think our neighbor thought we were crazi , to be honest with you ,  Mr. Cameron recal .But Mr. Cameron field suffer littl damag . And the water soak deep into the ground , help to recharg the underground suppli . Nowaday , Mr. Cameron is a man in demand , field telephon call and interview from around the state .It turn out that California alreadi ha a place to store immens amount of water , without necessarili build new dam .Decad of overpump have left the state water-bear format , known as aquif , with enorm spare capac . By some estim , California could pump 10 time as much water into the aquif as could be held by the new dam on the draw board .Such groundwat storag is alreadi occur in part of the state , mainli in urban area . It is not a perfect solut for agricultur : Water pump into the ground and then pull back out can pick up salt and other pollut .But no option confront California farmer is perfect . Expert say thi one ha the potenti to be far cheaper than dam . And if a new dam is built  at Temper Flat , say  it could potenti help suppli water for the aquifer-recharg project .The new groundwat law that the Legislatur pass last year would give farmer stronger incent to cooper in such plan . In wet year , they might allow their field to be flood in the winter or earli spring to recharg the groundwat , and they would then be entitl to pump a certain amount out in dri year .Now , urgent research is underway to figur out what soil and crop can toler deliber flood . To move floodwat around in the winter , new canal and other infrastructur may be need in some area , one potenti use of some of the $ 2.7 billion in public money .If flood come thi winter , Mr. Cameron will wish he were in a posit to go beyond hi 2011 experi , captur more water . But , like mani farmer , he doe not yet have the canal and gear in place to make that work , a big reason the farmer could be forc to watch million of gallon of floodwat escap to the sea thi winter .Over the long term , Dr. Hanak believ , the state should not onli encourag farmer to store water in the ground , but also consid creat a market to allow them to buy and sell their allot .Megan Konar , an engin at the Univers of Illinoi , Urbana-Champaign , is among the expert eager to see California lead the world toward more sustain method . Recent research she did with a graduat student , Landon Marston , found that 18.5 percent of the American grain suppli , an essenti link in the food chain , is come from part of the countri where the aquif are be deplet . Other research suggest that overpump of water is even more sever in part of India and Africa , a long-term risk to the global food suppli .As climat chang forc farmer to grow crop in hotter condit , water demand is onli go to rise .These aquif need to be seen as strateg nation reserv that can help us weather more climat variabl in the futur ,  Dr. Konar said . Right now , we have pretti much the opposit situat  wer just see rapid overexploitation.', 'In the Unit State the median age at which colon cancer strike is 69 for men and 73 for women .

Senior may also deliber discontinu drug when they dislik their side effect .But drug laps and error also occur becaus of problem that , in a more ration world , should be fairli simpl to address . Research and reform alreadi have come up with rel easi fix . The univers medic schedul : Instead of ask patient to deciph perplex label ( some still use Latin abbrevi , like TID for three time a day ) , label would set out four standard time  morn , noon , even , bedtim  for take drug .Nearli all drug can be made to fit into thi schedul , which could help patient group pill so they are less like to take unnecessarili frequent dose , skip them or just give up altogeth .At a Nation Institut of Health confer last month , Dr. Wolf and hi colleagu report on a trial ( not yet publish ) involv 845 patient in Northern Virginia . Those who receiv so-cal patient-cent label use the univers medic schedul  and larger type  made significantli fewer mistak while take their prescript .The biggest improv occur among patient at highest risk for nonadher : those with lower health literaci and those with more complex regimen .California began call for ( though not requir ) the univers medic schedul  along with simpler label in larger type  in 2011 , despit drug industri resist .

Our forebear began walk upright , and they lost much of their bodi hair ; they gain precision-grip finger and develop gigant brain .But earli human also may have evolv a less obviou but equal import advantag : a peculiar sleep pattern . It realli weird , compar to other primat ,  said Dr. David R. Samson , a senior research scientist at Duke Univers .In the journal Evolutionari Anthropolog , Dr. Samson and Dr. Charl L. Nunn , an evolutionari biologist at Duke , report that human sleep is except short and deep , a pattern that may have help give rise to our power mind .Until recent , scientist knew veri littl about how primat sleep . To document orangutan slumber , for exampl , Dr. Samson onc rig up infrar camera at the Indianapoli Zoo and stay up each night to watch the ape nod off .By observ their movement , he track when the orangutan fell in and out of REM sleep , in which human experi dream .I becam nocturn for about seven month ,  Dr. Samson said . It take someon who want to get their Ph.D. to be motiv enough to do that.In the new studi . Dr. Samson and Dr. Nunn combin that inform with studi of 19 other primat speci . The research found wide variat in how long the anim slept . Mous lemur doze for seventeen hour a day , for exampl , while human sleep just seven hour or so a day  the least of ani primat on the planet ,  said Dr. Samson .The scientist look for factor that could explain the differ . Compar with big mammal , for exampl , smaller speci tend to sleep more dure the day and in short bout , perhap becaus they need to eat mani time a day .Dr. Samson and Dr. Nunn found that the time each primat speci spend asleep gener correspond to it physic size , along with other factor , such as the averag number of primat in a group .The one big except : human . We sleep a lot less than one would predict base on the pattern seen in other primat .From time to time while sleep , we slip into REM sleep and dream . All told , we spend about 22 percent of sleep in REM , the highest ratio of REM to total sleep in ani primat , the research report .Dr. Samson and Dr. Nunn have an explan for how human end up sleep so littl , and so often in REM .Over ten of million of year , they assert , chang in our ancestors ecolog drove the evolut of new sleep pattern . Human increasingli have been abl to achiev a good night sleep .A number of studi suggest that REM sleep benefit the brain . Some scientist argu that it sweep out molecular debri , and other say it consolid new memori into last impress .But it wa not easi for our monkey-lik ancestor to reach REM sleep . They slept on branch , and their night were anyth but easi . As monkey tri to sleep today , they get rous by wind , tree snake and the jostl of their fellow primat .It like economi class on a plane ,  said Dr. Samson . Monkey , he believ , have to rest longer to get the benefit of REM sleep .The fossil record suggest that 20 million year ago , the ancestor of human and other ape chang their sleep habit becaus they becam too big for branch . Today , no primat that weigh over 60 pound sleep on a branch . Instead , chimpanze , bonobo and their cousin build sleep platform each night from stick and other materi .Dr. Samson and hi colleagu have found that ape take great care in choos tree to sleep in and the materi to build their platform . The reason , he suspect , is that ape aim to get the best night rest they can .Dr. Samson and the primatologist Robert W. Shumak found that orangutan that got to make platform of foam and other comfort materi score better on cognit test the follow day than ape that slept on straw .Earli human ancestor probabl continu to sleep in tree until about two million year ago , Dr. Samson said . By 1.8 million year ago , new hominin like Homo erectu had left the tree . I think we can be safe in say Homo erectu slept on the ground ,  Dr. Samson said .Earli human probabl slept around fire in larg group , abl to ward off predat . The result , said Dr. Samson and Dr. Nunn , wa the chanc to get an even better night rest . Human were abl to fall more soundli asleep and to experi deeper bout of REM sleep .Sinc it took less time to get the benefit of REM sleep , human were abl to get by with less sleep over all than other primat . They gain a few extra wake hour each day , which they might have use to make new tool or share stori .Dr. Patrick J. McNamara , a neurologist at Boston Univers School of Medicin , found the new studi compel . We as a speci have found a way to get more out of a shorter sleep span than other speci ,  he said .But he and other scientist also said that the studi rais mani puzzl question .Dr. Robert A. Barton , an evolutionari biologist at Durham Univers in the Unit Kingdom , note that mous lemur are so tini that they can sleep insid tree caviti . They ought to be abl to enjoy short , effici sleep as we do , but instead they are marathon dozer .While our REM sleep may be unusu among primat , it is not so special among mammal . The platypu is the champion ,  said Dr. Jerom M. Siegel , a sleep research at the Univers of California , Lo Angel . That creatur spend half of it sleep in REM .Dr. Samson repli that the evolut of sleep may be driven by differ factor in differ group of speci . Figur out what those factor are will take mani more sleepless night of research .These first studi are realli excit indic that someth realli profound is go on here ,  he said , but I think the jury still out.', 'Each year , the field of fluid dynam , as mathemat demand and challeng to the nonscientist as ani field of physic , produc some of the most compel and beauti video .That partli becaus of the abil of modern technolog to captur motion and movement we wouldnt see with the nake eye .

Fire in the tropic . Flood in the southern Unit State . Unseason warm weather on the Eastern Seaboard . All have follow El Nio event in past year .The recur meteorolog phenomenon form again in 2015 , and , accord to Martin Hoerl , a research meteorologist at the Nation Ocean and Atmospher Administr , it is rank up with the biggest in the histor record that we have.What caus El Nio ?To understand El Nio , it use to rememb some basic geographi . Pictur the equatori Pacif , the larg stretch of ocean with South Asia and Australia to the west , and South America to the east .The Pacif trade wind that blow over the region usual move from east to west , push the water at the ocean surfac toward South Asia and Australia . As the warmest water evapor , the air fill with moistur and contribut to the monsoon season in Asia and Australia .El Nio occur when the trade wind stop move . Scientist have been unabl to immedi pinpoint the caus of thi shift . A varieti of factor can start the cycl in motion at ani given time ,  Mr. Hoerl said . In ani given El Nio , sometim after the fact it becom evid which precursor seem to tip the balance.He ad : But onc these condit begin to unfold , they go through a life cycl that last on the order of 12 month or so , and there a lot of predict in that.El Nio event typic occur everi two to seven year . The current event wa identifi about six month ago , though scientist are not yet sure what caus it .What are the effect of El Nio ?Scientist do know what happen after the wind stop blow . The weather revers : Australia and South Asia experi drought instead of rain , and the Pacif Coast of South America is drench by a raini season . The path of other wind , known as jet stream , are alter . One of them drive Pacif storm to California .Strong El Nio event deliv heavi rain to California ( Mr. Hoerl predict that those could arriv thi month ) , and push warm air across the northern Unit State and Canada , which help to explain the current unseason warmth on the East Coast .Outsid the Unit State , rain increas along the equatori Pacif , which mean that normal arid region such as the Galpago get quit wet . A weak Atlant hurrican season , like the one thi summer , also tend to follow El Nio . And the typhoon season in the tropic west Pacif tend to becom veri activ becaus the warm ocean spawn more atmospher disturb that can develop into storm .Notabl effect link to the 2015 event includ drought in Indonesia , which contribut to extens wildfir in the countri . ( A similar effect wa caus by the last strong El Nio . ) Typhoon Melor , which prompt the evacu of thousand in the Philippin , is also consist with the effect seen dure past El Nio .Whi is it call El Nio ?Accord to NASA , fishermen in Latin America recogn that they usual saw the effect of the phenomenon close to Christma . El Nio , which mean the boy in Spanish , refer to the birth of Christ . ( Though for some , it will alway be associ with Chri Farley ) .Is El Nio caus by climat chang ?Evid suggest that El Nio ha been happen for thousand of year . That said , three of the strongest event in the histor record , which goe back about 120 year , have taken place in the last 30 year . Mr. Hoerl said that the question of climat chang caus stronger event is be research .Is El Nio good or bad ?Neither . It weather .Becaus the phenomenon ha been recur for so long , it is built into ecosystem around the world . Mr. Hoerl point out that some area that never get rain , onli get rain in thi phenomenon . It a veri import climat featur of those regions. He point to part of California and the Southwestern Unit State , where the rain deliv by El Nio is essenti to the ecolog .At the same time , El Nio can caus typhoon , rainstorm and drought . So while the phenomenon can not necessarili be categor as posit or neg , it can have advers effect on human popul that are best combat by understand El Nio as well as we can .

And so what next for them ?Bill McKibben , co-found of the climat activ group 350.org , post photo after photo from Pari from hi Twitter account celebr the march and protest after the deal , and wrote : Thi agreement wont save the planet . It may have save the chanc to save the planet ( if we all fight like hell in the year ahead ) .In an interview via email , Mr. McKibben said that the environment movement would be support of the Pari plan , but would expect to see result . Well take them at their word , at least for now , and ask them to prove it ,  he said .The focu of activ will shift , he ad , to ensur that the state goal of allow temperatur to rise no more than 2 degre Celsiu , or even 1.5 , is taken serious by govern .Hi group spearhead opposit to build the Keyston XL oil pipelin . After Pari , he said , There a long list of thing that they cant build go forward. The group will continu to focu on govern polici and practic with a goal to keep it in the ground ,  the motto about fossil fuel that 350.org popular .Youd have to end fossil fuel subsidi tomorrow , and not even think about lift the oil export ban ,  he wrote . Offshor drill ? Forget it . Leas coal in the Powder River Basin ? No dice . And the same stori all over the world.I think it go to be highli energ for the climat movement ,  Mr. McKibben said .The spread of worldwid advocaci over climat issu ha been remark rapid . Activist have march in group number in the hundr of thousand and dangl from a bridg to block an icebreak head to the Arctic for oil explor .A push that began just a few year ago on colleg campus to urg institut to remov fossil fuel stock from their invest ha grown into an intern movement , with Norway sovereign wealth fund and the Church of England among institut that have drop coal or all fossil fuel from portfolio control an estim $ 3.4 trillion in total asset .The campu protest continu . Student at the Massachusett Institut of Technolog have spent more than 50 day engag in a sit-in at the offic of the school presid to protest the institution refus of student divest demand .The climat accord from Pari doe not chang the need to protest , said Geoffrey J. Supran , a graduat student and leader of Fossil Free M.I.T . Between homework and lab work , sore back and tire eye , trust me , none of us want to be here ,  he said . But our administr ha left us no choice.The divest movement , he ad , i help to refram the climat chang narr at the highest level ,  and the influenc is reciproc . The promis made at Pari not onli vindic our movement , they light a fire under it.But perhap the center of action will shift , said Tom Steyer , the hedg fund billionair who ha becom a major climat activist and Democrat donor .He spent a week in Pari dure the talk and said that what impress him the most wa not just the histor agreement among the nation of the world , but the addit commit from region and local officehold , led in part by Gov . Jerri Brown of California and former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York , and from major busi and donor like Bill Gate , who announc a billion-dollar clean energi fund at the talk .I am total support and admir and respect of the protest ,  Mr. Steyer said , ad that he believ they have a continu role to play . But the fight against climat chang now shift from the activist commun to peopl do thing in the real world ,  he said .Bob Massi , execut director of the Sustain Solut Lab , a new initi at the Univers of Massachusett , Boston , said that there wa still more than enough for the movement to do  especi in the Unit State , where much of the leadership of one of the nation two major polit parti still deni that climat chang is even occur .We have thi Congress , run by the polit wing of the Flat Earth Societi ,  he joke . With the global deal in Pari , he said , American lawmak are now total disconnect from the rest of the world. State offici are fight the administration Clean Power Plan in court .Mr. Massi , who ha been deepli involv in the divest movement , said that activist would continu to push at the feder , state and local level , where attempt to adapt citi for come effect of climat chang will be increasingli import .If a Republican is elect presid , he said , there will realli be noth from the feds to advanc climat goal , and you will have a two-tier system or three-tier system , with one tier ignor thi and anoth tier move forward.The institut that have taken part in the divest push will remain activ as well , said Ellen Dorsey , execut director of the Wallac Global Fund and a leader of the effort . She call the agreement in Pari an epoch win that will eventu render fossil fuel a antiqu as the Polaroid , the hors and buggi and chattel slavery.It will spur more effort , not less , from the activist commun , she said .The movement that help pave the way for an agreement in Pari , the movement call for divest from fossil fuel , must keep it foot on the acceler ,  Dr. Dorsey ad . Activist must still challeng the industri and it power to ensur near-term implement of the agreement , while demand dramat invest in clean and safe energi access for the world majority.Mr. McKibben said he did not expect the pace to let up anytim soon .It definit the right project to pick ,  he said , if your goal is someth to keep you occupi for a lifetime.', 'TO THE EDITOR :Re Artifici Friend for the Aging ( Dec. 8 ) : As a retir geriatr social worker , I am familiar with all the issu thi articl mention .

The devic are expens : $ 10,000 for a mechan lift , for instanc , and $ 5,000 for an extra-wid bed .It realli not a moneymak ,  said Aundrea Fuller , an owner of Gener of Red Bay , the privat , for-profit facil that care for Ms. Chism in a special outfit wing that can accommod 10 obes patient . Ms. Fuller decis to open the unit , which frequent ha a wait list , fulfil her person mission to aid obes peopl , who are often ostrac and forgotten . But it make littl busi sens .Youv got to do it becaus you have a heart for it ,  she said .There is no nation censu of avail bed in American nurs home for those weigh more than 350 pound , the maximum weight a standard hospit bed can handl . But industri group and research say facil rare accept more than a few markedli obes patient .Genesi HealthCar , one of the nation largest nursing-hom chain , recent close it much laud bariatr care program . Nurs expert consid it a model for safe handl of obes patient .One or two place that have tri to do it recogn the econom just dont work ,  said Dr. David Gifford , the senior vice presid of qualiti and regulatori affair at the American Health Care Associ , an industri trade group .As a result , nurs home across the countri are routin declin referr from hospit seek to transfer obes patient , creat dilemma for hospit staff member task with safe discharg those readi to leav .The problem is especi acut in the South , where obes rate first skyrocket decad ago and extrem obes  a 40 B.M.I . and abov  continu to rise .Thi is definit not my grandmother elderli popul ,  said Juli Locher , a medic sociologist at the Univers of Alabama at Birmingham . Thi is a total differ cohort that is age now.In neighbor Mississippi , where 29 percent of peopl 65 and over are obes , nurs home that accept heavi resid are few and far between , said Sandra Terra , an administr at the Univers of Mississippi Medic Center in Jackson . Nineti percent of the nurs facil to which her hospit routin discharg patient wont have anyth to do with obes patient , she said .The delay are exasper and commonplac . It not uncommon to make 30 or 40 referr to final find a placement ,  said Barbara Miller , the director of case manag at the Univers of Arkansa for Medic Scienc , an academ health center with a hospit and clinic in Littl Rock .Whether these routin denial violat anti-discrimin law is unclear , especi becaus the degre to which obes is a legal protect disabl remain unsettl . Industri specialist argu the law is unambigu .Nurs home arent requir , like emerg room , to admit patient , so they have a lot of latitud ,  said David Grabowski , a professor of health care polici at Harvard Medic School .But some expert argu that sever obes patient with signific physic impair could challeng their denial .That what the American With Disabl Act is meant to protect against ,  said Eric Carlson , a lawyer for Justic in Age , a legal advocaci group .Legal expert say the question is far from settl , but in at least one instanc , a sever obes patient who wa deni admiss to a nurs home file a discrimin complaint through the feder Offic for Civil Right . To resolv the issu , the nurs home , the GlenShir Nurs and Rehabilit Center in Illinoi , admit the patient and provid an extra-wid dialysi chair .The reluct to accept hospit referr , especi when physic therapi or wound care is need , come down to practic matter : How mani staff member will it take to turn the patient ? Where is the wound ? How long will physic therapi take ?We ask them , What is the barrier ? ,  said Akofa Bonsi-Wallac , the former director of discharg plan at the Univers of Alabama at Birmingham hospit , who often reach out to nurs home in Georgia , Florida and Tennesse . Most of the time it staf . Wev heard , I alreadi have a morbidli obes patient , and they are eat away at my staf hours.At the Gener of Red Bay facil , nurs reposit obes resid like Ms. Chism , who are unabl to move on their own , everi few hour to avoid danger pressur ulcer . Daili person need requir monument coordin . One nurs can help a resid of normal weight dress and sit in a chair within 15 minut , said Kathi McCurri , head treatment nurs . With a bariatr patient , that take an hour with two certifi nurs assistants.There are other reason nurs home are wari , includ the inabl to transport such patient to the emerg room , the possibl of staff injuri and higher workers compens cost , and the infeas of remodel older build with wider door frame and special plumb to accommod sturdier toilet .The pauciti of avail bed ha meant heavi patient can languish in hospit , at great expens to Medicar , privat insur compani and the hospit .Wev had patient in the hospit for sever month ,  said Dr. Lynn Crawford , the medic director of the Univers of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital-Highland geriatr unit  an observ echo by other hospit and nation industri group .Martin Bayn , 65 , who ha Parkinson diseas and weigh 370 pound , found himself stuck in a hospit in Pennsylvania after episod of congest heart failur and the flu . It wa hell for me ,  he said , lament the helpless and humili he felt await placement in a skill nurs facil .There a terribl feel that goe along with know that your not want ,  said Mr. Bayn , an advoc and blogger on issu of age . He now live in a person care home in Center Valley , Pa .Patient can end up in nurs home hour away , and across state line , from their famili , compound a difficult period of their live . They are alreadi ill and feel compromis ,  Ms. Terra , of the Univers of Mississippi Medic Center , said . But at some point , we have to say : It ha to do with your weight . I cant find a place for you to go.By 2040 , more than 82 million peopl will be 65 and older , twice as mani as in 2000 . Adult obes ha continu to increas  38 percent of American 60 and older are obes  and one in 20 adult is consid extrem obes .As ten of million of these obes American age , Dr. Crawford said , it go to be exponenti worse.Nurs home administr say they also have to accommod a number of younger obes patient with seriou health problem who are unabl to live on their own . Lee Nall , 28 , slouch in a wheelchair in hi room in the bariatr wing at Gener of Red Bay . A diabet who ha been sever obes sinc childhood , Mr. Nall had suffer a stroke that left hi right side paralyz . Through physic therapi , he said , he is hope to recov and have a life outsid of here.Hospit have becom increasingli invent , with some offer donat of special bed , mattress and lift to nurs home consid admiss of an obes patient . We step in to tri to help with that transit ,  Ms. Bonsi-Wallac said .The prospect of lose weight is neither realist nor advis for these patient , doctor say .The expect ha been that wer go to get them back up on their feet and get them home again ,  said Ms. Phillip of LeadingAg . But there is a group of them that is not go to happen . And lose weight at thi point in their life is not a viabl option.Inde , weight loss can be danger for obes patient who , despit their size , lose muscl mass and can becom frail , place them at risk for fractur .For Wanda Chism , her golden year have play out far differ than she imagin . I alway pictur my retir : I want a tricycl and be on my way.Instead , she seem resign that she will be in her small room and overs bed at the obes wing at Gener of Red Bay until the end .She survey the odd and end of fabric spill out of her plastic sew bin and the call buzzer and TV remot she use to summon the outsid world .It home ,  she said , nod . It home.', 'For decad Evelyn M. Witkin , professor emerita at Rutger Univers , ha been a tower figur in genet . Recent she wa award the Lasker Basic Medic Research Award for groundbreak work into how DNA respond to damag , a process essenti to all live organ .At 94 , Dr. Witkin own DNA appear to be in excel condit . We met at her townhous not far from Princeton Univers . A condens and edit version of that interview and a subsequ telephon convers follow .Q . When you were grow up in 1930 New York , what did you think youd be do with your life ?A. I thought I might becom a biologist . Genet wasnt a separ field of studi yet .As an N.Y.U . undergradu , I major in biolog ; howev , in my senior year , which wa 1940 , I join a civil-right protest . That chang the direct of my life .Though N.Y.U . had black on sport team , when the school went up against some univers in the South , they kept them home . Seven student leader , myself includ , circul a petit protest N.Y.U. accept of Southern racism . N.Y.U . respond by suspend us for three month . I could not graduat with my class . I lost the graduat assistantship theyd offer me for the follow year .So I went up to Columbia , walk into Theodosiu Dobzhansky offic and ask if I might studi with him . Hed never had a femal graduat student befor and thought that would be pretti good , and he said , Sure.Whi did you go to Dobzhanski , a founder of evolutionari genet ?To be frank , it wa becaus Professor Dobzhanski wa Russian . I wa interest in test the theori of Trofim Lysenko , who assert that gene didnt exist . I thought Dobzhanski could read Lysenko in the origin . Now , onc I took Dobzhansky genet class , I saw that Lysenko wa a fraud or an ignoramu , or both .One day in 1943 , Professor Dobzhanski gave me an articl by Salvador Luria and Max Delbruck prove for the first time that bacteria had gene . Report on it for Dobzhansky class , I jump up and down with excit . At the time , one of the big question involv how genet mutat occur . Thank to Luria and Delbruck , I now saw how we could use bacteria model to answer that .So in the summer of 1944 , Dobzhanski sent me to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratori , where he had connect and where they were pioneer bacteri genet . I end up stay until 1955 .Legend ha it that on your first day there you made a signific discoveri . True ?Ye . On my first day , my supervisor hand me a cultur of E. coli bacteria , point to an ultraviolet lamp and said , Go induc mutations.I took a million bacteria , place them on petri dish , and put them under ultraviolet lamp . When I came back the next morn , there wa almost noth left aliv . The UV light dose appar had been too strong . Howev , one petri dish had four coloni on it , which meant that four bacteria had surviv what had kill everybodi els .At thi point , I ask , Whi did they surviv ? Mayb a mutat made them resistant.I next cultur and test them . Sure enough , they could withstand 100 time more radiat than the parent strain . That creat someth of a splash among scientist at Cold Spring Harbor . It becam the focu of my Ph.D. research and led to work that I and other did later on how DNA repair itself .What did you discov ?That DNA damag gener a signal that turn on a whole lot of other gene that are not activ in the healthi cell . They dont do anyth unless the cell gener thi S.O. . signal . And when they are turn on , they make product that help cell surviv . They repair damag .Now , my co-winn of the Lasker Prize , Stephen Elledg , later pick up on what I found and appli it to higher organ , includ human . It one connect stori that couldnt have been understood unless it had been work out in bacteria first .Your career began in a time when there were tremend barrier against women enter the scienc . How were you abl to do it ?I think it , in part , wa becaus I had a lot of support from men .My late husband , Herman Witkin , an experiment psychologist , wa a real feminist . He believ my career wa as import as hi . For 10 year , he commut four hour everi day to hi work in Brooklyn so that I could keep mine at Cold Spring Harbor . When our second child wa an infant , he had a sabbat . He wrote a book with the babi in hi lap most of the time .He love be home with the children that year . He said he got so close to those kid and that it wa the best thing ever .Some time in the 1950 , Vannevar Bush , whod head the Carnegi Institut of Washington  Cold Spring Harbor laboratori wa it depart of genet  sent hi college-ag granddaught to talk to me about famili and career . The secret ,  I told her , i to have a husband like Herman Witkin and boss like Vannevar Bush.How exactli wa Bush help ?When I wa pregnant with my first child , he came to my lab and said it wa import to make scientif career possibl for women . What did I need ? I told him , matern leav and to return onli part time . He said , Done , and wer not go to cut your salari becaus I know your go to do a full-tim job. That act alon made it possibl for me to stay with my research .Bush also wa veri support of Barbara McClintock . Befor come to Cold Spring Harbor , shed had all the classic women in science experi . Shed been a member of a graduat team at Cornel of three men . They got top-notch job as soon as they got their Ph.D. . Barbara couldnt .She won the Nobel Prize for the work she did there . Were you friend ?Ye . She taught me to realli get to know my bacteria . She had thi belief that you had to have a feel for the organ . I knew what she meant . You need to get deep down with these bug , get to know what goe on with them so that you could spot someth unusu .Whi , in 1955 , did you leav the research paradis that wa Cold Spring Harbor ?Becaus it wa bad for our famili to have Herman commut four hour daili . I move my work to Downstat Medic Center in Brooklyn . Veri earli , I made a decis that if there wa conflict between my work and famili , the famili came first .In 1960 we both had sabbat to Pari . When Franoi Jacob heard , he ask me to come work with him at the Pasteur . I turn him down becaus you dont work with Jacob unless you use everi cylind youv got . My children were 8 and 11 . They were go to be in a strang countri , in a strang school . I couldnt do it .When the Nobel Prize in Chemistri wa award thi year , it went to research who had work on DNA repair . Were you disappoint not to be includ ?That an awkward question . I can imagin that reader who do not know me will not believ me , but I couldnt have been disappoint becaus it never occur to me that I would get a Lasker Award , let alon a Nobel .', 'On Jan. 2 , 1966 , The New York Time publish a long articl about American car companies respons to the grow public concern about safeti . At the time , car had few safeti devic  shoulder har will probabl not be standard on 1967 model ,  the articl said . The automak are convinc that scarc anyon want them.Nevertheless , the report wrote , automak were begin to studi new equip . One of the most exot system under discuss is an air-bag arrang that would rapidli expand and hold passeng in place the instant a collis occurred. It wa the first mention in The Time of the automobil airbag .Ten day later , the newspap publish an articl titl Scientist Design Safeti Car to Cut Death Rate. An illustr depict a car with , among other innov , front and side airbag , lap and shoulder belt , a collaps steer wheel , an energy-absorb frame and a safeti tail-light flash system.But the report made clear that all thi wa still scienc fiction . Detroit had experi with the airbag , he wrote , but actual , engin there consid it  and inde a safeti car ,  as well  as be rather far off in the futur , if not downright improbable.On May 18 , 1969 , an articl quot Robert Carter , the leader of the Nation Motor Vehicl Safeti Advisori Council , predict that airbag could be incorpor in all car , in front and rear seat , by the fall of 1973 or even earlier .Mr. Carter wa wildli optimist . Figur out how to make an airbag work wa not easi . On Aug. 29 , 1969 , The Time report , Ford arrang an airbag demonstr with a new candy-appl red Galaxi in front of the Commerc Depart build in Washington . With report watch and camera roll , Ford public-rel expert push the button to show the airbag in action .Noth happen . He push again . Still noth . Someth must be defect ,  he said . The report note that hi competitor chuckl , the cameramen grumbl , and tourist wonder what wa go on .Nevertheless , other manufactur were get on board . On Jan. 15 , 1970 , The Time report that the presid of Gener Motor endors the idea , but said technic problem with it were still unresolv .They took a while to fix . It wa 18 year later , on May 26 , 1988 , that The Time report that The Chrysler Corporation decis to instal airbag as standard equip on sever car line thi year and all it domest made car by 1990 signal the end of a nearli 20-year battl over use of the devices.', 'The dodo is dead . The passeng pigeon ha pass on . But Lonesom Georg , the icon Galpago tortois whose death mark the end of hi speci , is in post-mortem luck .A scientif expedit ha discov some of hi close blood relat aliv and well . With care breed , biologist now hope to reviv George speci and reintroduc the tortois to the island on which they evolv .It would be a signal achiev in a place that gave rise to our understand of evolut and speciat .Origin there were at least eight speci of Galpago tortois , scientist now believ . ( One wa discov onli thi year . ) At least three speci are now extinct , includ tortois on Pinta Island . The last one , Georg , wa discov wander alon in 1972 and taken into love custodi . Hi death , in 2012 at more than 100 year old , wa a power remind of the havoc visit by human on delic ecosystem worldwid over the last two centuri .Tortois number plummet from more than 250,000 in the 16th centuri to a low of around 3,000 in the 1970 . In the 19th centuri , whaler , pirat and other seafar pluck the anim from their nativ island for use as ballast and food on long journey . Tortois can live in a ship hold for more than a year without food or water , make them the perfect takeaway meal .There are two type of Galpago tortois : saddleback and dome . The sailor much prefer the smaller saddleback , which were easier to lug around and said to tast better . They were also easier to find : Dome tortois live at higher elev and can weigh 300 pound . Saddleback evolv at lower elev and feed on drier veget .Saddleback tortois disappear from Santa Fe Island and Floreana Island , a favorit hangout for sailor post letter for other ship to carri home . With George death , the Pinta were gone , too .But now the stori of extinct Galpago tortois ha taken a strang , and hope , twist .More than a centuri ago , it turn out , sailor dump saddleback tortois they did not need into Bank Bay , near Wolf Volcano on Isabela Island . Luckili , tortois can extend their neck abov water and float on their back . Mani of them made it to shore , lumber across the lava field and interbr with Isabela nativ dome tortois .In 2008 , scientist tag and collect blood sampl from more than 1,600 tortois live on the flank of the volcano . Back in the laboratori , there wa a genet eureka : Eighty-nin of the anim were part Floreana , whose full genet profil DNA had been obtain from museum sampl .Some had gene indic their parent were live purebr Floreana tortois , hint that the speci may not be extinct after all .Seventeen tortois were shown to have high level of Pinta DNA . Tortois can live for more than 150 year , so some of them may well be George immedi next of kin .Last month , scientist went back to find them . Their plan wa to captur and separ tortois with high level of Pinta and Floreana DNA , and then breed anim that are genet closest to the origin speci .In just a few gener , it should be possibl to obtain tortois with 95 percent of their lost ancestr gene , the scientist said .The size of thi popul is mind-boggl ,  said Adalgisa Caccon , a senior research scientist at Yale Univers and the expedition geneticist , said of the Wolf tortois . I am optimist that some of these anim will have high conserv value.Genet is increasingli a key compon of conserv manag worldwid , said Dr. Linda Cayot , scienc advis for the Galpago Conserv , which help sponsor the expedit with the Galpago Nation Park Servic .But thi is the first time that genet inform ha been use so determinedli ,  she said , to manag a speci and it environ .With captiv breed and luck , new popul of tortois could be releas on Pinta and Floreana Island in five to 10 year , help to restor their lost ecosystem , Dr. Cayot said . Becaus tortois cruis close to the ground , they dispers seed and other nutrient that keep the land healthi .The expedit to Wolf Volcano occur over the last 10 day of Novemb under the direct of Jame P. Gibb , a professor of vertebr conserv at the State Univers of New York in Syracus . Nine three-person team were deploy over a 20-square-mil area .It wa rough go , with razor-sharp lava underfoot , and tick and wasp all around .The team were look for tortois with the most promin saddleback : shell rise up in front , like saddl , to accommod the animals extrem long neck for graze on tall cactus . The hope is that anim with characterist shell will have the highest level of Pinta and Floreana DNA .Two team found hot spots of saddleback at the southern end of the search area with low-li , dri veget , Dr. Gibb said . The best specimen were captur rel close to one anoth .The pattern is remark , Dr. Gibb said . After be jettison into Bank Bay more than a centuri ago , the saddleback have not move more than a few mile . They found food and water , so whi bother ?In all , the expedit discov more than 100 giant tortois that share George distinct saddleback shape . When a team captur a tortois with an ideal saddleback , they call the expedition ship , anchor in Bank Bay . A helicopt then fetch the anim in a cargo net .Scientist took 32 tortois with the most spectacular saddl to a breed center on Santa Cruz Island . The captur tortois includ 21 femal and 11 male , each weigh 100 to 300 pound . Most appear to be 30 to 40 year old , Dr. Gibb said , though a few could be much , much older .Seven of the anim tag and analyz in 2008 were retriev  one male and one femal with Pinta DNA , and one male and four femal with Floreana gene . We are plan to go back next year to look for more ,  Dr. Gibb said .Today , the femal tortois are hous in Lonesom George corral . The male are next door in a tourist pen .They are veri busi , veri happi , explor and do aggress display ,  Dr. Caccon said . Male stand on three leg , neck rais as high as they can go , and hiss at each other.The next step is to analyz each animal DNA to separ the two speci and find those with the least mix ancestri . Then the breed program can begin .If I had the money and peopl , it would take me a month to do the analysi , said Dr. Caccon , note the expedition tight budget . Realist , she said , it may take a year or more .One of the male is a doppelgang for Lonesom Georg , said Elizabeth Hunter , a postdoctor research on the expedit from the Univers of Georgia . When first captur , he rais himself up in a classic Georg pose .He is now show off for tourist , just like the old Georg .', 'Prairi vole are small Midwestern rodent known for monogam behavior .

The studi appear in the journal Scienc .Gener , anim neuroscientist believ that natur select minim genet variat . In thi case , howev , one mate strategi doe not seem to be more success than the other .Monogam male stay near their nest , which ensur that femal mate remain faith . Promiscu male have more partner , but they also lose sight of their own mate .When you roam , your own femal is free to mate with whoever she want ,  said Steven M.

Over nearli two month , at least 1,500 dog fell ill , mani for as long as three week . At least eight die from secondari infect like pneumonia .Initi , veterinarian thought they were see an outbreak of canin influenza , caus by a mutat of H3N8 , an equin viru . But these dog were much sicker for much longer , and the ill seem more contagi , race through doggi day care center , dog park and especi board kennel , which had been fill for the spring holiday .Eventu virologist identifi it as a new strain of canin influenza . Thi one is a mutat of avian flu , H3N2 , which had previous been document onli in Asia . Sinc the Chicago outbreak , scatter of case have been report in 25 state , with more signific outbreak in and around Atlanta and Cincinnati .Now , a vaccin for canin influenza viru H3N2 ha receiv condit approv from the Unit State Depart of Agricultur , which expedit licens in emerg situat to avert epidem . As the holiday travel season approach , the question is : Should you get your dog vaccin ?Thi is not an essenti vaccin , like the rabi seri . The mortal rate of thi flu ha been low , although the rate of morbid  the likelihood of a carrier becom sick  is high . Within a week of get the viru , about 80 percent of dog do becom ill. All are contagi .Edward J. Dubovi , a professor of virolog at Cornel University Colleg of Veterinari Medicin who help identifi the strain , estim that infect dog produc about 100 time more of thi viru than H3N8 canin influenza , and for much longer  up to 21 day .Veterinarian are like to base recommend in part on a dog lifestyl . Doe the dog go to day care or a dog park ? When owner travel , do they board their dog in kennel ?If your dog is in competit for dog show or get groom everi week , I would consid the vaccin more strongli ,  said Dr. Jerri Klein , chief veterinari offic for the American Kennel Club . But I tell anyon , onli vaccin dog that are complet healthi and have no underli disease.Anoth consider may be whether case have been report local . Dr. Bruce R. Coston , a spokesman for the American Veterinari Medic Associ , practic in rural Woodstock , Va. We havent had report , so Im not recommend the vaccin for my patient ,  he said .But an accur pictur of the spread is difficult to determin . Report of canin influenza viru is not mandatori . Mani veterinarian do not order test for it , becaus of the cost and becaus the treatment , which begin immedi , is similar to that of other canin respiratori virus : hydrat , rest , cough suppress and monitor for secondari infect .Owner , who may resist give their dog numer vaccin , will also weigh the cost and inconveni . Made by both Merck Anim Health and Zoeti , the initi dose are two shot , sever week apart . If full licens is grant next year , an annual booster will be recommend . A Zoeti spokeswoman said the price , set by individu veterinarian , will most like be $ 25 to $ 35 for each inject . Although a vaccin for canin influenza HN38 ha been approv sinc 2009 , no plan have been announc for a combin vaccin .The viru becom airborn as dog cough and lick each other or human . Peopl can not get sick from it but can easili pass on the viru by touch other dog , or surfac such as dog bowl and leash . Onli a hand of cat have contract it .The vaccin protect dog , but doe not give complet immun . It sharpli reduc the degre to which a dog may get sick , or is contagi . Dr. Eileen C. Ball , a veterinarian with Zoeti , said that becaus the flu is new and almost no dog have antibodi to fight it , it can spread unchecked. With the vaccin , she ad , we can stop a sever viru from move through the population.Dr. Klein saw first-hand the miseri and havoc creat by the outbreak . At it peak , the Chicago Veterinari Emerg and Specialti Center , now MedVet Chicago , where he is the supervis veterinarian , wa see 20 new case daili . Dog had to be admit outsid the facil , which set asid two exam room that requir complet disinfect after each canin visit . Some dog had to be hospit for nearli a week . The center sometim ran out of space and had to send dog to other anim clinic .We were all exhaust ,  Dr. Klein said . Id never work so hard in 35 years.As a precaut , he refrain from send hi Afghan hound to the groomer for two month .For dog owner , nonessenti vaccin is a subject matter . If the vaccin is distribut in Ithaca , N.Y. , Dr. Dubovi of Cornel said he would consid mani factor when decid about hi 13-year-old cockapoo , Chelsea .But one factor is more pronounc .I will probabl cave in to my wife ,  he said .

Schutziu , Stefan Jung , Dimo Poulikako and other research at ETH Zurich , a scienc and technolog univers , did low-pressur experi becaus of their interest in de-ic airplan wing .The levit droplet experi may seem a bit of a stretch , but their interest lie in the behavior of water under differ circumst on what are call superhydrophob materi .

The team analysi conclud that the lower pressur enhanc evapor from the water droplet . Most of the water vapor dissip into the chamber .But becaus of the textur of the surfac , there wa room under each droplet for water vapor to accumul . It wa difficult for thi vapor to escap , so pressur under the drop increas as the vapor built up , until it launch the droplet into the air .And then , to add to the surpris , the droplet bounc higher after it fell to the surfac , and higher again after the next fall . Each time the drop fell , it compress vapor under it , and the compress vapor act like a spring , or a trampolin . When the droplet fell from a greater height , it compress the vapor more .Eventu , the droplet would drift off to the side of the chamber , as their ascent were not complet vertic . If that had not happen , they probabl would have continu until evapor caus them to shrink away .The scientist record anoth type of levit as well .

Cleaner-burn L.N.G. , which consist almost entir of methan , can reduc carbon dioxid emiss by roughli 15 percent to 20 percent compar with the heavi tarlik fuel use on most ship .We came to a decis that rather than put Band-Aid on thing , we should look for way to address core issu of maritim emiss ,  said Peter Keller , the execut vice presid of Tote , the ship compani that built the two vessel at a cost of about $ 350 million .The two ship will make onli a tini dent in the amount of CO2 releas by ship worldwid , about a billion ton a year . And as nation gather in Pari for final negoti on a new climat treati , the issu of greenhous ga emiss from ship remain a point of disput .Environmentalist and other say that too littl ha been done to rein in ship emiss . As a percentag of worldwid carbon dioxid emiss , the contribut from ship is rel small  about 2.6 percent of the global total in 2012 , the most recent year for which firm data avail . But that figur is pois to grow enorm .A report releas last month by the European Parliament conclud that as the global economi expand , and as countri and other industri reduc their carbon footprint , by 2050 , ship could account for about one-sixth of all the CO2 releas into the atmospher by human activ .It will consum a larg part of the carbon budget ,  said Sotiri Rapti , an analyst with Transport and Environ , a feder of European environment group . That will put us at seriou risk of miss emiss targets that would help limit global warm , he said .Becaus most of it work occur at sea , ship is someth of a hidden industri . And out of sight can be out of mind for emiss .It doesnt feel that the industri is under ani scrutini ,  said Tristan Smith , a lectur and research at Univers Colleg London who help prepar a 2014 report on ship emiss . It so invis to the gener public.As evid of thi lack of scrutini , environmentalist say , languag about emiss from ship , and from commerci aviat , wa elimin from a draft of the Pari climat treati dure earlier negoti . Although the languag wa eventu reinstat , there is no certainti it will make the final cut .And while the previou climat treati , the 1997 Kyoto Protocol , did mention ship , unfortun , noth meaning happen ,  Mr. Rapti said .The ship industri and the Intern Maritim Organ , the Unit Nation agenc that is respons for regul it , disagre .Pound for pound and mile for mile , ship is alreadi the most environment effici way to move cargo , and standard to improv effici in new ship went into effect earlier thi year . Those standard are subject to regular review and could be tighten if the technolog support that ,  a spokeswoman for the Unit Nation agenc said .Improv a ship effici mean it burn less fuel . And for most ship , fuel repres at least half the oper cost . So there is an enorm econom incent for ship compani to tri to minim their oper cost ,  said Christoph L. Koch , who recent retir as the presid of the World Ship Council , which repres so-cal liner ship compani that own and oper contain ship and other vessel . And the more you save on fuel , the less CO2 your producing.Mani liner shipper have adopt effici improv , which can includ rel straightforward step like polish the propel or coat the hull with paint that inhibit the growth of alga and other organ , to more extens and expens work to improv engin perform , reshap the bow or add fin or duct to the propel .Some improv are even more elabor . Silverstream Technolog , a London-bas compani , is one of sever that have develop system that produc a carpet of tini air bubbl along the bottom of a ship . The hull touch mostli air , so there much less friction ,  said Noah Silberschmidt , the company chief execut .Silverstream technolog , which includ pump and other equip and modif to the hull , ha been test by Shell ; in sea trial on a 575-foot-long tanker , it improv effici by about 5 percent . A Norwegian Cruis Line ship under construct in Germani will have the technolog when it is launch in 2017 .But the simplest way to improv a ship effici is by slow down . Studi have shown that such slow steaming  reduc speed by at least sever nautic mile per hour  can significantli reduc fuel consumpt , and thu CO2 emiss . In some case , emiss have been reduc by more than half .Slow steam wa wide adopt by liner shipper dure the global econom slowdown that began in 2008 , and industri group point to it as be larg respons for reduc the amount of CO2 emit per unit of cargo .But critic point out that there is no guarante slow steam will continu . In a stronger worldwid economi , there will be greater pressur on shipper to get more good to market sooner . Even if slow steam continu and per-unit emiss remain low , as more cargo is ship , total emiss will increas .Liner shipper move onli about 60 percent of ocean-go cargo . With other type of ship  includ bulk carrier of oil , grain and other commod  the shipown pass the fuel cost on to the compani that is charter the vessel , so there is littl incent for the owner to make improv .The Unit Nation agency effici standard appli onli to new ship , not the approxim 70,000 exist commerci vessel . And becaus of the uniqu structur of the ship industri  vessel are usual regist in countri like Panama and Liberia , partli to avoid stricter regul elsewher  it can be difficult to get inform about environment perform for the industri as a whole and for individu ship .The Carbon War Room , establish by Richard Branson and other to promot market-bas effort to reduc emiss , is tri to plug that hole , evalu and rate ship for their effici , or lack of it , so compani that want to be more environment respons can charter cleaner vessel .There a lack of inform and transpar in be abl to tell a more effici ship from one that is less effici ,  said Victoria Stulgi , a senior associ with the Branson project , ShippingEfficiency.org . By enabl charter to hire cleaner ship , the project aim to acceler retrofit of older one , some of which could still be pli the ocean a quarter-centuri from now .But environmentalist say that effici standard , even if more broadli appli , can go onli so far . The onli way to truli rein in ship emiss , they argu , is by adopt specif reduct target , as mani countri and other industri have .Even if the Intern Maritim Organ tighten it effici standard , thi wont be enough to reduc emiss ,  said Mr. Rapti of Transport and Environ . We need reduct targets.But the ship industri is concern that target could eventu disrupt world trade by restrict ship , and the Unit Nation agenc ha for now reject that approach  most recent in May , when it put off discuss of a propos that would onli have set up a process to work toward reduct target .The propos came from the Marshal Island , which as the third-largest regist of ship after Panama and Liberia , benefit greatli from the ship industri but also stand to suffer from rise sea level in the Pacif caus by climat chang .Depend on the scope of ani reduct target , expert say , the entir industri might eventu have to cut emiss sharpli . Mr. Smith of Univers Colleg London said ship could realist be expect to cut fuel use and emiss by about 50 percent through variou effici improv , includ slow steam . But to continu to improv beyond that is a real challeng ,  he said .What may be need are develop of altern fuel like hydrogen , and use of wind or other renew energi . One of the more promis technolog involv a devic call a Flettner rotor , which wa invent nearli a centuri ago . So far , onli a few ship have these rotor , which are tall column that rotat in a windstream and produc a propuls forc in the same way that a spin basebal follow a curv path .For now , effort like Tote are among the first step toward propel ship with fuel that produc less carbon dioxid .Much of the impetu for build the two ship , howev , grew out of concern about other pollut , includ sulfur dioxid , which caus acid rain , as well as nitrogen oxid and particul matter , or soot , which can caus health problem . Burn liquefi natur ga ha a far greater effect on reduc those emiss than it doe on reduc carbon dioxid .Those pollut are now regul for ship within coastal zone of North America and Europ , and may eventu be more tightli control . Ship compani may shift to lower-sulfur fuel oil or instal scrubber to remov the pollut from exhaust . Some , like Tote , may opt for L.N.G .From a carbon emiss standpoint , liquefi natur ga is not an ideal solut . It is still a fossil fuel , although a cleaner one . And in larg marin engin like the barn-siz one that sit below deck in the Perla del Carib , L.N.G . can not ignit on it own . So with each stroke the engin must burn a small amount of diesel oil , refer to as a pilot fuel , reduc the environment benefit .There are also concern about methan slip ,  or emiss of unburn fuel from the engin . Methan is a far more potent greenhous ga than CO2 , and some studi have suggest that methan slip may at least partial undermin ani gain from use L.N.G .There are also extra cost . The tank , with a thick layer of insul between doubl wall of thick steel , are far more expens than fuel oil tank , and the equip to handl and vapor the supercold liquid is elabor and costli as well .

But not so if you fall victim to cardiac arrest .Sinc the 1960 , cardiopulmonari resuscit  chest compress , ventil , defibril and epinephrin  ha been the go-to approach to reanim a stop heart . But in recent year , expert in critic care have develop an arsen of modern treatment refin .These improv remain underus in practic , howev . As a result , surviv rate after cardiac arrest vari drastic across the countri .In the Unit State , there are roughli 350,000 resuscit attempt outsid hospit each year , with averag surviv rate of 5 to 10 percent , and 750,000 attempt in hospit , with about a 20 percent surviv rate .But except exist in certain area . In Seattl and King Counti , surviv rate for cardiac arrest treat by emerg medic servic provid improv by 22 percent over the last seven year to 19.9 percent , accord to Dr. Graham Nichol , professor of medicin at the Univers of Washington . In place like Detroit , the surviv rate is about 3 percent .These statist show a lot more variat in surviv than we see for stroke and heart attack ,  Dr. Nichol said . Cardiac arrest is inde a treatabl condit . Provid care , and provid better care , is important.Seattl and King County improv come from train E.M. . provid better , continu measur the care they provid , and spread awar that cardiac arrest is a treatabl condit , so citizen are quick to perform bystand CPR , Dr. Nichol said .If Seattle innov could be implement nationwid for out-of-hospit cardiac arrest , he ad , as mani as 30,000 live annual could be save .The problem with cardiac arrest treatment begin with the administr of CPR . It requir endur and train to perform 100 to 120 chest compress a minut , each at a depth of about five centimet . Resuscit often interrupt compress for too long in order to check for a patient puls , starv intern organ of oxygen , studi have found .You should onli be feel for a puls for 10 second , while peopl fumbl around tri to feel a puls for one minut or more ,  said Dr. Stephan Mayer , the director of neurocrit care at the Mount Sinai Health System .Doctor and nurs also tend to give up too soon . CPR is typic perform for 15 to 20 minut , but research show that longer attempt at CPR , up to one hour , can lead to surviv . These patient ultim may fare as well those who are resuscit more quickli . In patient with a chanc of recoveri , expert now advis attempt CPR for at least 45 minut .If no puls return after 20 minut , howev , expert say more power intervent should be consid . Often they are not .Do CPR is like today drive a Model T Ford that itself isnt even be oper properli much of the time ,  said Dr. Sam Parnia , the director of resuscit research at Stoni Brook Hospit . When it struggl to go uphil , we should switch to a more modern car  say a Ferrari with a power engine.One altern to CPR is extra corpor membran oxygen ( ECMO ) , a procedur in which blood is drawn from a patient in cardiac arrest through a cathet place in a central vein , circul through an oxygen filter , and then return to the bodi carri oxygen .ECMO is more wide use in countri like Japan and South Korea than in the Unit State . They routin bring peopl back to life who would remain dead here ,  Dr. Parnia said .Onc circul is restor , a chain of intervent must occur to prevent further injuri to the bodi and brain . But there no guarante that patient will receiv these treatment , which includ avoid toxic amount of oxygen , maintain normal carbon dioxid level and high blood pressur , and sometim a cardiac catheter procedur .It a lotteri of what you will get in the hospit ,  Dr. Parnia said . It may depend on which doctor happen to receiv you , sinc none of these treatment are regulated.Among the most crucial procedur is therapeut hypothermia . Patient who remain comatos after be in cardiac arrest should be cool for at least 24 hour to a temperatur from 89.6 to 96.8 degre Fahrenheit , to slow down the metabol process that caus cell to die .But thi treatment is far more common in Europ than in the Unit State , said Dr. Romergryko Geocadin , professor of neurolog at John Hopkin Univers School of Medicin . And even when hypothermia is use in conjunct with other life-support measur , physician and rel sometim decid to give up on the patient in the first three day , befor the prognosi is truli clear .A lot of progress ha been made in the ICU , with hypothermia , more ventil , more way of support blood pressur and glucos ,  Dr. Geocadin said . So we should give these peopl more time to survive.A major caus of the variat in outcom , expert say , is the lack of systemat benchmark of cardiac arrest data , which would allow hospit to see where they rank against other and motiv better perform .Right now , even at Mount Sinai , where I am the chairman of the CPR committe , we know what our success rate are for resuscit but we have no idea if it is abov averag , averag or below averag ,  Dr. Mayer said . Everyone perform is look at in isolation.Thi lack of account and transpar prompt the Institut of Medicin to call in June for the creation of a nation registri to track the incid and outcom of cardiac arrest .Everi five year , the American Heart Associ releas resuscit guidelin in the journal Circul base on a synthesi of the latest research . The newest updat , publish onlin Oct. 15 , stress the import of bystand immedi give CPR , and doctor in hospit form integr system in the chain of surviv .If I drop the ball sever hour later after someon ha done outstand CPR , that can be just as devast as if no one ha done CPR ,  said Dr. Clifton Callaway , the chairman of the association emerg cardiovascular care committe and professor of emerg medicin at the Univers of Pittsburgh .While the association goal by 2020 is to doubl surviv rate to 16 percent nationwid after out-of-hospit cardiac arrest , the effect of the guidelin remain to be seen .Mi fear is that they wont make much of a differ ,  Dr. Parnia said .

Now , at least one eel enigma is final a step closer to be solv .For the first time , scientist have track American eel migrat to their legendari spawn ground in the Atlant Ocean .For a veri long time , circumstanti evid ha point to the Sargasso Sea as the breed ground of eel , but like crime novel detect , scientist have want conclus proof ,  said David Cairn , a research scientist at Canada Depart of Fisheri and Ocean , who wa not involv in the work .The search for that proof , he ad , ha preoccupi eel scientist for more than a century.American eel spend their adult live , which rang from three to 20 year , in river and estuari from Greenland to Venezuela , but those far-flung popul share a singl reproduct site in the Sargasso Sea . Their migrat to the sea is perhap one of the most impress anim journey in the world , but no one ha ever caught an adult in the open ocean  much less observ them reproduc .Yet without fail , billion of eel larva appear in the Sargasso Sea each spring . It is as though babi sea turtl were emerg on beach where adult have never been spot .Until recent , track devic were simpli too larg to attach to American eel , which weigh a maximum of nine pound . Now , aquat satellit tag have final reach a point of miniatur appropri for these slight anim . The tags onboard sensor continu collect and store inform about temperatur , depth and light , and transmit those data when the tag detach and float to the surfac .GP doe not work under water , so scientist must reconstruct the path taken by a tag eel by feed the collect data into oceanograph comput model .Julian Dodson , a biologist at Laval Univers in Quebec , and hi colleagu have been tri to map the eels progress for some time . In 2011 , they outfit eight eel with tracker and releas them into the Gulf of St. Lawrenc , but almost all were promptli eaten by porbeagl shark .The next year , they tri use eel trap along the Eastern Seaboard . But those eel are smaller and did not fare well with the tag . Final , the team land on a solut .They would transport larg eel trap in the St. Lawrenc estuari into the safer water off Nova Scotia eastern coast , nearer the spawn ground . We gave them a shortcut of about 1,000 kilomet ,  Dr. Dodson said .From 2012 to 2014 , the research releas 38 satellite-tag eel along the coast of Nova Scotia . They manag to gather data from 28 , but one in particular stole the show . As describ recent in Natur Commun , the eel held onto it tracker for 1,500 mile as it journey east from Nova Scotia toward the continent shelf off Newfoundland . There it hung a sharp right , cross the Gulf Stream and made a beelin for the Sargasso Sea .About 150 mile from the edg of the species suppos breed ground , it lost the tracker or wa nab by a predat . As the tracker bob to the surfac , the research receiv it data . All told , they found , Super Eel requir just 45 day to complet it marathon run .Iv been studi fish migrat for over 40 year , and I dont think Iv ever seen a track like that ,  Dr. Dodson said . It wa veri rapid and incred straight  quit spectacular.The research do not know how American eel manag to find their way back to the place of their birth , but they suspect that the anim guid themselv by the earth geomagnet field . Other studi have suggest that eel possess magnet compass that allow them to orient themselv .For now , the find are a tantal start toward solv such mysteri , but they also have conserv implic . American eel are list as endang by the Intern Union for Conserv of Natur , and their number are in declin throughout much of their rang .Hydroelectr dam block the eels migrat inland , and the larva are often illeg fish . A pound of live larva fetch up to $ 2,000 from Chines buyer , who rais the young until adulthood and then sell them to Japan , where eel is consid an expens delicaci , second onli to bluefin tuna .Thi speci is in troubl ,  said Karin Limburg , a fisheri scientist at the State Univers of New York in Syracus , who wa not involv in the studi . In order to develop conserv plan , we need to learn as much as possibl about the entir life cycl of eel , and the largest inform vacuum is thi long , long migrat back to the spawn area.Climat chang also threaten to take a toll on American eel , although it potenti effect are still a matter of specul .If we knew more about the rout adult take to the spawn area , we would be in a better posit to evalu how migrat might chang under variou climat scenario ,  said Jame McCleav , a marin ichthyologist at the Univers of Main , who wa not involv in the studi .Dr. Dodson and hi colleagu aim to answer some of these question in the near futur . They releas an addit 14 satellite-tag eel in Octob ; as of thi month , just three tag eel remain . With luck , we will track them to the spawn ground ,  Dr. Dodson said .Regardless of the outcom , he and other expert are hope to be abl to continu such studi for year to come .We shouldnt just drop thi and say O.K. , that fine ,  said John Casselman , a biologist at Queen Univers in Ontario , who wa not involv in the work .

That ha led to the instal of sensor in home to monitor as mani as 100,000 peopl .The Intel China project use so-cal machine-learn techniqu , chart pattern of behavior for caregiv .Your daili pattern are a vital sign ,  Mr. Dishman said .In addit to smart-hom sensor and mobil robot , there are a varieti of other effort to add stationari robot to provid everyth from coach to commun to companionship .Catalia Health , a San Francisco-bas design compani , ha introduc the Mabu person health care companion , an interact robot about the size of a coffeepot . The system , which ha a cartoonish form , listen and speak and hold a touch-tablet interfac . It is design to act both as a health care coach and to provid a way to stay in touch with doctor offic and pharmaci .Mi approach is , Here are the challeng we see in health care . What is the right technolog ?  said Cori Kidd , chief execut of the start-up firm . Robot happen to be great for help with behavior.A more profound question is whether robot or virtual assist , in tandem with Internet commun , can help forestal the effect of age , like dementia . Isol is one of the most vex problem for older adult , and there is evid that human contact can postpon intellectu declin .A studi publish last summer in the journal Alzheimer & Dementia found that a group of both healthi and mildli cognit impair peopl in their 70 and 80 who engag in face-to-fac daili onlin convers for six week show signific improv in cognit skill compar with a control group .It is not possibl to simpli tell peopl to go out and get more friend , so the idea here wa to provid a meaning and frequent dose of social engag ,  said Dr. Kay , the Oregon Health & Scienc neurologist , who help organ the studi .Internet , tablet and smartphon system such as grandPad , a simplifi tablet for older adult , and CareAngel , a telephon system to help younger famili member stay connect , are emerg to help with care and stave off isol .The ultim test for all these idea will be whether peopl will want to use them .At the Age 2.0 Confer last month in San Francisco , which focus on new elder-car technolog , Cynthia Breazeal , an M.I.T . Media Lab roboticist , show off Jibo , an Internet-connect tabletop robot with a round swivel screen that portray a friendli robot face .The concept did not thrill everyon in the larg lunchtim audienc .Dure a question-and-answ session at the end of the present , a 91-year-old woman said , If Jibo were my last friend , I would be veri depressed.', 'In 2013 , an obes man went to Hvidovr Hospit in Denmark to have hi stomach stapl . All in all , it wa ordinari bariatr surgeri  with one big except .A week befor the oper , the man provid a sperm sampl to Danish scientist . A week after the procedur , he did so again . A year later , he donat a third sampl .Scientist were investig a tantal but controversi hypothesi : that a man experi can alter hi sperm , and that those chang in turn may alter hi children .That idea run counter to standard think about hered : that parent pass down onli gene to their children . Peopl inherit gene that predispos them to obes , or stress , or cancer  or they dont . Whether one parent actual were obes or continu anxiou doesnt rewrit those gene .Yet a number of anim experi in recent year have challeng convent think on hered , suggest that someth more is at work .In 2010 , for exampl , Dr. Romain Barr of the Univers of Copenhagen and hi colleagu fed male rat a high-fat diet and then mate them with femal . Compar with male rat fed a regular diet , those on the high-fat diet father offspr that tend to gain more weight , develop more fat and have more troubl regul insulin level .Eat high-fat food is just one of sever experi a father can have that can chang hi offspr . Stress is anoth . Male rat expos to stress experi  like smell the odor of a fox  will father pup that have a dampen respons to stress .To find the link between a father experi and hi offspring biolog , scientist have taken a close look at sperm . A sperm cell deliv DNA to an egg , of cours . But those gene are regul by swarm of molecul , so-cal epigenet factor .These molecul can respond to environment influenc by silenc some gene and activ other as need . Some studi suggest the chang in epigenet factor can be hand down to offspr via sperm .When Dr. Traci L. Bale , a neuroscientist at the Univers of Pennsylvania , and her colleagu look at the sperm of stress male rat , for exampl , they found unusu level of epigenet molecul call microRNA .They creat a cocktail of microRNA and inject them into embryo from mellow father . As Dr. Bale and her colleagu report recent , the embryo develop into rat with alter stress respons .The notion that environment respons might influenc human health in similar way ha huge implic . But scientist have onli start to investig the epigenet of fatherhood . As is often the case when scientist turn from anim experi to human , the result have been provoc but hardli clear-cut .In 2013 , Adelheid Soubri , a molecular epidemiologist at KU Leuven Univers in Belgium , and her colleagu studi 79 newborn children . They found epigenet differ between children with obes father and those with lean one .Are chang like these actual caus by men obes ? Dr. Barr and hi colleagu set out to investig that potenti link in two way .First , they collect sperm from 10 obes Danish men and 13 lean one . They found numer epigenet differ . One type of epigenet factor they look at involv molecular cap that are place on DNA in a process call methyl . Dr. Barr and hi colleagu found more than 9,000 gene in which the methyl pattern differ between lean and obes men .Then the scientist recruit six obes men get bariatr surgeri to see how lose weight chang these methyl pattern . In a report publish on Thursday in the journal Cell Metabol , Dr. Barr and hi colleagu identifi more than 3,900 gene that were methyl differ a year after surgeri .Among the gene that are epigenet alter are those that affect such behavior as appetit control . But the new studi doe not show whether those chang have ani effect on a father children , Dr. Barr said .I dont want to specul whether it posit or neg in the follow gener ,  he said .Dr. Barr and hi colleagu are now expand on the studi by compar epigenet pattern in the sperm of obes father with the pattern in the blood cell of their offspr . Wer go to tri to see if there someth transmit all the way down ,  Dr. Barr said .Other scientist had mix view about the studi . On one hand , they agre that the research use sophist method to survey epigenet differ in the sperm . But they were wari of draw broad conclus .Dr. John M. Grealli , an epigenet expert at the Albert Einstein Colleg of Medicin , said it wa possibl that genet differ between the men were mostli to blame for the differ seen in their sperm .He also share a concern with Dr. Bale and Dr. Soubri that the studi involv too few men . The differ in such a small sampl might have occur randomli .Honestli , I think a lot of what they have is nois ,  Dr. Grealli said .That doesnt mean that Dr. Grealli think the Danish scientist are wrong , but rather that pin down the epigenet effect that father pass to their children will take much more work .Id say , let do a studi of hundr of peopl ,  Dr. Grealli said . It doabl . It just requir that wer bold about do these things.', 'A rocket pack with 7,700 pound of cargo destin for the Intern Space Station remain on the ground Friday after bad weather again halt the countdown .The mission had been postpon a day earlier becaus of raini weather at the launch site , Cape Canaver Air Forc Station in Florida .

But a new physic process appli to carbon ha uncov a substanc that a group of scientist say is even harder .Research at North Carolina State Univers say they have develop a techniqu for creat a substanc they are call Q-carbon , which repres a third phase , or distinct form , of carbon alongsid graphit and diamond .The discoveri could have mani applic , notabl in the field of medicin and industri . But Jay Narayan , the lead scientist on the studi , ha made one claim about the techniqu that is certain to turn head .In 15 minut , we can make a carat of diamond ,  Mr. Narayan said . A carat is 200 milligram .The process of creat Q-carbon  which involv concentr a veri short puls of laser light onto carbon  can produc minuscul synthet diamond seed ,  which can yield gem .While the amount of diamond is tini compar with the yield of tradit industri techniqu , the process can be carri out at room temperatur and air pressur , the research say , mean it could be easier to reproduc on a larg scale than other method , includ one that ha been draw interest in Silicon Valley known as chemic vapor deposit .But Mr. Narayan and hi colleagu say the potenti for creat synthet gemston pale next to possibl applic of Q-carbon , which the research said is magnet , fluoresc and electroconduct .The techniqu use to creat Q-carbon , which wa pioneer over the summer , wa describ on Monday in the Journal of Appli Physic . A tini laser beam is train onto a piec of amorph carbon for 200 nanosecond , heat it extrem fast . The spot then cool in a process known as quench , creat Q-carbon .It isnt known whether the substanc exist in the natur world , but Mr. Narayan suggest it could be present in the core of planet .Wuyi Wang , the director of research and develop at the Gemolog Institut of America and an expert on diamond geochemistri , said that while he would like to confirm the find himself , if they are true , it will be veri excit news for the diamond research community.He ad that the journal is quit credible and he pretti much trust what they say.Andr Ander , the editor in chief of the journal , echo Mr. Wang excit , as well as hi note of caution .Thi is one of those wow paper ,  he said . I put a sticki note on the manuscript that said pay attent to thi one befor the peer review even happen . But the second thought I have , and thi is the scientist in me , is that Im alway skeptical.Mr. Narayan describ possibl use for Q-carbon in creat synthet bodi part , improv tool like deep-wat drill , and produc brighter , longer last screen for televis and cellphon .Casey Boutwel , who work on commerci licens for scientif discoveri at the university offic of technolog transfer , said he wa brace for strong interest in the techniqu . We dont know exactli how thi can be best appli , and wer excit to get the market input ,  he said .Neil Krishnan , the director of technolog platform at the Swedish industri toolmak Sandvik Hyperion , call Mr. Narayan discoveri extrem interesting.I still think it at a nascent stage for us to consid it a competit threat per se ,  he said . But it would definit be a new technolog that wed be interest in.', 'By snap their jaw onto the ground , trap-jaw ant can flip backward and escap threat . Now research report that these ant can also jump forward .A forward leap is probabl an even more effect way to dodg threat , said Magdalena Sorger , an evolutionari biologist at North Carolina State Univers and the study author . She report her find in the journal Frontier in Ecolog and the Environ .Although jump is common in anim like kangaroo , frog , grasshopp and human , it is rare seen in ant . Onli three of 326 ant genera are known to jump . When ant jump backward , they have littl control and often land on their back , Dr. Sorger said . The forward jump , howev , allow the ant to aim for a land site .The speci that Dr. Sorger studi , Odontomachu rixosu , belong to the subfamili Ponerina and is found in Southeast Asia . Other jump ant have been found in South America , Australia , New Zealand and New Caledonia .It isnt clear exactli how trap-jaw ant manag to jump forward , though Dr. Sorger ha done some preliminari test .I do know that they dont use their front leg at all ,  she said .

By the dozen , they are sign a voluntari agreement commit their jurisdict to faster and deeper reduct in emiss of greenhous gase than their nation govern have promis .We are not move fast enough ,  Gov . Jerri Brown of California , who is help to lead the effort , said in an interview . Wev got to do more.All of which rais a provoc question : What would a truli ambiti plan to tackl climat chang look like ?Despit the intens of the debat around global warm , the question ha long been consid theoret , and few peopl have spent much time studi potenti step to deep decarbonization  certainli not at the level of detail need for a concret plan .Late , that ha start to chang . But the recent analys make clear just how difficult a worldwid transit to a clean energi system is like to be .The arithmet is realli brutal ,  said Jeffrey D. Sach , a promin Columbia Univers economist . Wer in such a dread situat that everi countri ha to make thi transform , or els thi isnt go to work.Dr. Sach help start what is perhap the most seriou effort to draw up a detail road map for the energi transit : the Deep Decarbon Pathway Project , base in Pari and New York . Over the past coupl of year , the effort enlist team from 16 countri , which account for the larg major of global emiss , to devis such plan .The analyst use conserv assumpt about current technolog and their cost . They also presum that develop countri would not be will to make big chang in their way of life  that peopl would continu to insist on transport , refriger , electr light and so forth  and that poor countri would keep strive to reach higher standard of live , requir more energi .The expert also made a point of rule out energi miracl , such as technolog like nuclear fusion that could help enorm if they becam avail but are still larg on the draw board . If we couldnt put on a hard hat and go visit a technolog in the field , at least in pilot stage , then we didnt includ it in our analysi ,  said Ben Haley , a senior consult at Energi and Environment Econom , a consult firm involv in the work .With those assumpt , the expert focus on a specif question : Can emiss be cut enough from now to 2050 to meet an intern target design to head off the worst effect of climat chang ?It can still be done  bare ,  said Guido Schmidt-Traub , the execut director of the Sustain Develop Solut Network , which help organ the effort .Perhap the singl most crucial find of the project is that the technolog avail today , while good enough to get a run start on the transit , are probabl not good enough to finish it .That mean expert who have long argu for a more intens research program on clean energi have a point . The 16-countri analysi suggest that mani technolog , like electr car and offshor wind turbin , have to becom cheaper and better .Bill Gate , the Microsoft founder and philanthropist , ha long argu for a more intens focu in energi innov , and on Monday he announc in Pari that he had corral a group of billionair to invest huge sum in develop new technolog . Twenti countri , includ the Unit State , also pledg to doubl their own invest in basic energi research .In an interview , Mr. Gate said that poor countri would be reluct to switch to clean energi technolog unless it becom better and cheaper , and the onli answer to that is innovation.Yet the new research on decarbon also suggest that the environmentalist who have long call for a rapid expans of exist clean-energi technolog also have a point : The veri process of roll them out help to spur innov , and as they spread beyond nich market , economi of scale drive down the cost .Solar power offer a stun exampl , with cost of the panel plung 80 percent in the last decad , a direct result of subsidi and other polici meant to creat a larger market . In mani place , solar power is still more expens than power produc from fossil fuel , but the differ ha narrow consider .Wind turbin have been a big winner , too , in recent year . They suppli almost 5 percent of the electr power in the Unit State , and in a hand of American state and some smaller countri , that figur ha move into doubl digit . Wind power is so abund in Texa that one compani there is give away electr at night .The good news about wind and solar power ha inspir claim that they could carri the entir load of the energi transit . Mark Z. Jacobson , an engin at Stanford Univers , ha drawn attent with a find that the entir world could oper on 100 percent renew power by 2050 .Yet such scenario would involv an extraordinari push . Dr. Jacobson plan would requir , among mani other action , that 156,000 wind turbin be built off American coast in the next 35 year , and twice as mani on land . In 20 year of effort , European countri have manag to build about 3,000 offshor turbin .In an interview , Dr. Jacobson cite a scientif paper that calcul the oil and ga industri ha been build 50,000 new well a year in North America sinc 2000 . Each of those , he said , is as complic as erect a wind turbin , and build ten of thousand of turbin a year would be well within the nation industri capabl .We think it technic and econom feasibl ,  Dr. Jacobson said . It ultim doe come down to polit will . If peopl dont want to do it , it not go to happen by itself.Dr. Jacobson ha often cite the Unit States mobil dure World War II as an exampl of what can be done by a determin societi . But to some other expert , that veri argument speak to the polit and econom impract of hi plan .I just dont see a World War II-styl mobil happen for anyth other than a world war ,  said Jess Jenkin , an energi analyst at the Massachusett Institut of Technolog . Wer not go to do that . So the question is , what are we go to do ? The scenario laid out by the Deep Decarbon Pathway Project echo Dr. Jacobson plan to a degre , in that they call for substanti amount of renew power . But these scenario also suggest that the energi transit would be easier and cheaper with addit technolog option , includ some that are dislik by the environment movement .For instanc , in some countri with grow power demand , like China , the research found that nuclear power would be essenti for stay within a strict emiss budget . Mr. Jenkin said that new nuclear plant would also be need in some American state that had few other option .And mani expert believ the Unit State , even if it doe not build mani new nuclear plant , would be foolish to shut down the one it ha , given that they suppli 19 percent of the country electr power with minim emiss . Yet some of them have shut down late , occasion becaus of safeti fear but mainli becaus of low power price prompt by the abund of natur ga .The research also suggest that to meet strict target , some countri might need to keep burn coal or natur ga to gener power while captur the carbon dioxid emerg from smokestack , compress it and inject it deep underground .Govern have discuss the need for thi technolog , known as carbon captur and storag , for decad . But they have put littl effort into develop it , and it ha not advanc much beyond the demonstr scale , though a few project are start to come onlin . Environment group have been wari of the technolog , and Germani , among the most determin countri in battl global warm , ha larg decid not to pursu it .Most fossil-fuel compani do not appear to be put much effort into the approach , either , even though it may be the onli way for some of them to stay in busi over the long haul .It is a highli contest technolog , but if they want to save their industri , they should be invest like crazi in prove the technolog ,  Dr. Sach said .Perhap the most compel find of the Deep Decarbon Pathway Project is that govern could easili flub the energi transit by fail to plan far enough ahead . Most countri are set 10- and 15-year target that can be met with increment chang .Yet that almost guarante that the toughest problem , like perfect the carbon-captur technolog , will be tackl too late to meet the long-term goal of zero emiss , the research found .Bi the time you get to the hard thing , youv lost too much time ,  Mr. Schmidt-Traub said . Instead , govern have to figur out where they want to be in 2050 , he said , and then work backward to plot the necessari technolog path , while remain open to new invent .While the best technolog mix vari by state or countri  wind is a good option in Iowa , solar power in Arizona or Australia  the research found some theme across all the countri they examin .To achiev the emiss goal , the entir economi , includ transport , need to be electrifi as much as possibl . That might mean cars run on batteri , but it could also mean cars run on hydrogen , creat by use nighttim electr from nuclear reactor or wind turbin to split water molecul .Either way , the implic is that the internal-combust engin that ha power car sinc the 19th centuri is a technolog dead end in the 21st . So countri like the Unit State that are spend a lot of effort tri to make gasolin car more effici may be go down a blind alley .The scenario for the Unit State , accord to the Deep Decarbon project , do not envis broad adopt of electr car until the 2030 . But that is onli 14 year away , suggest an urgent need to make the car better and cheaper , and to roll out charg station by the million .Anoth potenti dead end , the research suggest , would be an overreli on natur ga . Ga is a lower-carbon fuel than coal , and switch power plant to run on ga can achiev big emiss reduct in the short run . The Obama administr , with it Clean Power Plan , is tri to lock in such a switch in the Unit State .But the deep-decarbon research suggest that ga ha to go away within a few decad , which mean that heavi invest in natur ga pipelin and power plant now could wind up undermin the long-term goal .If it is mayor and citi councilor and governor who are most determin to move forward  as the pledg they are sign befor and dure the Pari confer make clear  what effect can they have on their own , without much support at the nation level ?Some answer are fairli obviou , expert said . In some countri , includ the Unit State , state and local govern control the build code , mani of which still do not includ tough requir for reduc energi demand in new build . Citi like Austin , Tex. , have shown how to set strict code and enforc them .In addit , govern buy million of car , gener for their employe to take short hop around town . Switch those fleet to electr car would help expand the market and reduc cost through economi of scale .Larger govern , like state and provinc , could do more . California , for instanc , ha set a goal of push 1.5 million electr car onto it road over the next eight year , probabl by offer subsidi .A bill that the California Legislatur consid earlier thi year would have order a 50 percent reduct in gasolin use in that state over the next 15 year , by mean unspecifi in the bill ; the oil compani narrowli beat that back , but the fight is probabl not over .The California governor , Mr. Brown , is expect to be one of the star of the gather in Pari , perceiv by mani peopl abroad to be the strongest leader in the Unit State on climat chang . He help to creat the pledg that other mayor and governor are sign .He argu that if state and citi can figur out how to move first on climat , they can essenti drag their nation govern behind them .California , do more than ani other state in America , is set a pace , and will step it up ,  Mr. Brown said . But we have to be part of a larger movement to realli get global warm under control.', 'Lui Ho , 48 , is the director of the Kavli Institut for Astronomi and Astrophys and a professor at Peke Univers in Beij . As an American research who ha work for more than two year in China , he ha a uniqu perspect on the country scientif ambit .Dr. Ho is on leav from Carnegi Observatori in Pasadena , Calif. We spoke for nearli three hour thi summer at hi offic there  it onc belong to Edwin P. Hubbl  and later by telephon . A condens and edit version of the convers follow .Q . Where did you grow up ?A . In Mozambiqu , which dure that time wa still a coloni of Portug . In the Africa of my childhood , there wa a clash of background . The Portugues were not veri accept . There were mani outward express of racism . Then , in the late 1970 , after the countri becam independ and essenti deterior into a veri ugli civil war , we were forc to leav . They confisc all my father properti . We left with our suitcas .Where did you go ?By a stroke of good fortun , we somehow got visa for the U.S. , so to East Boston . I wa 12 , the onli Asian in a veri rough school . My father wash dish . At school , peopl made fun of me . That made me determin to learn English quickli enough to get into a better school , which I did . I got into the best one in the citi , the Boston Latin School . From there I went to Harvard , where it seem as if I wa the onli person who wasnt rich and work . It felt like wherev I went I wa the outsid .When did that end for you ?One day at Harvard , I stumbl into a lectur about the black hole in the Milki Way . I wa absolut captiv . I sought out the lectur , Paul Ho [ no relat ] , and he immedi gave me a research project .One of the thing I love about astronomi wa that it wa not tie to the mundan . It wa not even tie to our planet . Mayb thi wa a reaction against all the day-to-day thing my famili had to struggl with .What area of astronomi did you work in ?Black hole . I wa one of the first peopl to show how common they are . Thi wa one of the result of my doctor thesi in 1995 . Befor , the think wa that they should exist but that they were realli veri rare . I wa abl to demonstr that everi big galaxi ha a nucleu contain supermass black hole . Thi wa suspect befor , but I wa abl to prove it .How did you accomplish that ?By search for an indirect way to show their exist . I look for sign of energi , and what I found wa that basic everi galaxi had a black hole . We just hadnt seen it befor .After I finish my doctor , the Hubbl Space Telescop wa repair . It made it possibl to measur the rotat speed of the star and ga around those black hole . The Hubbl confirm mani of the point of my thesi .How central are black hole to understand what the univers look like ?Wer learn they are to be consid to be one of the key ingredi that make galaxi look the way they do . The big question is , how can someth so tini like a black hole influenc the entir galaxi itself ? The belief now is that they know how to talk to one anoth .We are live in an era of tremend breakthrough in our knowledg of the univers . Whi are we learn so much now ?A lot of it is technology-driven . Astronom have a lot of veri nice new toy . The rapid develop of astronomi is complet tie to access to big telescop . That one reason whi I urg China leader to partner on one of the big new intern telescop .China ha great scientif ambit . It an unwritten rule that to be part of the astronomi club , you need to be part of a big telescop . It wasnt an easi sell . The three new telescop that were come were all to be on foreign soil , and that wa a difficult concept . They eventu choos to join with Caltech , the Univers of California , Canada , Japan and India on the Thirti Meter Telescop .When you were grow up , did you ever think youd come to live and work in China ?Not ever . One of the thing that influenc me wa meet so mani talent young Chines scientist . I help some get into American univers . I could relat to their struggl here . When they return to China , it wasnt alway possibl for them to succeed . There wa a mismatch between their talent and opportun .Over the past decad , thing have begun to chang . China ha made larg scienc invest , and these peopl now have someth to go back to . In 2013 , when the Kavli peopl approach me , I felt I might have someth to contribut to an environ like that .What appeal to you about the foundation offer ?It actual wa veri unapp . It came at the worst possibl moment . My wife and I had just had a babi . There were older kid in high school . They could not be uproot . The job meant live in Beij , with it pollut , traffic and cramp apart . My wife , who stay behind , said , Well just have to make it happen. My wife didnt want me to lose thi opportun .It involv a lot of juggl . To save commut time , I sleep at my Peke Univers offic . I get up at 5 a.m. to Skype my daughter . I tutor my son via the Internet .I return to California everi two month to see them .Chines educ ha a reput for be mechanist and rigid . Have you found it that way ?They had a veri rigid system becaus , in a differ time , that what work .I know what made Carnegi an effect center for astronomi research . It wa an environ that allow a lot of free discuss and brainstorm . Im tri to bring some of that to our institut in China .My dream is that 20 year from now , the best student from Harvard and Princeton will want to go to Peke Univers , not the revers . What my institut can do is provid an oasi where I can expedit the process , becaus I have more control over thi littl patch .I think the Chines system can evolv , and Kavli is provid one model . We have nonhierarch interact discuss . Wev attract veri high-level visitor to lectur and teach . Alreadi , our Kavli Institut attract mani non-Chines postdoc , and they want to come here becaus they see the ferment .The other thing is that China now ha the mean to invest in scienc . And it is will to do so ! Even in the most advanc countri , basic astronomi is a hobbi scienc . Yet in China they are will to spend on it . With that and these great human resourc , the trick is to combin them .After a lifetim of travel and displac , do you feel at home in Beij ?That where I hope I can find a home . That whi I work so hard to make the program success . I am there for the long haul . Iv been learn to speak and write the languag . Funni thing : The last time I return I actual miss the place . A year ago , it wa the most alien place to me .', 'Sea level are rise , and rise faster everi year .Accord to the latest report of the Intergovernment Panel on Climat Chang , sea level rose an averag of 1.7 millimet a year dure the 20th centuri . Some area have had larger rise than other , and measur vari from year to year at differ locat .Measur sea level is difficult . Scientist use tidal gaug and satellit altimet data to measur these chang , and there are some question about the precis of these tool . Variat in land level complic matter further ; it is often difficult to distinguish rise sea from fall land . And as water warm , it expand .Still , there is no question about the basic fact . Sinc 1993 , the averag rate of increas ha nearli doubl , to 3.2 millimet a year . The retreat of glacier and the melt of the Greenland ice sheet have contribut to these acceler increas . Extrem sea level dure storm surg like that of Hurrican Sandi in 2012 have increas sinc 1970 , mainli the result of rise sea .By 2081 , yearli increas are like to be as high as 16 millimet a year , or about six-tenth of an inch . By the end of thi centuri , sea will have risen by as much as three feet , and level will almost certainli continu to rise for mani centuri .The Nation Ocean and Atmospher Administr ha a web tool that show the effect of chang sea level across the countri . A three-foot rise in sea level in Malibu , Calif. , for exampl , would put mani hous near Malibu Beach under water . In New York , most of Harlem River Drive and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive south of 168th Street would be inund , and Elli Island would be about half it present size .

Stick your arm in a cuff for a few second , and there they are : two simpl number , all the inform you need to know whether you are in a healthi rang or high enough that you should be take one of the mani cheap gener drug that can bring down your blood pressur .But the realiti is more confus , as I discov recent when I test mine .It turn out that blood pressur can jump around a lot  as much as 40 point in one day in my case  which rais the question of which read to trust .Ever sinc I wrote about a woman who wa in denial about her high blood pressur until she had a stroke , I have been worri that my blood pressur might creep up without my know it . I becam interest again when I report that a larg feder studi of peopl at high risk for a heart attack or stroke found that bring blood pressur well below the current nation guidelin  a systol blood pressur below 120 millimet of mercuri instead of 140 , or instead of 150 for peopl older than 60  significantli reduc the death rate and the rate of heart attack , stroke and heart failur . The result were so compel that guidelin committe are expect to revis their recommend .A week after that studi wa publish , I decid to check my blood pressur with a home monitor befor a come physic examin . The first night , I wa startl to find that my systol pressur wa a scari 137 . The next night , it wa onli 117 . The next morn , befor I saw my doctor , it wa a terrifi 152 . At the doctor offic , it wa 150 . I measur it again that night , and it had plummet to 110 . And my diastol pressur , the lower number , wa a rock-bottom 60 that even .It seem unreal . Did I have hypertens becaus my pressur had hit 152 in the morn ? But if I took a drug to bring it down , what would happen if my pressur wa tri to go down to 110 in the even ?I ask a few expert .Short answer is , you are normal ,  said Dr. David McCarron , a research associ at the Univers of California , Davi , ad that anyon whose pressur goe down to 120 or , in my case 110/60 , doe not have hypertens . Hi advic to patient is to abstain from obsess monitor their blood pressur .If you are healthi and have no relat health condit , you will lose more qualiti month or year of life by check your B.P . frequent than if you did not ,  he wrote by email .Blood pressur measur is complic , said Dr. Suzann Oparil , the director of prevent cardiolog at the Univers of Alabama at Birmingham and an investig in the clinic trial , call Sprint , that found that a pressur below 120 wa prefer for high-risk patient .There is a lot of controversi over when and how to measur it ,  Dr. Oparil said . If it remain veri high over time with multipl measur , there is no mistak the diagnosi of hypertens . And if it is normal veri low , daili fluctuat will not gener push it into a danger zone . The problem come when blood pressur is in between .The guidelin in the U.S. are base on clinic blood pressur taken in a way that few provid do ,  Dr. Oparil said . The patient should rest for five minut in a chair , not on an exam tabl , and should not talk . The feet should be on the floor , the back straight and support . The patient should not have had caffein and should not have smoke in the past half-hour to an hour . If thi procedur is not follow , she said , the read is gener fals elev and doe not reflect the true blood pressur .Onc Dr. Oparil make a diagnosi of hypertens , she encourag her patient to learn to measur their own blood pressur correctli and keep a record of what it is outsid an offic set . When she see her patient , she consid their pressur number at home and in the clinic in order to adjust their medic .There is anoth option : a devic that automat measur blood pressur everi 15 to 30 minut dure the day and everi 30 to 60 minut at night . You wear the devic for 24 hour . In Britain , Dr. Oparil said , thi sort of ambulatori monitor is requir befor a doctor can diagnos high blood pressur . But patient in the Unit State often refus , say they cant sleep with the cuff inflat through the night .And yet the Unit State Prevent Servic Task Forc , a feder sponsor but independ group that draw up medic guidelin , conclud in a report last Februari that 24-hour ambulatori blood pressur monitor wa the prefer way to confirm whether a person ha high blood pressur .Thi struck a lot of us as surpris ,  said Dr. David Maron , the director of prevent cardiolog at Stanford Univers School of Medicin . In addit to the inconveni , the test cost a coupl of hundr dollar , although it is gener reimburs through insur .Blood pressur measur in a doctor offic can be wrong about half the time , the task forc report . The group , though , found a lot of variabl from studi to studi . In 24 studi in which patient had an offic blood pressur measur and an ambulatori one , the proport who had high blood pressur with both test rang from 35 percent to 95 percent in the differ studi .The task forc conclud that peopl whose pressur wa in the high normal rang in offic visit risk receiv mislead diagnos and be treat unnecessarili . Although the group did not have data on how mani peopl with normal blood pressur were treat for hypertens , it conclud that a substanti number of people could fall into that categori .My doctor suggest the 24-hour test , but I am uncertain at thi point if I want it . If Dr. McCarron is correct that I do not have hypertens , what is the point ? Or should I do as Dr. Oparil suggest and measur my pressur twice a day for sever day and send the read to my doctor ?

Govern subsidi can lead to price break of $ 10,000 or more . The car acceler quickli , too .The dealer play an obvious crucial role in the popular of electr vehicl . Almost all new car are sold through dealership . To a larg extent , dealer decid which car they want to stock , and a salesperson can have a big effect on how someon feel about a prospect purchas .Some electr car buyer have said they felt as if they were the one do the sell . For exampl , Chelsea Dell wa in the market for an electr car in Salt Lake Citi last year , and discov onlin that a local Chevrolet dealer had a use Volt .She made an appoint to test-driv the car .

( Tesla stand apart in the convers about dealer becaus it doe not use them , sell directli to consum . )At the event , Kyle Gray , a BMW salesman , said he wa person enthusiast about the technolog , but list sever reason that dealer may not do more to push the car : Salespeopl who have spent year understand combust car dont have time to learn about a technolog that repres a fraction of overal sale , and the sale process take more time becaus the technolog is new , cut into commiss .Mr. Gray told the stori of a coupl who came into the dealership to tri an electr BMW and , dure a test drive , discov that the brake system felt so differ that the wife wa in the front get sick.In the end , though , he said the coupl got use to the car and love it .

He estim that , over all , 10 percent of dealer are realli sharp on the technolog .Marc Deutsch , Nissan busi develop manag for electr vehicl , said some salespeopl just could not ration the time it take to sell the car . A salesperson can sell two ga burner in less than it take to sell a Leaf ,  he said . It a lot of work for a littl pay.He also point to the potenti loss of servic revenu . There noth much to go wrong ,  Mr. Deutsch said of electr car . There no transmiss to go bad. ( As the Nissan websit state : Say goodby to pricey oil chang and tuneup . With fewer move part than ani car youv ever own , the Nissan Leaf is ultra low maintenance. )Jare Allen , a spokesman for the Nation Automobil Dealer Associ , said there wa not suffici data to prove that electr car would requir less mainten . But he acknowledg that servic wa crucial to dealer profit .Accord to the organ , dealer on averag make three time as much profit from servic as they do from new car sale . A 2013 J.D . Power survey of car buyer found that about 48 percent of electr car buyer plan to take their car back to the dealer for servic , compar with 57 percent for tradit car , note Dr. Cahil , from U.C .

Space-tim could curv , fold , wrap itself up around a dead star and disappear into a black hole . It could jiggl like Santa Claus belli , radiat wave of gravit compress , or whirl like dough in a Mixmast . It could even rip or tear . It could stretch and grow , or it could collaps into a speck of infinit densiti at the end or begin of time .Scientist have been light birthday candl for gener rel all year , includ here at the Institut for Advanc Studi , where Einstein spent the last 22 year of hi life , and where they gather in Novemb to review a centuri of graviti and to attend perform by Brian Green , the Columbia Univers physicist and World Scienc Festiv impresario , and the violinist Joshua Bell . Even natur , it seem , ha been do it bit . Last spring , astronom said they had discov an Einstein cross ,  in which the graviti of a distant cluster of galaxi had split the light from a supernova beyond them into separ beam in which telescop could watch the star explod again and again , in a cosmic version of the movi Groundhog Day.Hardli anybodi would be more surpris by all thi than Einstein himself . The space-tim he conjur turn out to be far more friski than he had bargain for back in 1907 .It wa then  perhap tilt too far back in hi chair at the patent offic in Bern , Switzerland  that he had the revel that a fall bodi would feel weightless . That insight led him to tri to extend hi new rel theori from slip-sid train to the univers .Accord to that foundat theori , now known as special rel , the law of physic dont care how fast you are go  the law of physic and the speed of light are the same . Einstein figur that the law of physic should look the same no matter how you were move  fall , spin , tumbl or be press into the seat of an acceler car .One consequ , Einstein quickli realiz , wa that even light beam would bend downward and time would slow in a gravit field . Graviti wa not a forc transmit across space-tim like magnet ; it wa the geometri of that space-tim itself that kept the planet in their orbit and appl fall .It would take him anoth eight difficult year to figur out just how thi elast space-tim would work , dure which he went from Bern to Pragu to Zurich and then to a prestigi post in Berlin .In 1913 , he and hi old classmat Marcel Grossmann publish with great fanfar an outlin of a graviti theori that wa less rel than they had hope . But it did predict light bend , and Erwin Freundlich , an astronom at the Berlin Observatori , set off to measur the deflect of starlight dure a solar eclips in the Crimea .When World War I start , Freundlich and other on hi expedit were arrest as spi . Then Einstein discov a flaw in hi calcul .There are two way that a theoretician goe astray ,  he wrote to the physicist Hendrik Lorentz . 1 ) The devil lead him around by the nose with a fals hypothesi ( for thi he deserv piti ) 2 ) Hi argument are erron and ridicul ( for thi he deserv a beat ) .And so the stage wa set for a seri of lectur to the Prussian Academi that would constitut the final countdown on hi quest to grasp graviti .Midway through the month , he use the emerg theori to calcul a puzzl anomali in the motion of Mercuri ; it egg-shap orbit chang by 43 second of arc per centuri . The answer wa spot on , and Einstein had heart palpit .The equat that Einstein wrote out a week later wa ident to one that he had written in hi notebook two year befor but had abandon .On one side of the equal sign wa the distribut of matter and energi in space . On the other side wa the geometri of the space , the so-cal metric , which wa a prescript for how to comput the distanc between two point .As the Princeton physicist John Wheeler later describ it , Space-tim tell matter how to move ; matter tell space-tim how to curve. Easi to say , but hard to comput . The star might be actor on a stage set , but everi time they move , the whole stage rearrang itself .It wasnt long befor Einstein receiv hi first comeupp .In Decemb 1915 , he receiv a telegram from Karl Schwarzschild , a German astrophysicist serv at the front in the war , who had solv Einstein equat to describ the gravit field around a solitari star .One strang featur of hi work wa that at a certain distanc from the star  to be known forev as the Schwarzschild radiu  the equat would go kerblooey .If thi result were real , it would be a true disast ,  Einstein said . Thi wa the begin of black hole .That Einstein equat could be solv at all for a singl star baffl him . One of hi guid light had been the Austrian physicist and philosoph Ernst Mach , who taught that everyth in the univers wa rel . Einstein took Mach Principl , as he call it , to mean that it should be imposs to solv hi equat for the case of a solitari object .One can express it as a joke ,  he told Schwarzschild . If all thing were to disappear from the world , then accord to Newton Galilean inerti space remain . Accord to my concept , howev , noth is left.And yet here wa a star , accord to hi equat , bend space all by itself , a littl univers in a nutshel .Like most of hi colleagu at the time , Einstein consid the univers to consist of a cloud of star , the Milki Way , surround by vast space . What wa beyond ? Wa the univers infinit ? And if so , what stop a star from drift so far that it would have noth to relat to ?To avoid such problem , Einstein set out in 1917 to design a univers without boundari . In hi model , space is bent around to meet itself , like the side of a tin can .I have commit anoth suggest with respect to gravit which expos me to the danger of be confin to the nut hous ,  he confid to a friend .Thi got rid of the need for troublesom boundari . But thi univers wa unstabl , and the cylind would collaps if someth didnt hold it side apart .That someth wa a fudg factor ad to the equat Einstein call the cosmolog constant . Physic , thi new term , denot by the Greek letter lambda , repres a long-rang repuls forc .The happi result , Einstein thought , wa a static univers of the type nearli everybodi believ they live in and in which geometri wa strictli determin by matter .But it didnt last . Willem de Sitter , a Dutch astronom , came up with hi own solut describ a univers that had no matter at all and wa fli apart .It would be unsatisfactori , in my opinion ,  Einstein grumbl , if a world without matter were possible.And then Edwin Hubbl discov that the univers realli wa expand .If the cosmolog constant couldnt keep the univers still , then forget about it and Mach Principl , Einstein said . It date back to the time in which one thought that the ponder bodies are the onli physic real entiti ,  he later wrote to the British cosmologist Felix Pirani .But it wa too late . Quantum mechan soon invest empti space with energi . In 1998 astronom discov that dark energi , act just like the cosmolog constant , seem to be blow space-tim apart , just as in de Sitter univers .In fact , most cosmologist agre today that not quit all motion is rel and that space-tim doe have an exist independ of matter , though it is anyth but static and absolut . The best exampl are gravit wave , rippl of compress and stretch speed through empti space at the speed of light .Einstein wa back and forth on thi . In 1916 , he told Schwarzschild they did not exist , then publish a paper say they did . In 1936 , he and hi assist did the same flip-flop again .Nobodi said thi wa easi , even for Einstein .He set out to do one thing , name make all motion rel , Michel Janssen , a scienc historian at the Univers of Minnesota , told a Princeton gather thi month . He fail , but in the process succeed in do someth veri interest , unifi the effect of acceler and graviti .The stori goe to show , he said , that Bob Dylan wa right when he sang there no success like failur ,  but wrong that failur is no success at all.Einstein greatest success came in 1919 , when Arthur Eddington did the experi that Freundlich had set out to do , and ascertain that light in the heaven were all askew dure an eclips , bent by the sun dark graviti , just as Einstein had predict .Ask what he would have done if gener rel had fail , Einstein said , Then I would have been sorri for the dear Lord . The theori is correct.And still the champ .', 'With the public of hi gener theori of rel a centuri ago , Albert Einstein swept asid tradit notion of a static and unchang space and instead gave us the stretchi , suppl miracl fabric of the space-tim continuum .No longer could space be seen as a featureless void , the nothing between the something of galaxi and star . Einsteinian space ha heft , shape and a sens of place . It bend around giant sun and plung down the throat of black hole . It expand restlessli in all direct and drag us along for the ride .Space refus to be ignor , clamor for attent even in human pursuit . In art , architectur , music , the design of our citi and the psycholog of the invis , multistag privaci zone we construct around our bodi , space can speak volum , and it demand to be explor .Think your comfort with a colleagu at work ? Anat Perri , a postdoctor fellow in psycholog at the Univers of California , Berkeley , suggest you tri thi simpl exercis . The next time you speak to the person , adjust the space between yourselv by the length of a pinki , stand two inch closer or farther away than you normal would .It chang everyth ,  Dr. Perri said . You cant interact the same way.The sculptor Rachel Whiteread express the pushi of space graphic by creat what are often call neg space . She use resin , plaster or other materi to fill in the area under a tabl , behind a bookshelf , or an entir room .The result three-dimension impress are like space trap in amber , or the frozen ghost of a room , prompt the viewer to appreci the specif power of interstiti space and to recal what it felt like to hide under tabl as a child or to seek solac in the compartment wilder of a colleg library stack .Music is the space between note ,  the French compos Claud Debussi is believ to have said  that is , onli by the grace of precis articul paus can the charact of individu note be perceiv and music distinguish from nois .In a slightli differ take on the theme , jazz musician often insist that the note they choos not to play are as import as the one they do . Music is tightli bound up with expect , they say : You hear a sequenc of note in a familiar scale , and you anticip the rest of the progress .But then , ha-ha ! The musician doesnt give it to you , and that absenc of comfort resolut is what transform bromid into art .In a collabor art form like jazz , the pianist Geri Allen said , a willing to listen close to the other musician on the stage is essenti to success , and sometim not play can be a greater contribut to the flow than grab everi chanc for a solo .Among painter , advanc in spatial represent have often usher in broad aesthet revolut . The formul of the law of perspect in the 14th centuri gave artist permiss to see everyth in a new way ,  the artist Matthew Ritchi said . Now your sky isnt flat . Youv got a proper sky with depth , and now your angel can get up to some real mischief.In the mid-19th centuri , painter discov anew the two-dimension natur of the canva , spark the rise of abstract art .The flat surfac wa seen as a place for the arrang of color ,  said Noam M. Elcott , an associ professor of art at Columbia Univers . For artist like Czann , he said , the space between figur wa grant equal weight to the so-cal foreground.The concern with spatial democraci reach it apotheosi in the work of Jackson Pollock , in which there is no foreground , no background , and everi squar inch of canva is equal to everi other ,  said Dr. Elcott , the author of the come book , Artifici Dark : An Obscur Histori of Modern Art and Media.Other modernist painter like Picasso , Marcel Duchamp and Kazimir Malevich becam fascin with the idea of a higher fourth dimens  not the dimens of time that , through Einstein gener theori of rel , wa merg with three spatial dimens into space-tim , but a fourth dimens of space , said Linda D. Henderson , a professor of art histori at the Univers of Texa at Austin and the author of The Fourth Dimens and Non-Euclidean Geometri in Modern Art.The theme aros from popular interest at the end of the 19th centuri with advanc in geometri , the discoveri of X-ray , and the 1884 public of Edwin Abbott Abbott influenti book Flatland : A Romanc of Mani Dimens ,  an allegori of life in two dimens .It becom a huge cultur preoccup ,  Dr. Henderson said , the idea that the human retina is see just a fraction of the electromagnet spectrum , and that our world might be like Flatland or Plato cave , a shadow of a complex four-dimension reality.Henc a Cubist work like Picasso 1910 Portrait of a Woman ,  with it shift , multifoc form dissolv into one anoth . Picasso is do everyth possibl to keep the imag from be read as three-dimension ,  Dr. Henderson said .Today , Mr. Ritchi and other artist seek to visual even more exot concept like hyperspac or quantum space , and here , too , the quest can prove liber .If wer onli see 5 percent of the univers , you can state freeli what the other 95 percent might be , and nobodi can say that it isnt ,  said Mr. Ritchi , who ha collabor with the physicist Lisa Randal of Harvard and Neil Turok of the Perimet Institut , and whose work wa includ in a major exhibit , The Shape of Space ,  sever year ago at the Guggenheim Museum .Mr. Ritchi stack layer of semitranspar draw that he later reshap into sculptur and larg instal  of line snake and wrap togeth , for exampl , over the floor , up the wall , through the air , like the trace we leav behind us , all the mistak , all the good moment , that anticip and follow us as we move through space and time ,  he said .More pragmat , our movement through space and time concern architect and urban planner , who tri to determin the often unspoken desir and assumpt we bring to a given space .For exampl , said Tim Stock , a commerci anthropologist and a partner in the design research firm scenarioDNA , we want a hotel room to convey the sens both that we are at home and that we are the first person to use the room  an illus foster by small touch like the art fold down of the bedspread to expos the sheet , as though to say , fresh and new and all for you .The uncertainti of the labor market are reflect in shift trend in offic design . Until recent , one posit in a corpor wa reflect by the size and locat of one offic , a larg corner offic with breathtak view signal high statu .Tech compani have chang all that ,  Mr. Stock said . The peopl in charg dont necessarili have an offic . They just float around , they just show up , theyr everywhere.Yet for peopl who are not in charg , an open offic where employe float from one workstat to the next hold less appeal . There been some pushback against the Silicon Valley model ,  said Alic T. Friedman , a professor of art and architectur at Wellesley Colleg . When possibl , peopl tend to wall off a littl area they can call their own.After all , peopl do exactli that with the air around them , metaphor claim the region surround their bodi as a mostli inviol person space . Research have determin that the size of our prefer spatial bubbl vari somewhat accord to cultur .Isra who travel to India might feel peopl were stand too close ,  said Dr. Perri , of the Univers of California , Berkeley , who is Isra . But when they go to Europ , person space is larger ; peopl may seem too cold.On averag , howev , one person space  as measur by an experiment walk slowli toward a subject until the subject feel on the verg of uncomfort and say stop  extend about two feet in front of the bodi .That distanc happen to correspond to the length of the arm , suggest that person space amount to defens space . Person space ha been found to enlarg in peopl hold stick or pointer , and to contract when they are burden with weight .Our person space is human specif , said Dr. Daphn J. Holt , a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at Massachusett Gener Hospit and Harvard Medic School .She and her colleagu recent found that while the imag of an approach face will arous the part of the brain that monitor person space , the imag of an approach car will not .And when wer forc into uncomfort close quarter with stranger aboard a crowd subway car , we reach for our smartphon and carv out some person space-tim onlin .', 'A bedsid light power by the housepl sit next to it ?

One is a set of gene that spew out antibodi to the malari parasit harbor by the mosquito . Mosquito with these gene are render resist to the parasit and so can not spread malaria .The other modif is a set of genet element known as a gene drive that should propel the malaria-resist gene throughout a natur mosquito popul . When a malaria-resist male mosquito mate with a wild femal , the gene drive copi both itself and the resist gene over from the male chromosom to it femal counterpart .Becaus almost all the progeni carri the new gene , instead of just 50 percent as would be expect by Mendel law of genet , the insert gene are expect to spread rapidli and take over a wild popul in as few as 10 gener , or a singl season . A larg region , at least in principl , could be freed from malaria , which kill almost 600,000 peopl a year .The anti-malari antibodi gene were develop by a group led by Anthoni A. Jame of the Univers of California , Irvin , and the gene drive by Valentino M. Gantz and Ethan Bier of the Univers of California , San Diego . The two team report the result of their collabor in Monday issu of Proceed of the Nation Academi of Scienc .Thi is a veri import advanc in the field of mosquito biolog ,  said Georg Dimopoulo , a biologist at John Hopkin who ha engin mosquito to resist the malari parasit with a differ set of gene .Kevin Esvelt , an expert on the gene drive techniqu at Harvard , said he wa delight with the work of the two team . We have a wonder chanc of knock down malaria and dengu fever and other diseas , so hat off to Toni Jame , who ha been develop these techniqu for 15 year ,  he said .The two team came togeth after Dr. Gantz and Dr. Bier develop a gene drive for the Drosophila fruit fli , a standard laboratori organ , to help identifi genet mutant insect . Find their gene drive wa far more effici than expect , drive it cargo gene into almost all the fruit fli progeni , the research realiz they had creat not just a handi laboratori tool but a power techniqu for spread favor gene through wild popul .After send a report of their find to the journal Scienc , which publish it in April , Dr. Bier start look around for practic use for the techniqu , and came across a 2012 articl in which Dr. Jame describ make mosquito resist to the malari parasit . Dr. Jame conclud hi paper by note that if coupl with a mechan for gene spread ,  hi resist gene could becom a self-sustain diseas control tool. Have develop just such a mechan , Dr. Bier call Dr. Jame to propos a collabor .It took Dr. Gantz about two month to load all the necessari genet element onto a plasmid , a viruslik circl of DNA that genet engin use to insert gene into chromosom . Some 680 wild mosquito larva were inject with the cargo-carri plasmid . About half grew to adult , which were mate with wild mosquito , and the progeni were then screen to see if the inject plasmid had success found their way to the egg or sperm of the origin larva .To help track the progress of the experi , Dr. Gantz engin a color marker into the plasmid cargo , a gene that turn the mosquitoes eye red . Thu the appear of red-ey mosquito would mean the drive and it cargo had success been inherit .Olga Tatarenkova , a member of Dr. James team , pick up the task of screen 25,000 mosquito larva . One Saturday morn in Juli , she found two larva with red eye . After check with other member to verifi her find , she email Dr. Jame to tell him the good news .Dr. Jame , Dr. Gantz and Dr. Bier plan to refin the mosquitoes genet and conduct trial in cage . He hope that eventu scientist in some countri where malaria is endem will invit them to conduct a field trial and will monitor it care to make sure there are no advers affect , even though it hard to see ani ecolog downsid to protect the mosquito against the malari parasit .Dr. Dimopoulo , who ha engin mosquito to rev up their immun system and reject the malaria parasit , plan to add a gene drive as Dr. Jame ha done , and to seek the Zambian government approv for a trial in a larg , greenhouselik enclosur he oper in southern Zambia .Render the wild mosquito popul immun to the malaria parasit may seem a fairli minim and benign intervent . But no gene drive have yet been releas into the wild , and biologist are keen to avoid surpris that might arous public hostil to the novel technolog .A more like mishap is that the gene drive and it cargo gene will start to develop mutat that impair their inherit or that natur select will favor other gene that overwhelm them . The biologist could respond by develop new gene drive and cargo , but the process could becom uneconom , in which case the new approach would fail or offer just partial advantag .Dr. Jame plan to proceed in care stage with the knowledg and approv of local author . Thi is the kind of technolog where the first trial ha to be a success ,  he said .', 'Three year have pass sinc a case of Type 3 wild polio viru ha been detect in the world , which mean that particular viral subtyp ha most like disappear forev , the World Health Organ announc thi month .It demis could speed up the drive to elimin polio , which ha gone on for 27 year and now cost more than $ 1 billion a year .The last known Type 3 polio case wa an 11-month-old boy in northern Nigeria who becam paralyz on Nov. 10 , 2012 .When vaccin were first invent in the 1950 , there were three polio strain , which had nicknam .

But no one realli know .Epidemiolog studi are inher uncertain , a point that Mari Mycio , the author of Wormwood Forest : A Natur Histori of Chernobyl ,  make in the documentari .All of the medic studi are flaw , and flaw in such a way that partisan on both side of the nuclear debat can argu that the studi prove their point ,  she say . You dont come here for clear answers.What she describ is happen now in Fukushima . The scientif consensu is that the radiat will probabl not caus ani excess case of childhood thyroid cancer , as it did in Chernobyl , accord to a report releas in August by the Intern Atom Energi Agenc . The exposur were much lower , and the Japanes govern quickli took measur to discourag the consumpt of milk and other food that concentr radioact iodin .But a paper last month in the journal Epidemiolog claim to have uncov a thyroid cancer epidem that had somehow gone unnot . The result have been seiz on by antinuclear activist and disput by skeptic who find flaw in the methodolog . They make a persuas case that the epidem is an illus .Beneath the layer of spin and interpret , there is presum a fuzzi edg truth . When it come to live on Earth , the babushka of Chernobyl have it figur . Life , they know in their bone , is a matter of balanc risk .', 'The agricultur revolut wa one of the most profound event in human histori , lead to the rise of modern civil . Now , in the first studi of it kind , an intern team of scientist ha found that after agricultur arriv in Europ 8,500 year ago , people DNA underw widespread chang , alter their height , digest , immun system and skin color .Research had found indirect clue of some of these alter by studi the genom of live European . But the new studi , they said , make it possibl to see the chang as they occur over thousand of year .For decad wev been tri to figur out what happen in the past ,  said Rasmu Nielsen , a geneticist at the Univers of California , Berkeley , who wa not involv in the new studi . And now we have a time machine.Befor the advent of studi of ancient DNA , scientist had reli mainli on bone and other physic remain to understand European histori . The earliest bone of modern human in Europ date to about 45,000 year ago , research have found .Earli European live as hunter-gather for over 35,000 year . About 8,500 year ago , farmer left their first mark in the archaeolog record of the contin .By studi live European , scientist had alreadi found evid suggest that their ancestor adapt to agricultur through natur select . As tool to sequenc DNA becam more readili avail , research even discov some of the molecular underpin of these trait .But these studi couldnt help determin exactli when the chang occur , or whether they result from natur select or the migrat of peopl into Europ from other region .Scientist are now tackl these question in a much more direct way , thank to a rapidli grow suppli of DNA from ancient skeleton . These studi have reveal that the DNA of European today come from three main sourc .Befor the rise of agricultur , Europ wa home to a popul of hunter-gather . Then a wave of peopl arriv whose DNA resembl that of peopl in the Near East . It like that they brought agricultur with them .Final , about 4,500 year ago , a nomad popul from the stepp of Russia , known as the Yamnaya , swept into Europ .The analys that reveal these migrat were base on dozen of ancient European genom . But in a studi publish Monday in Natur , David Reich , a geneticist at Harvard Medic School , and hi colleagu analyz the genom of 230 peopl who live between 8,500 and 2,300 year ago .The enorm sampl size ha provid enough data to track individu genet variat as they becom more or less common through the histori of ancient Europ .The remain that Dr. Reich and hi colleagu analyz DNA from span the entir contin of Europ . They also includ the Yamnaya as well as 21 peopl who live in a region of Turkey call Anatolia 8,500 year ago . The studi mark the first time scientist have been abl to analyz the DNA of the peopl who brought farm to Europ .The research compar these ancient gene to those of live human . Their analysi confirm earlier hypothes base on live European , but also reveal that other gene have evolv , too .Previou studi had suggest that European becam better abl to digest milk onc they began rais cattl . Dr. Reich and hi colleagu confirm that LCT , a gene that aid milk digest , did experi intens natur select , rapidli becom more common in ancient European . But it didnt happen when farm began in Europ , as had been suppos . The earliest sign of thi chang , it turn out , date back onli 4,000 year .While agricultur brought benefit like a new suppli of protein in milk , it also creat risk . Earli European farmer who depend mainli on wheat and other crop risk get low dose of import nutrient .So a gene call SLC22A4 prove advantag as soon as European start to farm , Dr. Reich and hi colleagu found . It encod a protein on the surfac of cell that draw in an amino acid call ergothionein . Wheat and other crop have low level of ergothionein , and the new variant increas it absorpt . That would have increas the chanc of surviv among the farmer who had the gene .Yet thi solut creat a problem of it own . The same segment of DNA that carri SLC22A4 also contain a variat that rais the risk of digest disord like irrit bowel syndrom . These diseas , then , may be an indirect consequ of Europe pivot toward agricultur .Dr. Reich and hi colleagu also track chang in the color of European skin .The origin hunter-gather , descend of peopl who had come from Africa , had dark skin as recent as 9,000 year ago . Farmer arriv from Anatolia were lighter , and thi trait spread through Europ . Later , a new gene variant emerg that lighten European skin even more .Whi ? Scientist have long thought that light skin help captur more vitamin D in sunlight at high latitud . But earli hunter-gather manag well with dark skin . Dr. Reich suggest that they got enough vitamin D in the meat they caught .He hypothes that it wa the shift to agricultur , which reduc the intak of vitamin D , that may have trigger a chang in skin color .The new collect of ancient DNA also allow Dr. Reich and hi colleagu to track the puzzl evolut of height in Europ . After sort through 169 height-rel gene , they found that Anatolian farmer were rel tall , and the Yamnaya even taller .Northern European inherit a larger amount of Yamnaya DNA , make them taller , too . But in southern Europ , peopl grew shorter after the advent of farm .Dr. Reich said it wasnt clear whi natur select favor short statur in the south and not in the north . Whatev the reason , thi evolutionari histori still shape differ in height across the contin today .Dr. Reich and other research are gather even more ancient European DNA , which will allow them to uncov more effect of natur select . Inde , other research are do the same on other contin .One day , they may be abl to track histor chang in the human genom across the globe over ten of thousand of year .I think in the futur we can do thi everywher in the world , not just in Europ ,  Dr. Reich said .', 'GREENSBORO , N.C.  When the African penguin Derek and Geirfugl were given their own room last spring , keeper at the Greensboro Scienc Center question whether they like each other enough to take their relationship to the next level .Derek wa more interest in interact with her human keeper than with other penguin . And when she did start to flirt with Geirfugl , lean toward him and flick her head back and forth , the male bird did not return the sentiment .By mid-Septemb , though , the relationship had taken an amor turn . On a recent afternoon , they nestl besid each other insid a plastic crate  on a nest contain two egg .Geirfugl is actual a realli good mate ,  said Shannon Fletcher , a keeper at the scienc center . He done all of the collect for their nest box . He been veri protect of her.In the wild , African penguin , which inhabit the coast of South Africa and Namibia , choos their partner from a pool of thousand and mate for life . In captiv , the limit size of the coloni  and the need to perpetu a genet divers speci  make human intervent necessari .The African penguin popul ha declin more than 60 percent over the past 30 year , and the speci is now consid endang . The Associ of Zoo and Aquarium run a speci survival program among the nearli 50 facil with African penguin coloni , includ the scienc center here .Scientist gather the genet inform on more than 800 bird held around the countri and make breed recommend base on which are least relat to one anoth . The facil maintain studbooks that track the inform and carri out prescrib breed and transfer plan .One of the newer facil to join the program , the Greensboro center start it penguin coloni  now 17 bird  just over two year ago . As it turn out , while the scienc guid the plan is fairli straightforward , penguin group dynam are not .One day thi penguin like thi penguin , and the next day , theyr not talk ,  said Carmen Murray , a former senior keeper . Theyr flirt and tri to get attent , or be a bulli and pick on a certain one.Becaus penguin prefer rare correspond exactli with speci manag plan mandat , the keeper are respons for manag the penguins love live , often by gentli tri to convinc certain bird that they fanci each other , while keep other potenti partner distract .Breed healthi penguin is both a scienc and an art , said Steve Sarro , curat of the Smithsonian Nation Zoolog Park and coordin of the zoo association African penguin program .The scienc is in the medicin and nutrit , and the art is in the keeper staff , the institut , know their anim ,  he said . You need to be abl to finess your coloni so you get the best out of them.Complet in June 2013 , the glass-wal penguin enclosur at the Greensboro scienc center contain a 9,500-gallon pool of water against a backdrop of faux granit rock . The penguin here lead soap-opera live , to hear their keeper tell it .When Geirfugl wa bond with a bird name Kaaps , for exampl , the coupl took nest too far and began hoard rock from the exhibit  more than 100 pound  in their nest box , crush a coupl of egg . After the keeper set them up in a room with a nest box and a few token rock , they turn out to be wonder parent .Thi season , Kaaps and Tux , both femal , bond with each other rather than male , becaus their former mate were both in keeper-design relationship with other femal . ( Littl is known of gender prefer among penguin ; howev , albatross are known to establish same-sex pair bond . )When the femal pair began to compet with Apollo , Tux former mate , and hi new spous for a nest box , the keeper gave the femal one of their own , pray it would prevent Tux from sabotag her ex current relationship .Then there are the star-cross lover Guinn , a male with prize gene , and Jumok , whose genet makeup is less optim . Guinn doesnt much care about that .Even when he and hi assign mate are do well , he keep come back to Jumok ,  Ms. Murray said . Guinn would serv the speci by move on , of cours , but he just cant quit her .Glenn Dobrogosz , execut director of the scienc center , describ manag the bird as a matter of priorit the long-term well-b of the speci over the individu prefer of the penguin .Some peopl would say that not fair or nice , becaus your take a bond that ha previous form and your break it up , but wer not see ani neg repercuss to it whatsoev ,  Mr. Dobrogosz said .Their new bond seem to be happi . Theyr get along , theyr build nest togeth , theyr cooper , theyr switch off lay on the egg . Ultim , 10 , 20 , 30 year down the road , it better for the species.Despit the interperson challeng , the penguin have been veri success breeder . All seven coupl design to mate last year produc healthi chick .In the wild , howev , African penguin face continu threat , mostli from peopl . The collect of guano for fertil ha depriv them of the materi they use to build burrow . Oil spill in 1994 and 2000 kill 30,000 bird despit rehabilit effort . And commerci overfish ha forc the bird to swim much farther for food .One hundr fifti year ago , there were million in the wild ,  said Mr. Sarro , of the Smithsonian . Now wer down to 18,000 breed pairs.Last spring , the zoo associ launch a campaign focus on restor endang animals wild popul to healthi level . Becaus of their vulner , African penguin were among the first four speci chosen .The associ hope captiv coloni will act as ambassador for their wild counterpart , build public support for conserv effort .Back at the scienc center , Derek and Geirfugl warm their egg in the back room as sever other adult pair sat on egg in their nest box . Two chick born last year , Jordi and Keuchli , stood press togeth on a rock overlook the pool of water , groom each other face feather .The yearl are definit practic ,  Ms. Fletcher , the keeper , said . But theyr in that awkward teen phase . Theyr tri to figur it all out.', 'Q . Do squirrel see the color fall display of red , yellow and brown leav ?A. Squirrel do have color vision , but they can not see the differ between the green leav of summer and the red leav of fall , research say .A 1987 studi of the tree squirrel , publish in The Journal of Compar Physiolog A , analyz their color vision use behavior test and examin the kind of color-sens nerv cell in their retina .The research conclud that the familiar gray tree squirrel , Sciuru carolinensi , have dichromat color vision .

But when those patient face decis about what they want to happen , and not happen , as they near death , they need to talk over their option , not receiv an addit M.R.I .So in 2009 , Repres Earl Blumenau , then a seven-term Democrat from Oregon , introduc a provis into what would becom the Afford Care Act requir that Medicar cover voluntari discuss with a physician about advanc direct and end-of-lif treatment prefer .Geriatrician , palli care doctor and hospic staffer all vividli rememb what happen next : It wa the Dec. 7 , 1941 , of advance-car plan .Conserv blast the idea as the embodi of evil , the precursor to government-sponsor euthanasia . Sarah Palin denounc the creation of death panels.None of that wa remot true , but the measur disappear from the health care act nonetheless .Medicar offici later tri to incorpor advance-car consult into a packag of regul , then back off again . It wa the height of the frenzi , and the administr got cold feet and yank it ,  Mr. Blumenau said afterward .Last month , howev , thi six-year struggl came to a quiet resolut . With hardli a rippl of dissent , Medicar author payment for end-of-lif discuss .Now health care profession can punch in a code to bill Medicar for sit down with patient to discuss end-of-lif decis . Theyll get paid $ 86 for the first half-hour convers in an offic ( in a hospit , it $ 80 ) , and $ 75 for an addit 30 minut . If you need to reopen the subject in a few month , or a few year , Medicar will pay again .What chang thi time around ? The apprehens and concern ha slowli eb as public support got stronger ,  Mr. Blumenau said . And some of the peopl make the most outrag charg have gone on to make outrag charg about other things.Public support doe appear strong . The feder Center for Medicar and Medicaid Servic receiv hundr of comment thi fall on it propos rule , a spokesman told me ; the great major felt the agenc should pay doctor to confer with patient about the end of life .Almost univers , peopl say doctor should be talk to their patient about thi ,  said Liz Hamel , who direct public opinion research for the Kaiser Famili Foundat . In a survey of 1,200 adult in Septemb , more than 80 percent said Medicar should cover doctor-pati discuss of end-of-lif treatment . A similar major thought privat insur should , too .The poll also demonstr how rare these convers take place . Fewer than one in five respond report actual have had such a discuss with a health care provid , includ onli about a third of those over age 75 and about a third of those with a debilit disabl or chronic medic condit .Ani emerg room physician or intens care unit social worker can tell harrow tale of frantic tri to locat a rel , a neighbor , a document  ani clue to what an incapacit older adult want when she cant speak for herself .Medicar reimburs , ala , will not magic solv that problem . A lot ha to happen first .Somehow patient must learn that they can have extend discuss about life and death decis with a doctor if they want to . In the Kaiser poll , about a third said they wouldnt want to talk to a doctor about the end of life .( In fact , Kaiser poll from 2010 through 2014 repeatedli found that 30 percent to 40 percent of respond mistakenli believ that the health care law establish a govern panel to make end-of-lif decis for Medicar beneficiari . Death panel live , if onli in the imagin . )Somehow , too , doctor must learn how to broach and explor veri tender subject . The prospect make them hesit and anxiou , said Dr. Dian Meier , who lead the Center to Advanc Palli Care at Mount Sinai Hospit in New York .The great major of provid allow to use these new code have had no train in effect commun about what most import to peopl with a seriou ill ,  Dr. Meier said . Peopl are not born know how to have these convers ani more than theyr born know how to do an appendectomy.Befor health care profession can pose unnerv what-if question , truli listen to people answer , and help frame a plan , commun skill need to be practic and drill and rehears ,  Dr. Meier ad . It cognit and emot difficult.Moreov , even when patient , famili and doctor manag to travers thi tough terrain , sometim peopl do all the right thing , and they still get medic care on autopilot ,  Mr. Blumenau said .He and co-sponsor from both parti plan to introduc legisl next year to train provid in end-of-lif discuss , find effect way to store and access advance-car direct , and measur how well the whole apparatu work . We need to ensur that thi express of interest follow peopl , that it get integr into the record and ultim that it respect ,  he said .A tall order . For everi hospit social worker lament that patient havent discuss how they want to be care for when theyr extrem ill and the medic option are run out , there are patient or famili member argu that they knew and express exactli what they want  and were overridden .Crucial document are left in drawer or safe . Peopl make decis , then chang their mind . Health care proxi , appoint to make decis for peopl who cant speak for themselv , dont alway know that theyv been select to play that role . It a messi busi .Still , thi modest move by Medicar could make a substanti differ . Far more import than the money  physician arent go to boost their incom enorm by bill $ 86 for a half-hour  is the messag . It an import step to have the feder govern place a valu on the convers about end of life ,  Mr. Blumenau said .Wev been urg for year to have thi convers .

When the Yellowston grizzli bear wa list as threaten under the Endang Speci Act in 1975 , there were onli about 100 to 200 of them in the park and the surround countri .The main culprit in their declin wa , oddli , garbag . Bear raid Dumpster in a campground or , say , lap up bacon greas behind an outfitter tent were often shot as scari nuisanc .A 35-year campaign to clean up dump and bear-proof garbag can  and to teach peopl to keep picnic basket and cooler in the car  ha had a signific payoff . There were 717 grizzli at last count in the 20 million acr in and around Yellowston Nation Park .Still , the bear have all but disappear from almost all of the continent Unit State , except for Yellowston and Glacier Nation Park and a few other sliver of habitat . All told , there are about 1,800 in the lower 48 state . One reason for the overal declin is that they have the lowest reproduct rate of ani mammal in North America , besid human .Sow have their first cub at five to eight year of age , and space them three year apart . Just one in three cub surviv to adulthood . A grizzli live about 30 year on averag .Now scientist are at a crossroad : Some biologist say that the grizzlies number are robust and that it is time to remov the most stringent protect for the bear , delisting them under the speci act , which among other consequ mean they would probabl be hunt again for sport . That prospect disturb even those in favor of lift the restrict .Cite the grizzly recoveri in the wild countri in and around Yellowston , the Fish and Wildlif Servic tri to delist the bear in 2007 . Environmentalist su , and a feder court forc offici to redo an analysi of the futur of the whitebark pine tree , whose nut are an import food for the bear .The tree number have declin wide as the climat in the Rocki Mountain ha warm , and tree-kil insect are take a steep toll .Nevertheless , feder biologist say the plan to manag the grizzli after delist is adequ . But lift protect is still a hotli contest proposit .If delist is complet thi time  perhap as soon as the end of the year  park offici will continu to manag the bear within Yellowstone 2.2 million acr , where they will essenti remain protect .But in the rug , wild countri around the park , the Fish and Wildlif Servic would turn over manag of the bear to the state of Montana , Idaho and Wyom . That would probabl mean a return to the hunt of grizzli for sport in those state .Kerri Gunther , a biologist who head the bear manag program at Yellowston , say he favor delist the bear . But although he is a hunter , Dr. Gunther say he can not imagin shoot a grizzli . Each bear is an individu ,  he said . They are highli intelligent.But sympathi for the grizzli is often accompani by fear . The big bear  male rang up to 700 pound and femal up to 400  occasion attack human ; last year , a hiker in Yellowston wa kill by a sow with two cub .With delist , there would be a limit on total grizzli death a year in the Yellowston ecosystem , which would includ everyth from hunt to bear hit by a car or dispatch by biologist . If number drop below 600 in the ecosystem , discretionari mortalities will be halt , includ hunt .Critic say that delist would put the big bear at risk and that it is be done for polit , not scientif , reason . Mani Western vehement oppos the feder author repres by the Endang Speci Act ; some rancher say bear are prey on their herd more frequent , and some hunter are eager for a trophi .But the grizzli popul is lower than feder offici believ and is dwindl , accord to David Mattson , a retir wildlif biologist who ha analyz feder data . The delist propos ha also given short shrift to the effect of warmer and drier weather , he ad . The ecosystem is unraveling becaus of climat chang , he said , and will continu to do so as temperatur grow warmer .The declin of key bear food , like trout , pine nut and elk , mean the popul may continu to drop , Dr. Mattson said .Whi rush with a decis to delist , when all indic are of a popul that is vulner and posit to declin even more than they alreadi have ?  he said .Other research argu that the grizzli are like to prove resili to climat chang . Studi show that the bear are wide-rang omnivor , eat everyth from ladybug and moth to earthworm , plant root , grass and wild berri .If they lose one food sourc , Dr. Gunther said , they will switch to anoth . Bear are better adapt to deal with climat chang than a lot of other speci ,  he said . They onc rang from Alaska to the arid region of Mexico.Scientist like Dr. Gunther also argu that a great deal ha been learn about grizzli , now one of the most studi wildlif popul .Whatev the futur hold , the recoveri of the Yellowston grizzli ha been remark . While clean up garbag ha been central , there were other import element : Domest sheep have been move out of bear habitat , and homeown were urg to keep dog food and bird seed out of the reach of bear .Technolog ha also play a key role . About 10 percent of the region grizzli were fit with GP collar by feder biologist in the 1990 . Whereabout of some bear now is record everi hour and beam to an airplan to be download onto researchers comput .The result is a veri detail pictur of what a bear ha been forag , where it is travel  and the habitat that need to be protect .Sophist hair analysi ha open anoth window into how grizzli live .

Final I peek over , and he look normal.The test use on their embryo is call preimplant genet screen , or P.G.S. , a biopsi perform by pluck a few cell from the develop embryo . Just a few year ago , P.G. . wa precis enough onli to ascertain whether an embryo wa normal or abnorm .Now high-resolut , next-gener sequenc ha sharpen the view , and research are find someth surpris : About 20 percent of embryo have both normal and abnorm cell , and the percentag increas with matern age .

A condens and edit version of the convers follow .Q . Where did you grow up ?A . Here in New York . The Upper East Side . My mother is an urban archaeologist . My father  he die in 1992  wa a jazz musician .There couldnt have been a lot of natur in your childhood .Actual , there wa a lot of natur , urban natur . Central Park isnt natur , but to a child , it appear to be . It ha man-mad pond full of wildlif  sunfish , largemouth bass , frog . There must have been five differ turtl speci in there .Across the park wa the American Museum of Natur Histori . I spent mani hour there entranc by the diorama of Akeley Hall . I wa taken with how at the begin of the last centuri , theyd use paint , light and taxidermi to creat an immers theatric experi set in natur . Afterward , Id go home and paint background on the tropic fish tank my mother let me keep .Did you alway want to be a painter ?I want to be some kind of artist . As a kid , I wa interest in scienc and scienc fiction , histori , draw , sketch . None of thi came togeth in a defin way .In the earli 1980 , I enrol at the Rhode Island School of Design , think I might studi film . After a year and a half , I took a break to figur out anoth path . Eventu , I enrol at the School of Visual Art here in Manhattan , with vagu ambit to learn scientif illustr . There I encount a veri kind teacher who suggest I consid fine art . For her class , she had me copi an 1853 paint by Gustav Courbet . That wa so much fun ! I wa 22 , and I had never made an oil paint befor . I immedi switch major and never look back .Onc I wa onto that path , I got excel advic from someon who knew the art world . He ask , What are you bring that uniqu ? I realiz I had all these childhood interest in natur histori . It struck me that if I took idea from conceptu art and pop art and appli them to my childhood interest , I could creat a hybrid languag . To thi day , that how I frame what I do . Im a pop artist who use natur histori , and it histori , as the basi of my work .Your paint are often root in scientif issu  climat chang , extinct , invas speci . How do you go about research your project ?I start like a journalist . I ask question , and I figur out what is the interest thing go on . Then I find out who know about it , and then I tri to talk to them . Befor I begin , Ill go out to see thing firsthand . I never start off with an idea of what I want it to look like .For instanc , right now , Im work on a seri of draw about the natur histori of life in New York Citi . Thi is for an exhibit that open at Salon 94 on April 18 . The show will be a kind of unoffici censu of the city flora and fauna . For it , I went on a scout trip to Coney Island Creek where there a wreck of a submarin and mani abandon car . At low tide , you could see an amaz , almost postapocalypt scene : dozen of wade bird  egret , heron , ibis  look for food among abandon car and shipwreck .On anoth day , Carl Mehl , a paleontologist at the American Museum of Natur Histori , gave me a tour of local place where fossil have been discov . We went around to clay pit in Staten Island and the Palisad in New Jersey . I even found a marin fossil that I gave to my wife , Dorothi ! That day , I collect 20 bag of soil and organ materi from the differ site wed visit .Whi did you do that ?Ill use it as pigment in draw of creatur who onc live in those place . I first start do that in 1994 , when my friend Mark Dion and I took a trip to Guyana . We were travel in the rain forest . He wa collect specimen , and I wa make these meticul draw of insect . One day while in thi realli isol place , my pencil disappear ! What to do now ? I end up grab a bunch of mud and use it to make art . I came back with a whole bodi of work made of Guyanes mud .Is the natur world a reliabl sourc for art suppli ?Not alway . Onc , I wa make thi seri of piec about the histori of the La Brea Tar Pit in Lo Angel . I ask the director of the museum there to send me a canist of tar . If I could make the tar fluid enough , I thought , I could use it draw the creatur of the Tar Pit .Well , to do that , I had to find the right solvent . As I experi , all I got wa a congeal mess that ate the paper . Through a lot of trial and error , I discov that benzen could thin the tar out to an appropri consist .Do you take note while do your field research ?I do . I make littl thumbnail diagram with arrow and word . Later , in my studio , I look for pictur on how thi subject been shown scientif in the past . Ill also talk to expert in a given scientif area .In 1999 , in start thi 24-foot-long paint for the 2004 reopen of the Brooklyn Museum , I took on the issu of climat chang . The piec , Manifest Destini ,  ha sinc been bought by the Smithsonian Museum of American Art in Washington , where it current hang . The idea wa to ask , What will the Brooklyn waterfront look sever centuri from now , after the glacier have melt ? So I ask myself : Who one of the most interest peopl work on climat chang ? It Jame Hansen . I got an introduct and went up to hi offic near Columbia . I also talk to Cynthia Rosenzweig . She model the effect of climat chang on citi . I construct the paint by project some of what they told me could happen . Brooklyn is in ruin . The relic of human are on the bottom of the East River . The Brooklyn Bridg is rust away . Afterward I thought , Im glad I wont be around.', 'From shark to giraff , mani of Earth biggest and most magnific speci are threaten with extinct . A new studi of the fossil record indic that onc larg vertebr disappear , evolut can not quickli restor them  for ten of million of year , most anim remain small .The studi , publish Thursday in Scienc , emerg from research carri out by Lauren Sallan , a paleontologist at the Univers of Pennsylvania .Studi fish that live dure the Mississippian Period , from 359 million to 323 million year ago , she notic that they were substanti smaller than their ancestor .It piqu my curios ,  Dr. Sallan said in an interview . Whi are these fish so small ?  ( She earn a nicknam from her fellow paleontologist : the Sardin Queen . )Other paleontologist had previous notic that some group of speci seem to shrink in size over time . It call the Lilliput Effect , after the fiction island in Jonathan Swift Gulliver Travels inhabit by tini peopl .Research found that the Lilliput Effect often occur after abrupt and widespread extinct . Dr. Sallan fish appear to fit the pattern : They shrank after a mass extinct at the end of the Devonian Period , 359 million year ago .Scientist suspect that thi mass extinct wa trigger by a global chill that brought glacier all the way to the tropic . The deep freez wa brutal both for fish and for the earli land vertebr ( known as tetrapod ) that were just start to clamber around on feet with toe . An estim 96 percent of all vertebr becam extinct at the begin of the Mississippian Period .Still , scientist have been uncertain about how import the Lilliput Effect wa . The case document by paleontologist had been limit to small group of speci and typic the research onli look at fossil over a limit stretch of time , befor and after mass extinct .Some thought these Great Shrink might be illusori ; small-bodi fossil , they note , might be more like to be preserv than big one . Dr. Sallan decid to put the Lilliput Effect to a stronger test .Work with Andrew K. Gallimberti , then an undergradu at Kalamazoo Colleg , Dr. Sallan studi everi known vertebr speci that live in both the Devonian and Mississippian . With onlin databas and digit fossil scan , Dr. Sallan and Mr. Gallimberti estim the bodi length of 1,120 fossil anim .After the mass extinct 359 million year ago , the scientist found , vertebr were smaller on averag than befor , and they stay that way for the next 36 million year .Peter J. Wagner , a curat of paleobiolog at the Smithsonian Institut who wa not involv in the studi , said one of it strength wa the broad stretch of time it cover .Previou studi were more like snapshot of what thing were like befor and afterward ,  he said . Thi studi goe much further. Dr. Wagner , who wrote a commentari in Scienc accompani the new studi , said the work wa also import becaus it dissect the Lilliput Effect , examin trend in differ group of speci .Some group simpli stay at the same diminish size dure the Mississippian , while other steadili shrank . Shark , for exampl , dwindl from over a yard long to about just a few inch . Our own tetrapod rel shrank from the size of dog to the size of cat or smaller .That not to say that all vertebr got tini  a few actual got bigger . One group of monstrou fish call rhizodontid , for exampl , includ some speci that grew to nearli the size of a killer whale .But these group of big vertebr didnt produc mani new speci . Instead , they dwindl in divers until they becam extinct altogeth . That whi we watch Shark Week instead of Rhizodontid Week.Dr. Sallan said that these pattern could help explain the Lilliput Effect . Small vertebr may have had an evolutionari edg that made them less like to becom extinct at the end of the Devonian . Perhap they grew quickli and reproduc earli in life , make them less vulner to ecolog disrupt .But even after the deep freez wa over , larg speci didnt bounc back for a long time . Dr. Sallan suspect that thi wa becaus the world ecosystem remain decim for million of year , pose an endur challeng to the surviv of vertebr . They had to do more with less ,  said Dr. Sallan .Small vertebr recolon the planet , adapt to the ecolog nich left empti by the mass extinct . Fill those nich took an unimagin long period of time , Dr. Sallan suggest . Onli after easier nich were full did some vertebr start evolv new pattern of growth to adapt to differ nich , reach bigger size in the process .Dr. Sallan see a worri parallel between the extinct of larg vertebr 359 million year ago and their slow disappear today .If they becom extinct in larg number , she said , there no guarante that evolut will bring back big speci in short order .It like that the global ecosystem will snap into thi altern state ,  said Dr. Sallan  one domin by small vertebr . Theyll be happi to stay there for million of years.', 'Research in Egypt use advanc scan techniqu to studi the Pyramid said thi week that they had detect thermal anomalies within the Great Pyramid of Giza that could indic the presenc of an undiscov tomb .That is one possibl explan for strike differ in temperatur that the multin research team said it found between the stone at ground level on the eastern side of the 4,500-year-old structur , accord to Egypt Ministri of Antiqu .The first row of the pyramid stone are all uniform , then we come here and find that there a differ in the format ,  Mamdouh el-Damati , the Egyptian minist of antiqu , said to journalist on Monday , accord to The Associ Press .He said the team found that there is someth like a small passag in the ground that you can see , lead up to the pyramid ground , reach an area with a differ temperatur . What will be behind it ? The team also found thermal anomali on three other pyramid in Giza and Dahshur , 12 mile south , but the ministri said in a statement that the temperatur differ detect at the Great Pyramid were particularli impressive.While the anomali on the other pyramid rang from 0.1 to 0.5 degre , the team found that some stone on the Great Pyramid were six degre warmer or cooler than the stone next to them .There is someth here ,  Hani Helal , a professor at Cairo Univers involv in the project , told CNN . Someth is not normal with respect to the other part of the Pyramid.The Ministri of Antiqu said the temperatur differ could be caus by the presenc of void beneath the surface or the movement of intern air currents beneath the stone block .

As such , it ha been studi for hundr of year .The announc on Monday came just two week into the Scan Pyramids project , a long-term effort be conduct by research from Cairo Univers , the Univers of Laval in Quebec and Nagoya Univers in Japan that is schedul to continu until the end of 2016 .The goal is to use non-invas visual techniques like infrar scanner , laser and drone to get a comprehens pictur of the monuments intern structur without drill the slightest open ,  accord to the project websit .The ministri said that the team next project would be to build a 3-D model of the Giza Plateau in an effort to better understand the construct of the Pyramid .Last week , the team said in a statement that it would use method similar to those employ at the Great Pyramid to studi the wall of the tomb of Tutankhamen in the Valley of the King , outsid the citi of Luxor .

To their surpris , they found branch , leav and trunk teem with life , in some case talli more than 100 speci for a singl redwood .It is , of cours , extrem awesom that redwood themselv are so enorm and old , but the fact that they support entir miniatur commun of so mani other speci is mind-boggl ,  said Rikk Rees Nsborg , a lichenologist associ with the Univers of California , Berkeley . There are mani , mani more speci up there than peopl origin thought.Coast redwood are not the world largest tree  that titl belong to their inland cousin , the giant sequoia  but they are the tallest , reach up to 379 feet high .

But grow that tall also take time  the oldest coast redwood is an estim 2,200 year old .Despit these impress statist , the fact that redwood are home to so mani addit speci intrigu Dr. Nsborg and her husband , Cameron William , a doctor candid at the Univers of California , Berkeley , who met Dr. Nsborg over a decad ago at a lichen confer in Estonia . The research had suspect that the redwoods rosi color namesak tannin would deter commun from form in the tree , becaus mani organ do find those chemic unpalat .Mr. William wa the first to tri to identifi all the player involv in those commun . He focus on epiphyt ( liter on plant ) , or speci that grow on tree without harm them , like moss , lichen and other veget . Ascend redwood in northwestern California , he found trunk wrap in blanket of fuzzi , grass-green moss ; twig cover by whimsic chartreus lichen wisp ; and in place where they could eke out a precari roothold , a varieti of sapl and bush  currant , huckleberri , hemlock and more  some of which had epiphyt commun of their own .

The leagu ask the research to conduct an epiphyt survey of redwood commun at the southern end of the tree rang . Preliminari result of that studi reveal pattern of divers  237 speci so far  similar to those found in the north .In both the north and south , from Jedediah Smith Redwood State Park to Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park , lichen  science-fiction-lik organ that exist as symbiot assembl of fungi and alga or cyanobacteria  make up most of the speci identifi . About 17,000 lichen speci are known worldwid , although much about them remain unknown  for exampl , the potenti use for the more than 600 uniqu compound that lichen are known to produc . Some of them are alreadi be use today as antibiot in soap and deodor , and other as ingredi in tradit treatment for constip , arthriti and kidney diseas ; other still are be investig as cancer-fight agent .Potenti , we could find some compound that could be benefici to human ,  Dr. Nsborg said . We realli dont know what wed be miss if we dont climb the trees.Inde , climb wa crucial for the researchers discoveri : Just 33 percent of the lichen divers they found wa on the ground . But view the vibrant commun firsthand involv more than get there . Almost all old-growth redwood are in park and reserv where climb the tree is prohibit ; even scientist can have troubl obtain the necessari permit .In Mr. Williams case , that involv submit a detail propos to California State Park author , who sent it to other canopi research to assess it valid and also ask about hi abil to climb safe and gentli , as well as undergo long interview both by phone and in the field .Onc a year , over a few weekend in March , an except is made , allow nonscientist to experi what it like at the top of a roughli 800-year-old redwood known as Grandfath , on privat properti near Lo Gato , Calif . The annual event is organ by Tim Kovar , a master instructor who regularli arrang excurs .I love educ peopl , get them interest in scienc and what go on in the treetop  a place right abov our head but usual out of reach ,  Mr. Kovar said . He also assist canopi scientist around the world with data collect and tree-climb techniqu . The knowledg that come from hang with scientist is a gift ,  Mr. Kovar said .On Easter Sunday , Mr. Kovar , Mr. William and Dr. Nsborg outfit four novic climber , includ me , with saddl . Fashion a bit like diaper , they would support us as we made our way up and down the tree use two piec of gear , an ascend and a descend . After a brief demonstr and a practic run , we clip onto rope hang from Grandfather branch , which Mr. Kovar had rig use a crossbow .While there are sever method for ascend , we use the so-cal Texa style , a sit-stand-sit-stand techniqu often employ by research . Slowli , we began inch-worm our way up , pass bird nest and woodpeck hole , splotch of lichen and scar of long-ago lightn strike . Although no data were be collect , Mr. William school us on the histori of redwood . As the ground slowli reced , hi word grew a bit distant as I felt my chest constrict and mouth go dri . Although Mr. Kovar had never had an accid , we were dizzyingli high . The experts cool demeanor kept me ground , howev . As Mr. Kovar said , Enjoy thi tree time.An hour and a half later , we final broke through the shadow into the canopi , stop just shi of Grandfather 200-foot summit . Gaze out at a haze of treetop bath in the late afternoon sun , I wa remind of Bilbo Baggins view of Mirkwood Forest in The Hobbit  a tini figur lost among giant . Still , the forest wa noth like it use to be . Befor the 1700 , redwood cover around two million acr from southwestern Oregon to Big Sur , Calif. Log and develop have reduc the old-growth tree to just 120,000 acr .Mr. William final broke our contempl silenc .I think the best outcom of these guid climb is that most particip are humbl ,  he said . If more peopl were abl to climb among the branch of such an immens live organ , I believ wed have better conserv valu as a whole.', 'Global concentr of carbon dioxid in Earth atmospher surpass 400 part per million for a monthli averag thi past spring , breach a symbol barrier set by climat scientist and polici maker , accord to a report releas Monday .Concentr of other greenhous gase produc from human activ , such as methan and nitrou oxid , also reach record in 2014 , the World Meteorolog Organ announc in it annual Greenhous Ga Bulletin . The report is one of sever measur made by differ climat agenc to address the state of greenhous gase in advanc of the Pari Climat Summit .Thi evid show us that the concentr are increas , and they are increas with increas rate ,  said Oksana Tarasova , chief of the W.M.O. Atmospher Environ Research Divis . Thi call for urgent and veri strong action to limit the emiss of those greenhous gasses.In 2014 , the averag global atmospher carbon dioxid level rose to 397.7 part per million , substanti higher than the 278 part per million float in the atmospher dure preindustri time , or befor 1750 . The research report that the annual averag is expect to pass 400 part per million in 2016 .But Dr. Tarasova note that exceed the 400 mark doe not denot an immedi catastroph .There is noth magic about 400 , it noth better than 399 or 401 ,  she said . Thi is like our oblig to ourselv , wed like to not go over 400 . It symbolic. She said that surpass the threshold onli show that our commit are not there.In 2014 , methan in the air increas by nine part per billion over 2013 , which repres two and a half time it preindustri level . Nitrou oxid reach 1.1 part per billion more than it level in 2013 , an increas of 20 percent from it preindustri level , accord to the find .The report also note interact between greenhous ga emiss and water vapor in the atmospher . Human produc carbon dioxid that heat up Earth surfac , which then heat up the atmospher .Hotter air can hold more moistur , which exacerb greenhous warm . Accord to Dr. Tarasova , if carbon dioxid level reach 560 part per million , or doubl their preindustri level , the feedback loop would caus water vapor and cloud to increas atmospher warm to a rate that is three time as much as what the human-caus gase can do by themselv .We shouldnt blame water vapor for make thi place warmer ,  she said . Rather , she said , by limit the emiss of carbon dioxid , nitrou oxid and methan , peopl can balanc the feedback loop and mitig futur warm .', 'AMESBURi , Inglaterra  Hace uno 6.300 ao , un rbol cay en est lugar .Ubicado junto a un mananti y cerca de tierra apta para la cacera , cre una excelent oportunidad para que se establecieran lo antiguo habitant de esta part del sur de Inglaterra .Segn David Jacqu , arquelogo de la Universidad de Buckingham , llenaron la rac levantada del rbol con lodo para hacer un muro . Y no muy lejo , pusieron un post en un agujero , quiz para sosten un techo de junco o piel de anim .Era una casa , dijo Jacqu , una de la primera construida en Inglaterra .El me pasado , en la excavacin m recient en Blick Mead , Jacqu y su equipo excavaron una zanja de 12 metro de largo , siet de ancho y un metro y medio de profundidad para examinar esta estructura y el rea alrededor de ella . Encontraron una especi de chimenea con fragmento de piedra negra con grieta causada por el fuego , pedazo de hueso , lmina de piedra para punta de flecha y herramienta de cort , adem de vasija ocr que pueden habers utilizado como pigmento .Aqu hay ruido , dijo Jacqu , al imaginar cmo era todo en el ao 4300 a.C. Aqu hay gent haciendo mucha cosa . Igual que nosotro , con lo mismo apuro y preocupaciones .Como a un kilmetro y medio est Stoneheng .Jacqu cree que la casa forma part de la historia de Stoneheng , aunqu lo habitant de la casa de Blick Mead nunca vieron ese conjunto de piedra enorm . Stoneheng comenz a erigirs m de mil ao despu .Pero asegur que Blick Mead ayuda a llenar el espacio de tiempo en que lo cazador y recolector se convirtieron en agricultor para despu construir Stoneheng y otro monumento prehistrico en distinta rea del campo ingl .Se trata del primer captulo desconocido de Stonehenge , afirm Jacqu .Stoneheng ha cautivado a generacin tra generacin . A lo largo de lo ao , lo arquelogo han logrado catalogar roca , deducir el significado de su distribucin ( alineada en la direccin del solsticio del verano y el solsticio de invierno ) y estudiar hueso humano y de animal enterrado en el lugar . Tambin descubrieron otro monumento , como cmara mortuoria , una colina de caliza de uno 40 metro de alto conocida como Silburi Hill y mucha otra estructura circular . Una inspeccin area realizada en 1925 revel crculo de madera , a lo que ahora se designa Woodheng , a uno tre kilmetro de Stoneheng .El monumento monoltico es icnico , seal Wolfgang Neubauer , director del Ludwig Boltzmann Institut for Archaeolog Prospect and Virtual Archaeolog en Viena . Pero es slo una pequea part del conjunto .La historia de Bretaa comienza a final de la ltima era glaciar . En ese clima fro , se qued vaca y sin gent . Con tanta agua del ocano congelada en lo glaciar , el nivel del mar era m bajo y Bretaa segua conectada a Europa . Mientra se calentaba el planeta , lo poblador siguieron caminando de vuelta hacia esa tierra hasta que la agua subieron y cortaron el puent terrestr .Alrededor del ao 3800 a. C. aparecieron lo primero grand monumento , montculo rectangular que servan como cmara mortuoria .Cerca del ao 3500 a. C. , cerca del sitio de Stoneheng excavaron una zanja de aproximadament tre kilmetro de largo y un metro de ancho , conocida como el Cursu de Stoneheng . ( Cursu en latn significa pista de carrera ; el arquelogo que la descubri en el siglo XVIII crey que se trataba de una pista romana ) .La primera etapa del propio Stoneheng , una zanja circular de base , se hizo alrededor del 2900 a. C. , y erigieron anillo de madera .Uno 400 ao despu , fue el apogeo de la estructura circular . ( La caracterstica particular de esta estructura no son la roca o la madera en posicin vertic , sino una zanja circular rodeada por un banco elevado . En est sentido , hoy Stoneheng no cumpl esa caracterstica ; el banco elevado se encuentra dentro de la zanja ) .A uno 30 kilmetro al nort de Stoneheng queda Aveburi , con tre crculo de piedra . El crculo exterior tien m de 300 metro de dimetro , tan grand que el pueblo de Aveburi se extiend dentro de la estructura ; en el centro se encuentra un pub , llamado Red Lion , que se fund hace cuatro siglo .M cerca de Stoneheng est Durrington Wall , una estructura circular de barro de casi 500 metro de dimetro .Michael Parker Pearson , de Univers Colleg London , excav casa en Durrington Wall y a lo largo del ro Avon , y sugier que en est sitio vivieron lo constructor durant la etapa m imponent de creacin de Stoneheng , que comenz alrededor del 2600 a. C. La piedra gigant , con un peso aproximado de 40 tonelada , fueron esculpida y movida de lugar . Cree que la piedra arenisca azul m pequea , de una do tonelada cada una , fueron llevada a Stoneheng durant la construccin inici desd la montaa Prese de Gale y que en est momento movieron m piedra de gran tamao .Como lo primero habitant no tenan lenguaj escrito , sigu sin responders la pregunta m sencilla : Por qu se construy ?Segn la opinin de Parker Pearson , Durrington Wall era la tierra de lo vivo , simbolizado por la madera de Woodheng , mientra que Stoneheng era la tierra de lo muerto . Cree que eso primero habitant se reunan en Durrington Wall para festejar y salir en procesin de ah hacia Stoneheng para honrar a su ancestro .El me pasado en la revista Antiqu , Parker Pearson y su colega describieron uno residuo que identificaron en el interior de una olla de cocina como cido graso .Tenemo el men , dijo : re y cerdo , hervido y a la parrilla , con un poco de manzana , fruto del bosqu y avellana . Bsicament , consuman una dieta de mucha carne .Timothi Darvil , de la Universidad de Bournemouth , quien dirigi una pequea excavacin en Stoneheng en 2008 , tien una idea diferent sobr la importancia del monumento . En cuanto a la piedra arenisca azul , cree que no se aadieron al monumento sino hasta la segunda fase , alrededor del 2500 a. C. , y conform a la leyenda , poseen poder curativo . Esa piedra son muy especiales , subray Darvil . Quiz no se ha comprendido totalment su importancia .Aadi que tal vez Stoneheng originalment era la tierra de lo muertos , como asever Parker Pearson . Pero m adelant , Stoneheng se convirti en una especi de Lourd prehistrico , dond la persona acudan en busca de sanacin . Vemo Stoneheng m como un lugar para lo vivos , concluy Darvil .Pued haber mucho m bajo la superfici .Suponemo que lo pedazo que conocamo eran lo importantes , declar Vincent Gaffney de la Universidad de Bradford . Pero lo que necesitamo es descubrir qu exist en realidad .La idea de usar georradar y magnetmetro para echar un vistazo en el subsuelo sin excavar se origin hace dcada . Pero en ao recient , lo equipo , en particular la computadora para analizar lo dato , han bajado de precio y cuentan con la rapidez necesaria para poder usars de manera generalizada en la arqueologa .Neubauer colabor con Gaffney para examinar casi 13 kilmetro cuadrado alrededor de Stoneheng y Durrington Wall . Parec que un ejrcito se desplaz por la zona , dijo Gaffney .En septiembr anunciaron algo sorprendent : en lo banco de Durrington Wall hay cerca de 90 piedra vertical enterrada , alguna de hasta cuatro metro y medio de alto . Gaffney seal que originalment podran haber sido 200 , m del dobl que en Stoneheng . Eso no da idea de la escala del lugar , enfatiz .De ser verdad , esto afectara la diferenciacin de Parker Pearson entr Durrington Wall como la tierra de lo vivo y Stoneheng como la tierra de lo muerto . Pero l muestra escepticismo ant esto hallazgo , que todava no han sido publicado en una revista especializada .La mejor apuesta es que la supuesta piedra en realidad no son piedras , continu Parker Pearson . Dijo haber hablado con Gaffney acerca de su interpretacion opuesta . El ao entrant excavaremo para resolv el asunto de una vez por todas , finaliz .An se desconoc cmo el rea de Stoneheng se convirti en un lugar de reverencia . La prueba que causan m intriga estn justo al bord de Stoneheng : tre agujero enorm en lo que se encontraban post de madera parecido a ttem . El carbn y lo hueso encontrado en lo hoyo son del periodo entr 8000 y 7000 a. C .Esto no hace preguntarno si se trata de un lugar especi que ya era reconocido por un pueblo mucho ant de Stonehenge , coment Parker Pearson . E una pregunta que podremo respond algn da .Lo agujero para post son mucho m antiguo que cualquier otro elemento hallado en el rea , salvo el sitio Blick Mead y otro agujero de post cuya fecha de origen se determin recientement .Jacqu inform que lo hueso de animal del lugar , que en su mayora corresponden a uro ( ancestro del ganado moderno ) , ciervo y jabal , datan del 7500 a. C. , lo que lo ubica en la misma poca que lo agujero de post de Stoneheng . La conexin entr ambo es especulativa , pero pued tratars del lugar en que vivan lo constructor de lo ttem de Stoneheng .El mananti del lugar est lleno de herramienta de piedra y pedazo de hueso . Jacqu describ a Blick Mead como un posibl precursor de la celebracion de Durrington Wall .Al alimentars del subsuelo , el mananti nunca se congela , y es posibl que tambin pareciera mgico por otro motivo .Hace alguno ao , la madr de Jacqu , una voluntaria en el sitio , sac del mananti una roca de apariencia interesant y la coloc en su bolsillo . Una hora m tard , haba tomado un color rosa intenso por la reaccin de la alga de la roca con el oxgeno .Esta alga crecen nicament en cierta condicion de sombra parcial , que quiz no han cambiado mucho en 9.500 ao . Empezamo a descubrir que est lugar es especi y en l ocurren cosa especiales , dijo Jacqu .Espera ampliar la excavacion para buscar no slo una casa , sino todo un pueblo .Esta persona son lo primero habitant britnicos , afirm Jacqu . Encontramo la cuna de Stonehenge .Al concluir la impresionant fase de construccin de Stoneheng , cerca del 2400 a. C. , el monumento fue alterado , pero ya haba terminado la era de construccin de mega monumento .En esencia , fue cuando cambi su mundo , indic Parker Pearson . Persona nueva cruzaron el canal desd Europa , e introdujeron bronc y objeto de metal a la cultura de la edad de piedra . E un cambio muy interesante , puntualiz . En cierta forma , Stoneheng fue el ltimo acto .Sigu a NYT Amrica en Facebook y Twitter para leer m artculo de The New York Time en espaol .', 'AMESBURi , England  About 6,300 year ago , a tree here toppl over .For the ancient in thi part of southern England , it creat a prime real estat opportun  next to a spring and near attract hunt ground .Accord to David Jacqu , an archaeologist at the Univers of Buckingham , mud wa press into the pulled-up root , turn them into a wall . Nearbi , a post wa insert into a hole , and that may have held up a roof of reed or anim skin .It wa , he said , a hous , one of the earliest in England .Last month , in the latest excav at a site known as Blick Mead , Mr. Jacqu and hi team dug a trench 40 feet long , 23 feet wide and 5 feet deep , examin thi structur and it surround . They found a hearth with chunk of heat-crack flint , piec of bone , flake of flint use for arrowhead and cut tool , and ocher pod that may have been use as a pigment .There nois here ,  Mr. Jacqu said , imagin the goings-on in 4300 B.C . There peopl here do stuff . Just like us . Same kid and worries.About a mile away is Stoneheng .For Mr. Jacqu , the hous is part of the stori of Stoneheng , even though the occup of the Blick Mead home never saw that assemblag of massiv stone . The begin of Stoneheng were more than a millennium in the futur .But Blick Mead , he said , help fill in the sweep of hunter-gather who becam farmer and then built Stoneheng and other prehistor monument dot the English countrysid .Thi is the first unknown chapter of Stoneheng ,  Mr. Jacqu said .Stoneheng ha captiv gener after gener . Archaeologist have over the year catalog the rock , divin mean from their placement  line up for midsumm sunris and midwint sunset  and studi anim and human bone buri there . They have also long known about the other monument  burial chamber , a 130-foot-tal mound of chalk known as Silburi Hill and mani other circular structur . An aerial survey in 1925 reveal circl of timber , now call Woodheng , two mile from Stoneheng .The stone monument is icon ,  said Wolfgang Neubauer , the director of the Ludwig Boltzmann Institut for Archaeolog Prospect and Virtual Archaeolog in Vienna . But it onli a littl part of the whole thing.Discoveri in the last decad , some via modern technolog like ground-penetr radar , have reveal more about the peopl for whom the giant monument held great mean .The stori of Britain start at the end of the last ice age . In the cold , Britain empti of peopl . With so much ocean water frozen in glacier , sea level wa lower , and Britain wa connect to the rest of Europ . As the world warm , they walk back until rise water sever the land bridg .Around 3800 B.C . the first larg monument appear  rectangular mound known as long barrow that serv as burial chamber .Around 3500 B.C. , a two-mile-long , 100-yard-wid ditch wa dug close to the Stoneheng site , what is known as the Stoneheng Cursu . ( Cursu is Latin for racetrack ; the discover in the 18th centuri thought it wa a Roman racetrack . )The first stage of Stoneheng itself , a circular foundat ditch , wa carv around 2900 B.C. , and ring of timber were erect .About 400 year later came a heyday of heng . ( The defin characterist of a heng is not the rock or timber stick upward , but a circular ditch surround by a rais bank . In thi sens , Stoneheng today is not a true heng ; it rais bank is insid the ditch . )Twenti mile north of Stoneheng is Aveburi , with three stone circl , the outermost more than 1,000 feet in diamet , so larg that the town of Aveburi ha spread into the heng ; at the center is a pub , the Red Lion , found four centuri ago .Closer to Stoneheng is Durrington Wall , a circular earthen structur about 1,600 feet in diamet .Michael Parker Pearson of Univers Colleg London ha excav hous at Durrington Wall and along the nearbi River Avon , and he ha propos thi is where the builder live for the grandest stage of Stonehenge construct , which start around 2600 B.C . The giant stone , weigh some 40 ton , were move and carv . He believ smaller blueston , about two ton each , had been taken to Stoneheng dure the initi construct from the Prese mountain in Wale and now more , larger one were haul over .Becaus earli Briton had no written languag , the simplest question  Whi wa it built ?  ha yet to be conclus answer .In Dr. Parker Pearson view , Durrington Wall wa the land of the live , symbol by the timber of Woodheng , while Stoneheng wa the land of the dead . He believ earli Briton gather at Durrington Wall to feast and then proceed to Stoneheng to honor their ancestor .Last month in the journal Antiqu , Dr. Parker Pearson and hi colleagu describ fatti acid residu they identifi on the insid of cook pot .Wev got the menu ,  he said : beef and pork , boil and grill , with a smatter of appl , berri and hazelnut . Theyr basic eat a veri meat-heavi diet.Peopl came from near and far for the festiv , Dr. Parker Pearson said . He said analysi of cattl teeth show differ isotop of the element strontium , which vari base on the local miner in the water , indic the anim had been rais elsewher and then taken to Durrington Wall .Timothi Darvil of Bournemouth Univers , who conduct a small excav at Stoneheng in 2008 , ha a differ idea about the monument signific , point to the blueston , which he said were not ad to the monument until the second phase , around 2500 B.C. , and in legend posess heal power . Those stone are pretti special ,  Dr. Darvil said . Perhap their signific wasnt fulli understood.He said that Stoneheng origin may have been the land of the dead ,  as Dr. Parker Pearson assert . But Stoneheng later becam more like a prehistor Lourd , where peopl came seek heal , Dr. Darvil said . We see Stoneheng more as a place for the live ,  he said .Much more may lie beneath the surfac .We presum the bit we knew about are the import one ,  said Vincent Gaffney of the Univers of Bradford . What we need to do is to find out realli what is out there.The idea of use ground-penetr radar and magnetomet to peer into the ground without dig goe back decad . In recent year , the equip  particularli the comput to analyz the data  ha becom cheap enough and fast enough to be wide use in archaeolog .Dr. Neubauer collabor with Dr. Gaffney to survey eight squar mile around Stoneheng and Durrington Wall . It been like an armi move across it ,  Dr. Gaffney said .In Septemb , they announc a surpris claim : Buri in the bank of Durrington Wall are about 90 stand stone , some up to 15 feet tall . Dr. Gaffney said there may origin have been 200 , more than twice as mani as at Stoneheng . That tell you the scale of thi thing ,  he said .If true , that would jumbl Dr. Parker Pearson differenti of Durrington Wall as the land of the live from Stoneheng , the land of the dead . But he is skeptic of the find , which have not been publish in a peer-review journal .He said that a decad ago , he excav some of those locat and found post hole that had been cap with cement chalk . The radar reflect had bounc off the chalk block , he said .The smart money is that the stone are not actual stone ,  Dr. Parker Pearson said . He said he and Dr. Gaffney had discuss their differ interpret . Well dig a hole next year to resolv the issu onc and for all ,  he said .Still unknown is how the Stoneheng area becam a rever site . The most intrigu evid is right next to Stoneheng itself  three big post hole that held tall totemlik timber pole . Charcoal and bone in the pit have been date between 8000 and 7000 B.C .It rais the issu whether you have a special place alreadi recogn by a peopl a long , long time befor Stoneheng ,  Dr. Parker Pearson said . That is a question one day well be abl to resolve.The post hole are far older than anyth in the area except the Blick Mead site and one other newli date post hole .Mr. Jacqu said that anim bone there  mostli auroch , the big ancestor of modern cattl , but also red deer and boar  date to 7500 B.C. , overlap the Stoneheng post hole . The connect between the two is specul , but thi might be where the builder of the Stoneheng totem live .The spring there is full of flint tool and discard bone . Mr. Jacqu paint a pictur of Blick Mead as perhap a precursor of the Durrington Wall celebr .Fed from underground , the spring never freez , and it may have seem magic in anoth way , too .A few year ago , a volunt  Mr. Jacques mother  pull an interesting-look rock out of the spring and put it in her pocket . A few hour later , it had turn hot pink  a reaction of alga on the rock to oxygen in the air .The alga grow onli in certain partli shadow condit , and those condit may not have chang much in 9,500 year . Wer start to realiz thi is a special place where special thing are go on ,  Mr. Jacqu said .He hope to expand the dig to look for not just a hous but a villag .These peopl are the first Briton ,  Mr. Jacqu said . Wev found the cradl to Stonehenge.After the end of the grand construct phase of Stoneheng , around 2400 B.C. , the monument wa alter , but the era of megamonu build wa over .That basic when their world chang ,  Dr. Parker Pearson said . New peopl cross the channel from Europ , bring bronz and metalmak to the stone age cultur . It a veri interest shift ,  he said . In a way , Stoneheng is a swan song.', 'MOUNTAIN VIEW , Calif.

But no . About half these profession said they wouldnt worri about potenti harm from the man rigor treatment regimen .Evid is accumul that older adult with diabet , hypertens and other condit should be treat less aggress than they commonli are . Deintensif ,  the Michigan research have name thi approach .As thi and anoth relat recent studi have shown , not for the first time , get that messag out to practic physician ha prove difficult .In our health care system , we are all more scare of fail to do someth than of do too much ,  said Dr. Jeremi Sussman , a primari care physician and research scientist at the Ann Arbor hospit .Under current guidelin , most older patient with diabet dont have to get their blood sugar to rock bottom ; a 7.5 or 8 percent HbA1c produc the same benefit as veri low glucos .Blood pressur read , too , should be allow to rise as patient age  up to 150 millimet of mercuri for systol pressur . The previou goal wa to keep it below 140 .Complic thi question , a larg trial of intens blood-pressur control , announc Monday in The New England Journal of Medicin , found that patient random to an extrem low blood pressur goal  120 millimet of mercuri or below  in fact did see substanti lower death rate . The benefit wa seen in patient over age 75 .But the new trial did not includ peopl with diabet , who are at higher risk for cardiovascular problem . A wide cite studi call Accord , publish in 2008 in The New England Journal of Medicin , found that intens therapi to reduc blood glucos actual result in higher mortal . Expect debat among those who treat older patient about how to appli these result .Gener , there are good reason to be less vigil . In older peopl with diabet , for instanc , maintain veri low blood sugar  often call tight control  can do more harm than good . Peopl can feel fatigu and weak , get cold sweat , feel like theyr go to pass out ,  said Dr. Tanner Caverli , lead author of the Michigan survey , publish in JAMA Intern Medicin . The faint and fall that may result can have devast consequ .Yet a larg nation studi by Dr. Sussman and hi colleagu , publish last month in JAMA Intern Medicin , reveal how rare deintensif occur among patient over age 70 .Review Veteran Affair data on more than 211,000 patient , the research found that fewer than 19 percent of those with veri low blood pressur had scale back their medic . Onli 27 percent of those with veri low blood sugar had done so .There been a huge effort to ensur that fewer peopl are undertr ,  Dr. Sussman said . Now , mayb wev cross the line and too mani peopl are overtreated.Exampl of both extrem are easi to find .Among older adult , substanti proport still dont take advantag of vaccin , among the simplest of health protect . A third of those over age 65 didnt get flu shot last season , accord to data from the Center for Diseas Control and Prevent . More than 40 percent havent been vaccin against pneumonia , and fewer than a quarter have gotten the shingl vaccin .But older American receiv too mani colonoscopi and too mani mammogram . Last year , a studi found that more than half of nurs home resid with advanc dementia , a termin diseas , were receiv drug of question valu ; about a fifth took statin to lower cholesterol .Overtreat , howev , rare bring the sort of hand-wring that undertreat doe . You might think it would be welcom news that older diabet can do well with lower dose of medic , and that in some case they might be abl to stop take glucose-low drug altogeth .Tight control take great effort , and it make sens for young and middle-ag peopl with diabet . The benefit accru slowli , over year , so younger patient are more apt to receiv them . The young have stronger bone and better balanc , so they are less like to be injur in the fall that too-low blood sugar can caus .Older , frailer peopl with lower life expect and mani addit health problem face differ trade-off .A you get older , the benefit go down and the risk go up ,  said Dr. Sei Lee , a geriatrician at the Univers of California , San Francisco , who ha written about the subject for year . What wa good for you at 55 might be bad for you at 75.As a member of the American Geriatr Society Choos Wise panel , Dr. Lee help draft it recommend that a 7 to 7.5 percent A1c target is a reason goal for healthi senior . For those with addit health problem and life expect of less than 10 year , the panel suggest a 7.5 to 8 percent goal , rise to 8 to 9 percent for those with mani medic condit and few year ahead .Given all that , it disappoint that more primari care provid in the new Veteran Affair studi never thought to tell our fiction 77-year-old that he could afford to let hi blood glucos rise a bit , and mayb eat a cooki onc in a while . But sometim patient themselv resist , especi if they have been duti monitor their diseas for year .Dr. Sussman recal a veteran , about 80 , who took pride in the way hed manag hi ill , test hi blood sever time a day , inject insulin , keep hi glucos below 7 . He had lost weight with age , howev , so Dr. Sussman suggest he stop insulin shot and begin take the diabet drug metformin , which come in pill form .The man gave it a tri . But he and hi wife never lost their discomfort with do less than they had been ,  Dr. Sussman said . The patient went back to the inject .At least hi doctor had point out the option and explain the like benefit . In the new Veteran Affair studi , nearli 30 percent of respond said they lack the time to discuss the risk and benefit . About a quarter said they fear that reduc the fiction patient medic could make them vulner to a lawsuit .More than 40 percent worri that higher blood glucos would violat their institutions perform measur , the report card doctor get  even though the Depart of Veteran Affair ha never specifi a target below 7 percent for these patient .Just the contrari : The depart last year announc a Nation Hypoglycem Safeti Initi , chang it approach to diabet manag to avoid intens treatment when it not warrant .Still , older adult who havent reassess their diabet or blood pressur regimen for year probabl should be ask their doctor if they can or should make chang . The doctor , for now , might not rais the subject themselv .It one thing to find out about someth new and excit and do it ,  Dr. Sussman reflect .

But as to student  how about fire a laser at a methan bubbl to set it aflam ?Light up methan is not exactli scienc , but if you record the result at 10,000 frame a second with a techniqu call schlieren imag  which the student themselv have to master  and then requir them to figur out how to comput the speed at which the flame grow base on the video , your readi for graduat student at Stanford .Dr. Miller , a research at Stanford ; Chri Goldenstein , anoth research ; and Valeri Troutman , a Ph.D. student , recent work with graduat student in engin at Stanford to produc and analyz just such video .The video , like one of a match fire up that wa creat last year by Dr. Miller and other , are in black and white , and the techniqu requir veri exact placement of the camera , light sourc and mirror to captur differ in densiti among the turbul hot gase as the flame grow .Dr. Miller said he and hi colleagu were prepar for a lab cours in optic diagnost and spectroscopy in which graduat student must use schlieren imag when they came up with the plan . Last year , Dr. Miller had done the match video for thi cours and it won an award at a meet of the Divis of Fluid Dynam of the American Physic Societi . It wa also featur in ScienceTak .Thi time , he want to do someth differ , and Dr. Miller said that Dr. Goldenstein wa the one who suggest , we should fill up bubbl with methan and light them. He had seen it done befor , and Dr. Miller thought it seem like a great idea . So they supervis the student set up a camera , laser , light sourc and mirror at exactli the right posit and angl , which is the difficult part .The student love it , Dr. Miller said . Then , use the video , the student had to figur out a way to measur the flame speed . He see a wider use for the techniqu , perhap with less complic analysi .Thi could be a realli fun thing to have in K-12 classroom ,  he said . He said that two smartphon could serv as camera and light sourc . They wouldnt record at the same high speed as the camera he use , but some smartphon have slow-mot abil .And he say a 3-D printer could be program to make frame to hold the mirror and camera , solv the problem of get exactli the right angl .Anyon want to go back to middl school ?', 'MONTAGU , Mass .  Think of all the dog out there : labrador and poodl and labradoodl ; huski and westi and dogu de Bordeaux ; pit bull and spaniel and lovabl mutt that go to doggi day care .Add them up , all the pet dog on the planet , and you get about 250 million .But there are about a billion dog on Earth , accord to some estim . The other 750 million dont have flea collar . And they certainli dont have human who take them for walk and pick up their fece . They are call villag dog , street dog and free-breed dog , among other thing , and they haunt the garbag dump and neighborhood of most of the world .In their new book , What Is a Dog ? ,  Raymond and Lorna Copping argu that if you realli want to understand the natur of dog , you need to know these other anim . The vast major are not stray or lost pet , the Copping say , but rather superbl adapt scaveng  the closest live thing to the dog that first emerg thousand of year ago .Other scientist disagre about the genet of the dog , but acknowledg that three-quart of a billion dog are well worth studi .The Copping have been major figur in canin scienc for decad . Raymond Copping wa one of the found professor at Hampshir Colleg in Amherst , and he and Lorna , a biologist and scienc writer , have done groundbreak work on sled dog , herd dog , sheep-guard dog , and the origin and evolut of dog .Wev done everyth togeth ,  he said recent as they sat on the porch of the hous they built , set on about 100 acr of land , and talk at length about dog , villag and otherwis , and the root of their deep interest in the anim .Both had dog as children . Lorna had sever kind . An uncl brought Ray hi first dog , a pup from a femal that hung around a load ramp at a chemic plant in Cambridg , Mass . He live to be 17  he look like ani other villag dog in the world ,  he said . After they graduat from Boston Univers , where they were both undergradu in the late 1950 , they continu to keep them .I gave her a dog for a graduat present ,  he said . It wa reputedli a collie-shepherd mix .After they both graduat , they move to the Amherst area , where Lorna taught Russian and receiv a master degre in wildlif biolog and Ray pursu a Ph.D. in zoolog , both at the Univers of Massachusett . They did field studi togeth , but on differ subject , and then dove deepli into the canin world .A neighbor race sled dog , and one thing led to anoth until Dr. Copping start race them himself and they had a hundr dog hous in cement den on a hill behind hi hous . In 1969 , he join Hampshir Colleg as part of the found faculti , and continu research energi expenditur in the dog . He also develop a win strain by hybrid Alaskan villag dog with Border colli .For the first time in their live togeth , the Copping are now without ani dog at home , and they talk with some nostalgia , more about the bad dog than the good . Like Jane .Worst dog I ever had ,  Dr. Copping said . I could tell you a thousand bad stori about Jane.But ,  he said , put her on a mountain pass behind 3,000 sheep , and shed worri them all the way up the mountain and pick up the stray and everything.They dont miss have dog by the score , but Ms. Copping said , I miss the pet dogs. The last , who die in 2013 , wa Poppyse Shackleton , a Jack Russel terrier who belong to their grandchildren , but live with them .One benefit , howev , is that they are enjoy observ a flood of wildlif that avoid their land when so mani dog were around  vultur , fox , deer and other anim .In the earli 1970 , they began studi sheep-guard dog and travel around the world find dog that sheep herder use . They brought some home and help develop the Anatolian shepherd breed in the Unit State , and start a livestock guarding-dog project at Hampshir to studi how effect dog were in protect sheep and other livestock .In 2001 , their book Dog : A Startl New Understand of Canin Origin , Behavior & Evolution challeng the way scientist thought about the begin of dog .They argu against the wide held view that one day a hunter-gather grab a wolf pup from a den and start a breed program . Instead , they argu , dog domest themselv .Some wild canin start hang around human for their leftov and gradual evolv into scaveng depend on human . Not everyon in canin scienc share that view today , but mani research think it is the most plausibl rout to domest .Dure their travel over the year  to look for sheepdog , to introduc them to sheep farmer who hadnt use dog , to attend confer  they notic dog in the street wherev they went , and after a while they began to think about the dogs live .They were so much more interest than what wed ever done befor ,  Dr. Copping said . Here were anim that had their own uniqu kind of social behavior . So we start to studi them.That wa in the earli 1990 . He work with Luigi Boitani of La Sapienza Univers of Rome , who wa studi urban dog that live off garbag . I taught class in the Mexico Citi dump ,  Dr. Copping said . And the Copping continu to observ villag dog around the world .They argu in their new book that these dog are not mongrel or stray ,  as is often assum . Some lost pet do wander into group of villag dog . But by and larg , these dog are much the same around the world , whether in Africa , Mongolia , China or the America .Dr. Copping said he wa onc told by a Navajo sheep herder that a good herd dog wa not too big and not too small ,  which perfectli describ villag dog , too . They are larger in colder climat , but in the tropic , he said , a 30-pound , lion-color dog is the norm .They are complet polygam . There can be as mani father to a litter of puppi as there are puppi to a litter ,  Dr. Copping said . And after about 10 week , the puppi fend for themselv . Most of the pup dont surviv , as is the case with mani wild anim .They have remark vari connect to human be . Some live complet on their own at dump . Some are neighborhood dog , recogn and perhap given handout by peopl who live in a certain area . Other may feed and breed on their own , but spend night at the home of peopl . Sometim they are adopt by peopl . But realli , Dr. Copping say , it is the dog who adopt human .The number of dog that can surviv in a citi or a neighborhood or at a dump is determin by the avail garbag . The Copping calcul that in the tropic it take about 100 peopl to produc enough garbag to support seven free-liv dog .There is preciou littl fund for studi these dog , except in the context of prevent rabi , which is an enorm problem , with close to 60,000 human death a year , mostli from dog bite . But some scientist have track their behavior . Sunil K. Pal in India ha studi them and written a number of paper on their social live and behavior .The Copping were join for the recent convers at their home by Kathryn Lord , a former student of Dr. Copping and now a research at Hampshir Colleg , who studi the develop and reproduct behavior of dog , includ villag dog . She share her insight on what make a dog a dog , and not a wolf , for exampl . Wolf puppi depend on their parent and other adult regurgit partli digest food .Thi is all but lost in dog ,  she said . It doe happen , but report suggest that in villag dog it may occur sever time a week .Among wolv in the wild , she said , it seven time a day ,  and it is an uncontrol reflex . In one experi , she tri test adult wolv by put them into a pen with unrel pup after a big steak meal .Theyd actual run around with their head in the air to avoid the puppi ,  she said . Eventu theyd lose their lunch. At which point they would run off and let the youngster have at it .The point the Copping and Dr. Lord make about these behavior is not that dog are somehow less care or nobl than wolv , but how perfectli adapt they are to the live they lead .They dont need to be big and strong to bring down prey . They dont need the kind of parent care and hunt instruct that wolf pup get . As Dr. Lord said , dog pup dont need to catch and kill anyth . They need to walk up to a rotten melon and eat it , which they can do at 10 weeks.Puppi , after they are wean , can not compet with adult , so unless diseas or dogcatch have put a dent in the adult popul , most of them starv . They have a true superpow in reserv , howev , that can help them escap their fate . They can convinc a human to feed them .Dr. Copping recal a woman in South Africa who had mani dog in and around her hous . He ask her how it happen that she had so mani dog . I dont know ,  he recal the woman say . They just keep coming.But what are villag dog ? Are they a breed , or a superbre apart ? Or are they just a mixtur of mani breed with origin too messi to trace ?Adam Boyko , a biologist at the Cornel Univers Colleg of Veterinari Medicin , who wa inspir to pursu canin scienc by the Coppingers 2001 book , ha also compil DNA from villag dog around the world . One of hi research paper conclud that villag dog in Mongolia are at the center of dog divers . That suggest that they are geograph nearest to the place where dog first evolv .Other evid ha suggest that dog origin in Europ or China , howev , and Dr. Boyko is one of a number of particip in a major studi be led by Greger Larson at Oxford to use ancient DNA and fossil to clear up some of the confus about the origin of dog .And other villag dog seem to have differ genet makeup . For exampl , Dr. Boyko and hi colleagu analyz DNA sampl from villag dog on remot island in Fiji and French Polynesia that he hope would show a histor pattern of migrat as peopl and their dog move from place to place .Almost without except the dog were 99 percent European ,  he said , mean their ancestor were dog on European ship that came to Pacif island age ago . Dog in other place , like Borneo , he said , show almost no trace of European breed .In a studi publish last fall , Wieslaw Bogdanowicz at the Polish Academi of Scienc in Warsaw led an intern team of scientist in analyz the DNA of free-breed dog in Eurasia . He conclud that these dog were differ from purebr and mix breed .I would like to call them a superbre ,  he said .He also found that modern European street dog trace their ancestri to East Asian dog that migrat with human to Europ . Earlier studi place that migrat sometim between 4,000 and 11,000 year ago .Beyond that , howev , lie the ultim origin of dog , which is still cloud in mysteri . The consensu among scientist is that dog evolv from ancient wolv , perhap one not found in the fossil record , 15,000 or more year ago .Dr. Copping ha suggest that dog evolv after the invent of agricultur , perhap around 8,000 year ago , and that today villag dog are the closest to these first dog . But thi idea ha littl support from other scientist .The Coppingers main goal is to draw attent to the world vast major of dog that are hidden in plain sight . They repres a treasur trove of scientif inform .Although the Copping recogn the social cost of anim that are unvaccin and run free , they argu that kill the dog , as some countri do dure rabi epidem , doe not help . It imposs to kill them all , and becaus they breed rapidli , the popul quickli rebound .Nor do the Copping have ani sympathi for rescu group that , as Dr. Copping put it , kidnap and mutilate street dog from the Caribbean and elsewher to bring them to American shelter to live as pet , where they are made total depend and entir restricted. Thi is suppos to benefit the dog , but Dr. Copping argu that they are taken from a rich social environ , with mani dog , to live of rel isol .What to do ? The Copping suggest a simpl answer . One way or anoth villag dog depend on garbag . If societi want fewer dog in the street , there a surefir solut .Less garbag .', 'The eye-catch headlin on the new find start come in wave . Report : Human DNA Found in Hot Dogs said USA Today , in a typic exampl .Thi bizarr inform came from a singl document releas on Oct. 17 by the consum market arm of a compani call Clear Lab , which had found trace of human DNA in 2 percent of the product sampl .But dont worri : There no evid that hot-dog lover are unwit cannib . It more a matter of hygien in food product . The tiniest particl of hair , nail and skin could show up in these test .Even so , an execut at the compani interview last week wa unapologet about the attention-grab find .It pretti unlik that the human DNA piec is actual harm to consum health ,  said Mahni Ghorashi , a Clear Lab founder . We consid it more of a hygien issu that degrad the qualiti of the food.Snope , the rumor-debunk site , wa rather more harsh , label the inform unproven.Consum should brace themselv for more buzzworthi headlin as genom sequenc get cheaper and Silicon Valley compani like Clear Lab , Beyond Meat and Soylent tri to disrupt eat itself .Chri Dixon , a partner at the ventur capit firm Andreessen Horowitz , an investor in Soylent , said a broad cultur fixat on Silicon Valley is focus attent on new food technolog . Peopl are much more interest in food start-up now , partli becaus they are come out of Silicon Valley , and they have the kind of Silicon Valley approach to thing ,  he said .Beyond Meat , for exampl , is push synthet meat . Biz Stone , a Twitter co-found and investor in the compani , describ the market approach : Grow the brand as big as you can , like a fake it till you make it type of thing , and then back into it with a stellar product.The Clear Lab stori wa an effort to bring market attent to the company use of gene-sequenc technolog , first pioneer by the Human Genom Project . Look at region of the genom call bar code region , the compani identifi trace of anim speci in food sampl , includ those that are not suppos to be there . The Hot Dog Report did contain signific find , notabl that pork had been substitut for chicken and turkey in 3 percent of sampl , and that 10 percent of vegetarian product contain real meat .But it wa the human DNA detail that took off on social media .The focu on market by food start-up should not be surpris . While the technolog is get faster and cheaper , start-up still have to attract investor . The Clear Lab technolog ha been in develop for over two year , cost about $ 8 million in ventur fund to build the platform and databas .Mr. Ghorashi , of Clear Lab , said he expect the number of compani get into the genom sequenc busi to increas .But while it put consider effort in market the Hot Dog Report , Clear Lab refus to name the food brand that it claim were mislead custom .Wev made a consciou choic not to be a whistle-blow group , and we never will be ,  Mr. Ghorashi said . We believ that alien industri will ultim hurt consum more than help them.That expos the start-up to critic . Dan Nosowitz , a journalist who cover the intersect of food and technolog , recent question whether the company find should be avail onli to the entiti that produc and sell the food.Mr. Nosowitz also urg skeptic about Silicon Valley food start-up . They are prone to cherry-pick scientif evid in order to come up with appeal messag for their product , he said .There thi mental that if you can find a studi that say someth , it is irrefut correct ,  he said in an interview , when in fact it chao in the scientif world when it come to nutrition.Ethan Brown , the founder of Beyond Meat , express a view similar to that of Mr. Nosowitz but insist that Silicon Valley approach to technolog wa a good fit for the food industri .I think about our chicken like I think about a big Wang comput at the begin of the comput day ,  he said . It good , it work , it ha some realli good qualiti to it , but it nowher close to what in our lab today.Advoc of Beyond Meat effort to synthes meat from amino acid , carbohydr and fat promot the compani as eco-friendli , an altern for those concern about anim welfar , climat chang and health .But Mr. Brown say that none of that matter if the food doe not pass consumers tast test .

The articl shot to the top of the most-email list , and attract nearli 1,900 comment .In year of read The Time , Iv not seen a finer set of comment than these  at onc thought and empathet ,  wrote Ron Cohen of Waltham , Mass .The data show that the current uptick in mortal rate is driven by increas level of suicid , alcohol and substanc abus specif among less educ white . But mani comment spoke of a broad sens of despair in the countri that cut across demograph line .Hugh Sansom , 50 , of Brooklyn , wrote , I didnt need Ann Case or Angu Deaton to tell me that thing are get wors for American like me . I can not get a job to save my life . Liter . Age discrimin is de facto legal  even applaud  in the U. .

After two decad , I would not know the woman who live next door to me if I met her face to face . She drive her car into the garag , the door shut and she never come out of the hous . My neighbor across the street ha live there for a coupl year ; same realiti . It seem they go out of their way to make sure not to make eye contact or cast a friendli wave .

After her famili move from suburban New Hampshir to the wind-whip plain of southeastern Wyom , Monica Morin embrac small-town life , forg last friendship and celebr her own quirki style .Dark-hair , with hipster glass and a disarm sens of humor , Monica wa a why-not kind of kid ,  her mother , Kim Morin , said . The kind who would wear a giraff costum to the groceri store , just becaus .Last year , dure Monica sophomor year of high school , her mood began to darken . She turn to alcohol and marijuana , and some day withdrew from the close relationship she had alway had with her parent , who , although long divorc , remain friend and partner in rais their onli child . After her descent into drink , she start cut herself .Ms. Morin wa alarm , awar that famili histori wa not in her daughter favor . Her sister had develop bipolar disord in her teen , eventu drink herself to death . Her father had taken hi own life when Ms. Morin wa 19 .Monica parent sought help for their daughter despair , drive her two and a half hour to Casper for inpati treatment . As the year drew to a close , Monica seem to be improv , cling to a fragil stabil with twice-weekli counsel .On the afternoon of Feb. 4 , after Monica and her mother return to their apart from a doctor appoint , Monica said she need to finish homework in her room . Some time later , she took a shower and ask her mother if they could snuggl on the sofa and watch a movi befor go to bed .I love you , Mom ,  she said , as Ms. Morin stroke her hair .Not long into the film , Monica suffer a seizur . The paramed who respond to Ms. Morin frantic call search Monica room and discov an empti bottl of over-the-count allergi pill pilfer from her mother medicin cabinet . She die at Ivinson Memori Hospit that night .You replay everyth in your head ,  Ms. Morin said in her live room recent , her voic shake . Wonder what els you could have done.Stori like Monica unfold with disturb frequenc across small-town America .Rural adolesc commit suicid at roughli twice the rate of their urban peer , accord to a studi publish in the May issu of the journal JAMA Pediatr . Although imbal between citi and countri have long persist , we werent expect that the dispar would be increas over time ,  said the study lead author , Cynthia Fontanella , a psychologist at Ohio State Univers .The rate are higher , and the gap is get wider.Suicid is a threat not just to the young . Rate over all rose 7 percent in metropolitan counti from 2004 to 2013 , accord to the Center for Diseas Control and Prevent . In rural counti , the increas wa 20 percent .The problem reach across demograph boundari , encompass such group as older men , Nativ American and veteran . The son and daughter of small town are more like to serv in the militari , and nearli half of Iraq and Afghanistan veteran live in rural commun .The C.D.C . report last year that Wyom ha the highest suicid rate in the nation , almost 30 death per 100,000 peopl in 2012 , far abov the nation averag of 12.6 per 100,000 . Not far behind were Alaska , Montana , New Mexico and Utah , all state where isol can be common . The villag of Hooper Bay , Alaska , recent record four suicid in two week .In one telephon survey of 1,000 Wyom resid , half of those who respond said someon close to them had attempt or die by suicid .In Septemb , mental health expert , commun volunt and law enforc offic gather in Casper to discuss possibl solut . Among the particip wa Bobbi Barrasso , the wife of Senat John Barrasso , who ha made suicid prevent a person and polit mission .Wyom is a beauti state ,  she told the crowd . We have great open space . We are a state of small popul . We care about one anoth . Wer resourc , wer resili , we cowboy up . And of cours , Iv learn it those veri thing that have led to a high incid of suicid in our state.Rural suicid aris from all the circumst Ms. Barrasso note and more . Despit a sleepi Mayberry sort of imag , the realiti of small-town life can take an outsiz toll on the vulner . A combin of lower incom , greater isol , famili issu and health problem can lead peopl to be consum by day-to-day struggl , said Emili Selby-Nelson , a psychologist at Cabin Creek Health System , which provid health care in the rural hill of West Virginia .Rather than say , I need help ,  they keep work and they get overwhelm . They can start to think they are a burden on their famili and lose hope.Countri life can be lone for peopl in the grip of mental ill or emot upheav , and the mean to follow through on suicid thought are close at hand . Firearm , the most common method , are a pervas part of the cultur ; 51 percent of rural household own a gun , compar with 25 percent of urban home , the Pew Research Center report last year .Expert also note a mind-set , born long ago of necess , dictat that peopl solv their own problem .Leonard Jacob , who grew up in southeast Iowa , move to Larami when hi wife , Sarah , enrol in law school at the Univers of Wyom . After 9/11 , he enlist in the Marin Corp , and he spent a year deploy in Iraq in 2005 .He came back a differ man , Ms. Jacob said  prone to anger and paranoia , troubl by nightmar and obsess over cleanli and order . He refus to discuss the war and insist on tri to fix himself , just as he had their car , their dishwash and anyth els in need of repair .Eventu , fear for the safeti of their two children , Ms. Jacob file for divorc . The day she brought him the final paper , in Februari 2014 , he retriev a gun she had never seen from hi truck and end hi life as she watch , horrifi . It wa their son birthday .Mr. Jacob never sought help . Ms. Jacob say her husband sens of self-suffici combin with a fear of stigma to keep him from treatment . For him , it wa like admit weak ,  she said .Stigma is not uniqu to rural life , but it can becom more acut in place where it hard to disappear into anonym . Ms. Jacob said she experienc thi as she sought counsel for her own distress , walk past the awkward gaze of her client in the wait room .A lack of privaci can deter peopl from seek treatment . If someone car is there at the known psychologist offic or mental health provider offic , then of cours other in the commun know ,  said Bryant Smalley , the execut director of the Rural Health Research Institut at Georgia Southern Univers .Even in case like Monica Morin , where famili desper seek help , proper care can be hard to find .Kim Morin learn that Larami wa not equip to address her daughter complex need . The Depart of Health and Human Servic report that 55 percent of counti in the Unit State  all of them rural  do not have a singl psychologist , psychiatrist or social worker .Self-med with alcohol and drug can add to the challeng , and a studi thi year in The American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abus note that rural treatment center have reduc access to highli educ counselors.Volunt in Wyom are tri to promot chang from the bottom up , train citizen to talk to someon who may be in danger of hurt themselv . The program ha been adopt by some of the state largest employ , commun organ and church , said Terresa Humphries-Wadsworth , a psychologist in Codi who is the statewid director of suicid prevent for the nonprofit Prevent Manag Organ of Wyom .Sinc the effort began two year ago , she said , referr rate to mental health servic are rise . She caution that meaning chang took time , but said , A we continu , we should see suicid rate come down , becaus peopl are get help earlier and earlier.In Wyom and other rural set , medic practic also are tri to integr mental health treatment into a varieti of set . Patient reluct to see a psychologist may nonetheless visit a doctor with vagu complaint , such as headach or troubl sleep . A 2002 analysi publish in The American Journal of Psychiatri found that 45 percent of peopl who commit suicid had visit their primari care provid within the previou month .Identifi at-risk patient in privat doctors offic or ad a mental health compon to a public clinic can catch peopl who would otherwis avoid be seen at an offic obvious associ with mental health .Thi is the same place they go for a cold and flu ; noth look differ ,  said Dr. Selby-Nelson , whose offic in West Virginia is in the same build and even ha the same sign-in desk as other medic servic , give her patient a greater sens of privaci .The Afford Care Act ha help increas access by encourag whole patient coverag that includ behavior mental health , she said . An evalu of the idea publish in Gener Hospit Psychiatri in 2013 conclud that ad psycholog servic to a primari care offic led to greater access and patient satisfact .Technolog may also provid an answer , enabl doctor to reach patient in underserv area via live video chat stream to comput , televis screen and iPad in clinic and school .With psychiatri , the equival of a physic exam is a mental statu examin , most of which can be done quit well with video conferenc ,  said Dr. Kathleen Myer , the director of telement health servic at Seattl Children Hospit , which just complet a five-year evalu of the concept .The ideal  what I think everybodi want  is that some primari care practic would have a confer room or a room next door where doc could just refer in their patient and a psychiatrist would see them ,  Dr. Myer said .Although such examin are promis , logist challeng remain .

It inaugur voyag in 1976 , from Hawaii to Tahiti , wa a 2,500-nautical-mil journey mark by a raucou arriv in Papeet Harbor in front of 17,000 peopl , accord to the societi .Sinc then , the cano ha been travel around the Pacif tri to help settl the debat about the origin of earli Polynesian settler . In hi 1947 Kon-Tiki expedit , the Norwegian explor Thor Heyerdahl sail from South America to Polynesia on a raft with no modern navig equip to demonstr that South American could have settl Polynesia the same way . Heyerdahl hypothesi wa never embrac by most scholar ; still , Hokulea ha prove Polynesian were more than capabl of the feat .Polynesia wa not settl by landlubb who drift haplessli with the prevail wind and current from South America on primit raft , but by real seamen who ventur out into the ocean void at about the time when the wall of Troy were fall to the Greek ,  the Hawaiian author Sam Low wrote recent .Last year , Hokulea embark on a new journey , with a more urgent purpos : a three-year circumnavig of the globe  more than 60,000 nautic mile  with event along the way aim at draw attent to the effect of climat chang on the ocean .Lead the expedit is Nainoa Thompson , the presid of the Polynesian Voyag Societi and one of just a hand of navig train in wayfind . Born in Hawaii , Mr. Thompson went to colleg in Oregon befor return home to join the first Hokulea crew . When Hokulea first set out in 1976 , it wa thank to Mau Piailug , a seafar from a small Micronesian island call Sataw who had taught Mr. Thompson the old way .It wa a long trip , 31 day , and there were a lot of unknown ,  Mr. Thompson recal dure a recent visit to New York to drum up support for Hokulea journey . None of the crew member knew each other , and no one realli knew what wa go on.Mr. Piailug return to Hawaii in 1979 to train Mr. Thompson to take over sail Hokulea . ( He die in 2010 at age 78 . )On hi first day , Mr. Piailug took stone from the garden and made a map of the star on the ground , Mr. Thompson said . Slowli , he learn to pay attent to ocean current and read the weather from the color of the light at dawn .Sinc then , he ha guid the cano on six major voyag total more than 140,000 nautic mile , inspir a reviv of cano build and wayfind . Accord to the Polynesian Voyag Societi , there are now 25 deep-sea voyag cano in the Pacif , and more than 2,000 activ voyag from 11 Pacif Island nation .Mr. Thompson spent six year repair Hokulea and train 350 crew member in prepar for the canoe global voyag . ( At ani given time , Hokulea ha 11 to 13 crew member aboard who rotat in and out everi four to six week . ) In particular , he focus on pass on the core concept of tradit wayfind to younger crew member who he believ will be commit to share them with the next gener .One of those is Jenna Ishii , a 29-year-old apprentic navig who also work as an educ coordin for the Polynesian Voyag Societi . On train sail , she said , Mr. Thompson teach apprentic skill like how to stand and sleep simultan  he will stand up and put hi hand on the rail with hi elbow lock so that he can sleep for a few minut at a time ,  she said  and how to observ the ocean and the sky for cue .Nainoa say that a navig will make over 1,000 observ a day , and make two key decis  at sunris and sunset  about how far you have gone and where to go next ,  Ms. Ishii said . Thi includ plot a cours that will ensur the cano travel upwind for most of the journey befor switch to downwind to reach it destin , avoid what is known as tack  sail back and forth against the wind .While the crew aboard Hokulea will , for the most part , use wayfind techniqu , the cano is equip with modern instrument in case of emerg , and to navig around more danger strait and channel , like the Mozambiqu Channel and the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa .If we can navig without them , we will ,  Ms. Ishii said . But if the weather compromis us , or it becom an issu of speed , we will use instruments.Crew member document their day at sea , blog and post video ; the Hokulea websit ha a live track map show the locat of each cano and it intend path around the world , but crew member are forbidden to consult it . Sometim , crew member invit student to particip in Googl hangout session , in which the student are under strict order not to reveal the exact posit of the cano to the crew . Even watch are strictli forbidden onboard , becaus they can be use to determin speed .Ha ani crew member ever been tempt to simpli Googl Hokulea posit ?Your so commit to the journey that it would be a shame ,  Ms. Ishii said . No one will break tradition.Mr. Thompson ad : To be given inform would be an insult . It take away the challenge.Still , slip-up have been known to happen . Navig are no longer allow to be the primari commun on the cano , but Ms. Ishii rememb a radio transmiss in which the oper had innoc announc the canoe posit .It make you want to cri ,  she said .', 'Menlo Park , Calif.  Almost half a centuri ago , the first autonom robot project , dub Shakey , wa start here at a laboratori that is now call SRI Intern . Shakey wa the first machin use to pursu a rang of artifici intellig technolog such as plan , navig , machin vision and even speech recognit . Fund by the Pentagon , it wa origin model on the idea of an autonom sentri for a militari base .Last week , on a warm fall afternoon outsid the offic of a ventur capit firm not far from the origin SRI experi , a distant descend of the origin Shakey wa wheel out for a demonstr . While Shakey wa mostli a bulki stack of electron , the modern version is sleeker and more nimbl , and look like an overs cooler on wheel with LED light and video camera .It ha been develop by Starship Technolog , an Estonian start-up creat and fund by the Skype co-found Ahti Heinla and Janu Frii . The two men are programm and entrepreneur who are plan to use reason straightforward autonom navig technolog to solv what is describ as the last mile problem  get good like groceri , drugstor item and most small packag to suburban home .Their task is simpler than the one face design of self-driv car , becaus if someth goe wrong , the Starship robot is much less like to caus harm . While Amazon and Googl are pursu the idea of use airborn drone to deliv packag in urban area , Mr. Heinla , who serv as the chief technolog offic for Starship , believ hi ground-bas approach is more practic .Dure a demonstr last week , the robot didnt do a lot . It roll along jauntili while wave a protrud LED-lit antenna-lik a flag to make it more notic .But it may be a glimps of a futur in which intellig and autonom machin transport human , deliv packag and perform servic .Mr. Heinla vision is that a custom will place an onlin order and then the pint-siz Starship autonom deliveri vehicl will be automat load at a compact warehous made from a convert cargo contain that can be place in a park lot or elsewher in a shop district . The Starship autonom vehicl will then set out on sidewalk at a top speed of four mile an hour . It will have a rang of up to two mile and be abl to deliv packag in under a half-hour .Current the biggest problem the logist compani have is with last-mil deliveri ,  Mr. Heinla said . When the van is stop everi coupl of minut to knock on anoth door , thi is the biggest sourc of inefficiency.The idea is that the knee-high vehicl will roll up in front of home and custom will walk outsid and touch a button on their smartphon applic to give them access to the groceri or packag insid . The six-wheel Starship robot vehicl , power by an electr motor that consum just 50 watt , will then trundl back to it modular warehous to be recharg .The prototyp ha the capac to carri a payload of 40 pound , or roughli two bag of groceri . It will travel through neighborhood that have been pre-map at high resolut and will have camera and radar to see the world around it as it travel . By not use costli Lidar sensor that are capabl of detect object as small as a pebbl hundr of feet away and that are be use on Google and other autonom vehicl , the robot will cost to less to build . It will also have speaker and microphon for commun with ani human it might encount .In theori , it will toppl one more obstacl to onlin shop . Accord to Brad Templeton , a softwar design base in Silicon Valley and an advis to Starship , a low-cost deliveri robot like Starship will make it possibl for custom to tri out or tri on product while the robot wait . If they dont like what they have purchas , the robot can then return it at almost no cost .The system is not intend for crowd urban environ , Mr. Heinla acknowledg . Rather it is target for rel affluent and uncrowd suburban neighborhood , gate commun , assist live facil and campus , where it will travel on sidewalk , program to mingl freeli with pedestrian , bicyclist and car .Theft is certainli a concern , but the Starship design point out that ani thiev will have to run the risk of expos themselv to high resolut video camera as well as a GP track system that will need to be disabl .The biggest technic challeng will be cross intersect . To help with thi hurdl , each vehicl will have the abil to call on a remot human oper whenev it face a navig puzzl it autonom softwar can not solv . When it confront a pedestrian on a sidewalk , the vehicl come to a halt until the human pass . The Starship robot is design to make deliveri for a cost of less than $ 1 , which Mr. Heinla say is five to 15 time as cheap as current human-driven deliveri vehicl .Mr. Heinla , who help develop the Kazaa file-shar servic befor Skype , say hi 30-person Estonian firm will start it first experiment deliveri system in Greenwich , England , and the Unit State next spring . Commerci servic is plan for 2017 . The system will also provid environment benefit by reduc gas-pow vehicl traffic , he said .There are of cours both practic and regulatori obstacl that need to be overcom . For exampl , today in the Unit State , onli a hand of state would allow such an autonom vehicl to travel on the sidewalk . In some case , citi may be abl to offer legal exempt to allow the vehicl to travel on sidewalk in specif neighborhood .Allan Martinson , Starship chief oper offic , note that new technolog often requir regulatori chang , and point out that the Segway two-wheel motor transport vehicl wa abl to get such exempt in mani locat .For Peter Hart , an artifici intellig specialist who wa one of the leader of the origin Shakey project , there is a deeper messag in the emerg of system like the Starship robot .After Shakey , artifici intellig and robot went their separ way ,  he said .

The eastern Pacif hurrican strengthen explos befor hit the coast of Mexico , far exceed project of scientist who studi such storm .And while the storm strength dissip quickli when it struck land , a question remain . What made it such a monster ?Explan were all over the map , with theori that includ climat chang ( or not ) , and El Nio .But the answer is more complic . The interplay of all the differ kind of warm go on in the Pacif at the moment can be difficult to sort out and , as with the recent hurrican , attribut a weather event to a singl caus is unrealist .Gabriel Vecchi , head of the climat variat and predict group at the geophys fluid dynam laboratori of the Nation Ocean and Atmospher Administr in Princeton , N.J. , liken the challeng to the board game Clue .There all these suspect , and we have them all in the room right now ,  he said . The key is to go and systemat figur out who wa where and when , so we can exclud peopl or phenomena. Extend the metaphor , he note that crimin suspect could work togeth as accomplic , and there could be a charact not yet known . And , as in all mysteri , You can have a twist ending.At the moment , the world largest ocean is a troublesom place , creat storm and caus problem for peopl and marin life across the Pacif Rim and beyond . A partial list includ the strong El Nio system that ha form along the Equat , and anoth unusu persist zone of warm water that ha been sit off the North American coast , wryli call the Blob.And a longer-term cycl of heat and cool known as the Pacif Decad Oscil may be switch from a cool phase to a warm phase . On top of all that is the grind progress of climat chang , caus by accumul of greenhous gase gener by human activ .Each of these phenomena oper on a differ time scale , but for now they appear to be synchron , a littl like the way the second hand , minut hand and hour hand line up at the stroke of midnight . And the collect effect could be veri power .Although they interact with one anoth , each of these warm event is be blame for specif problem .The Blob ha been associ , among other effect , with the unusu dri and warm weather in the western Unit State . Out in the ocean , the nutrient-poor warmer water of the Blob  about four degre Fahrenheit higher than averag  are disrupt the food web of marin life . Some speci of fish are show up where they are not expect , includ tropic sunfish off the Alaska coast , and an unusu number of emaci sea lion pup and Guadalup fur seal are be found strand on California shore .The warm water ha also been link to unpreced harm algal bloom along the coast that have render shellfish toxic and shut down shellfish fisheri in Washington , Oregon and California . A singl clam can have enough toxin to kill a person ,  said Vera L. Trainer , the manag of the marin biotoxin program at NOAA Northwest Fisheri Scienc Center in Seattl . Offici also order the largest closur of the state Dung crab fish .It realli worrisom ,  Dr. Trainer ad . If thi is a singl event that then goe away and we can forget about it down the road , it O.K . If it a window into the futur , it not a good future.The unusu strong El Nio weather pattern , in which the ocean surfac warm and releas immens amount of heat into the atmospher , ha drawn more attent  in part becaus it tend to bring heavi rain to Southern California , which is amid an intens drought , and cooler temperatur and rain across the southern Unit State dure the winter and potenti into the spring . ( The northern band of the countri tend to have somewhat warmer and drier condit . ) But El Nio effect are felt across the planet , and thi one ha been link to drought in Australia and enorm peat fire in Indonesia .The other larg forc at work , the Pacif decad oscil , is a long period  sometim , as the name impli , span decad  of rel cooler or warmer water . Sinc about the year 2000 , the oscil ha been in a cool state , which mani climat scientist say ha allow the ocean to soak up a great deal of the heat gener by greenhous gase as part of climat chang .Thi , in turn , may have kept global averag surfac temperatur from rise . Climat scientist have call that condit the warm hiatu , and those who deni the overwhelm scientif consensu on warm have use the hiatu to rais doubt about whether climat chang exist .Now , howev , the oscil appear to be enter a warm phase , said Gerald A. Meehl , a senior scientist at the Nation Center for Atmospher Research , and strong El Nio tend to nudg the cycl into a new phase . So the oscil and El Nio can all add togeth to give you a realli big shift toward warm over all .That go to provid a bigger boost to a global warm system ,  he said . These thing will add together. Alreadi , 2015 is on track to be the hottest year in the histor record .Climat chang could nudg all of the interact cycl of ocean heat and cold . Scientist are still tri to determin it effect on hurrican , though it is wide believ that becaus warm ocean water provid the energi for hurrican , the more power storm will grow even more potent over time .Whether there is a clear and detect human-caus compon to today cyclon activ is harder to prove , said Thoma R. Knutson , a research meteorologist with NOAA geophys fluid dynam laboratori at Princeton . We dont expect to necessarili be abl to detect these chang at thi time ,  he said .While no individu weather event can be link to climat chang , the continu warm alreadi appear to be increas the potenti strength of storm , said Kerri Emanuel , a hurrican expert at the Massachusett Institut of Technolog . Whether the storm reach their full potenti depend on other factor , he said . Statist , howev , there are too few storm to show that the stronger hurrican are be caus by climat chang yet .One phenomenon appear to be the result of a combin of El Nio , the Blob and climat chang . NOAA thi year announc that the world wa in the midst of onli the third global coral bleach event ever record . Sever bleach can lead to the death of reef , and the loss of habitat for marin life and shorelin protect from storm . The current event began in 2014 in the Pacif and ha persist into thi year , with the Blob effect be felt most keenli near Hawaii , where the western tail of that larg patch of warm water extend .Thi is absolut the worst that they have ever seen ,  said C. Mark Eakin , the coordin of NOAA Coral Reef Watch . It onli the third time theyv seen mass coral bleach in Hawaii ; the last time wa last year. And becaus El Nio event stretch from one year winter into the next spring , wer veri like to see the bleach that go on thi year go on into 2016 and even be wors in 2016 ,  he said .A warmer Pacif also mean higher sea at the Unit State coastlin , becaus warm water expand and the gener wind that flow from west to east will push water against the shore . That can add to an increas in what William Sweet , a NOAA oceanograph base in Maryland , call nuisanc flood in low-li coastal area .Even a gener increas of a half a foot from El Nio can , when combin with storm , caus a pronounc increas in such flood , he said , ad that San Francisco could go from an averag 12 day of nuisanc flood to 21 thi year , and La Jolla , Calif. , from six to 10 .Nichola A . Bond , a research meteorologist at NOAA cooper institut at the Univers of Washington who gave the Blob it name , said that climat chang could make El Nio condit more common . That would just have monstrou implic ,  he said . And though developed-world nation like the Unit State could take measur to adapt to the chang condit , It is go to be a differ place ,  he said .Despit all the current dark cloud over the Pacif , liter and metaphor , Dr . Bond manag to spot a silver line .The confluenc of problem can serv as a wake-up call ,  and a harbing of climat chang , he said . We have a real chanc with thi kind of event to see what go to happen , and show folk , Hey , thi is the consequ of mess around with the climate. ', 'Q . If our normal bodi temperatur is about 98.6 degre Fahrenheit , or 37 degre Celsiu , whi arent we most comfort when the temperatur around us is the same ?A . It should be note that the usual 98.6-degre normal read is for core bodi temperatur , not skin temperatur , which is usual consider lower , rise and fall with the ambient temperatur .It is at the skin surfac that much of the excess heat from the body metabol is discharg into the air , through radiat , conduct and convect and through evapor cool , which depend on sweat .

The goal hi doctor ( and doctor everywher ) were routin set for their patient had just been proven by a new studi to be far too stringent .All that broil fish , all those unbutt green bean , all that willpow , all for noth . Oop . ( Read an excerpt . )Thi kind of medic whiplash is increasingli common and everi bit as scari and damag as the physic kind . What wa good for you yesterday is useless or even bad for you today ( and may be good for you again tomorrow ; who know ) . Medic gospel is rewritten daili on the even news .The increment progress of ordinari scienc is one thing , as individu treatment are progress replac by better variant . We all happili accept that kind of revis . But medic revers , the authors sober term for sudden flip-flop in standard of care , unnerv and demor everyon , doctor no less than their patient .Dr. Vinayak K. Prasad and Dr. Adam S. Cifu , of Oregon Health & Scienc Univers and the Univers of Chicago , have set themselv the task of figur out how often modern medicin revers itself , analyz whi it happen , and suggest way to make it stop . If thi short list of object explod into a breathless and somewhat unwieldi critiqu of all of Western medicin , you still have to appreci both their ambit and their argument .An old saw ha long held that 50 percent of everyth a student learn in medic school is wrong . Actual calcul suggest that number is not too far off base  Dr. Prasad and Dr. Cifu extrapol from past revers to conclud that about 40 percent of what we consid state-of-the-art health care is like to turn out to be unhelp or actual harm .Recent offici flip-flop includ habit of treat everyth from lead poison to blood clot , from kidney stone to heart attack . One revers concern an extrem common orthoped procedur , the surgic repair of the meniscu in the knee , which turn out to be no more effect than physic therapi alon . The interest reader can plow through almost 150 disprov treatment in the book appendix .Some of the glitch that allow these flaw approach to enter and persist in medic practic will be familiar . Adequ scientif studi is often prohibit complic and expens , forc us to reli on less definit work . Financi interest tend to distort scientif result .More surpris , though , is an odd paradox : Often it is the treatment that make the most theoret sens that fail .The singl thing that all the abandon drug and treatment on the authors list have in common is that they are all reason , logic and scientif appeal . Everi one of them should work .The author write that we know enough about human physiolog  all the littl molecul scoot around in our bodi at the behest of those dictat , our gene  that we are now abl to come up with elabor , well-defend notion of how to help them all along . But the human bodi is so complic , and our understand of it so superfici , that what we believ should work often doe not.What could make more sens , after all , than find some cancer earli , fix a piec of torn cartilag , close a hole in the heart , and prop open blood vessel that have becom peril narrow ? And yet not one of these help intervent ha been shown to make a differ in the health or surviv of patient who obedi line up to have them done .As Dr. Prasad and Dr. Cifu point out , it all forc a care , critic look at the scientif paradigm that rule medicin these day .Basic scienc still lay the foundat for medic train in most school . Long befor student meet actual patient , they learn the minutia of the theori behind the practic . In fact , that part of their train is gener far more rigor and method than train in patient care , which can be remark slipshod .Often the studi of the studi of how therapi should work is much more extens and come befor the studi of whether therapi do work ,  the author write . Thu a medic cultur base on should work rather than doe work is condemn to constantli correct itself when the scienc is final evalu for outcom that matter .To fix thi constant backtrack would requir noth less than a revolut in how doctor are train , with an emphasi on the proven and practic rather than the theoret . ( It would also requir a second revolut in how doctor practic , with less prestig and remuner for come up with new idea and more for valid old one . )Until the revolut come , how can the averag patient avoid becom a victim of medic whiplash ? It not easi , particularli sinc common sens often wont help distinguish good treatment from bad .Dr. Prasad and Dr. Cifu offer a five-step plan , includ pointer for determin if a given treatment is realli abl to do what you want it to do , and advic on find a like-mind doctor who wont object to a certain amount of back-seat drive . Of cours , there are no guarante that their tip will endur forev , but they probabl have a longer shelf life than most medic advic .', 'High in the sky over Kazakhstan , space-ag technolog ha reveal an ancient mysteri on the ground .Satellit pictur of a remot and treeless northern stepp reveal coloss earthwork  geometr figur of squar , cross , line and ring the size of sever footbal field , recogniz onli from the air and the oldest estim at 8,000 year old .The largest , near a Neolith settlement , is a giant squar of 101 rais mound , it opposit corner connect by a diagon cross , cover more terrain than the Great Pyramid of Cheop .

There are pyramid all over the earth ,  he recal think . In Kazakhstan , there should be pyramid , too.Soon , he wa search Googl Earth imag of Kostanay and environ .There were no pyramid . But , he said , about 200 mile to the south he saw someth as intrigu  a giant squar , more than 900 feet on each side , made up of dot , crisscross by a dot X .At first Mr. Dey thought it might be a leftov Soviet instal , perhap one of Nikita S.

The line are go to the horizon . You cant figur out what the figur is.When they dug into one of the mound , they found noth . It wa not a cenotaph , where there are belong ,  he said . But nearbi they found artifact of a Neolith settlement 6,000 to 10,000 year old , includ spear point .Now , Mr. Dey said , the plan is to construct a base for operations.We can not dig up all the mound . That would be counterproduct ,  he said . We need modern technolog , like they have in the West.Dr. LaPort said he , Mr. Dey and their colleagu were also look into use drone , as the Cultur Ministri in Peru ha been do to map and protect ancient site .But time is an enemi , Mr. Dey said .

Pen , who is a doctor candid at the univers , and the first author of the studi . Anoth author , Baxter Sawvel , an undergradu at the time , wa help research how a snake bodi size affect the way it strike .They had record video of rat snake , which can grow from eight inch as babi to six feet when grown , offer a wide rang of size . Mr. Sawvel wa compar the speed of rat snake strike on video with known speed for viper , just to make sure the softwar wa work properli .The rat snake were just as fast as the known time for viper , which did not seem correct , given the prevail view of viper speed , Mr. Pen said .I said , Do it again.  Then he repeat the analysi himself . After go through 10 or 15 more video , he realiz there wa no mistak and set about design a new experi to do control test of snake strike .He and hi advis , Brad R. Moon , and Mr. Sawvel test 14 Texa rat snake , six western cottonmouth and 12 western diamondback rattlesnak . Cottonmouth and rattler are viper , and rat snake are not .The rat snake strike at their prey to catch it , but kill it by constrict , wrap their bodi around the rat or other anim , and squeez the life out of it .The research use a stuf glove on the end of an extend pole to provok defens strike . All of the snake were impress , but the viper were no better than the rat snake .Mr. Pen said it made sens in evolutionari term for nonvenom snake to strike just as quickli . All of them need to get the jump on prey .The snake strike they record took 48 to 84 millisecond . By comparison , the blink of an eye  a human eye  take about 200 millisecond . More import , it take mammal 60 to 395 millisecond to get their muscl move when they are startl .That mean that the snake often have the advantag on the rodent and other anim they eat  but not alway , which is what might be expect when both side are alway evolv .Mr. Pen said that the studi just scratch the surfac in term of how fast snake struck . The black mamba , for exampl , is suppos to be veri fast in move across the ground . How fast doe it strike ?Im not sure ,  he said . We have quantifi strike behavior from less than 1 percent of the snake .Id love to be abl to answer who the fastest ,  he ad .

The thing that realli got my attent ,  he said , i that they seem to mostli land on their feet.He brought them into hi laboratori and not onli figur out what they do , but produc some enchant slow-mot video of their movement in the air .Dr. Mittal is no stranger to the studi of aerodynam . He did work for the Armi on the way parachutist maneuv in free fall , use their arm and leg . The cricket do too , although with six leg and two antenna , he point out , they have more appendag at their dispos .Dr. Mittal ha three high-spe camera in hi lab and Emili Palmer , an undergradu at John Hopkin , and Nicola Deshler , a high school student at Washington Intern School , spent sever month get the cricket to jump . In all , they shot about two dozen good video .Dr. Mittal and hi colleagu are still do the mathemat analysi , to be present at a poster session at a Nov. 22-24 meet in Boston of the American Physic Society Divis of Fluid Dynam . But , he said , a few thing are fairli obviou .First , the cricket tri to becom as streamlin as possibl when they take off . But befor they hit the peak of their jump , they move their limb out from their bodi to stabil themselv at an angl of about 55 to 60 degre .And they keep that angl until their hind feet touch the ground . It like an aircraft land ,  Dr. Mittal said . Touch down nose first would be disastr .The result is that as soon as they land on their veri strong hind leg , theyr readi to jump again . Thi pattern hold true when they can jump straight forward , he said .If they are disturb from the side or from the front , they just take off and they dont realli care. Then , land can be a problem . Dr. Mittal hasnt seen realli bad crash , but in collect the cricket , he said it is common to find anim with damag limb , and bad land could be a caus .Ani new understand of movement and aerodynam in insect can be potenti use in design small robot .

Most year , you can see 15 to 20 meteor blaze across the sky everi hour , but thi time , we will like see onli one or two an hour , Dr. Cook said .Compar with other annual shower , the Lyrid put on a moder show .

As they voyag through the solar system , they spew speck of ice and rock .

It last trip wa in 1861 and it will make it next rendezv in 2276 . Accord to Dr. Cook , when we see a Lyrid shower , we are see debri that fell from the comet not dure it 1861 orbit , but from it previou one , around 1446 , or even an earlier one . Becaus the comet orbit doe not intersect Earth ,  he said , the debri must have time to drift away in order for us to run into it.Some of the spark we see dure a shower come from cosmic crumb no bigger than a pebbl . It not the size that determin how bright it will be , Dr. Cook said . Rather , it the speed at which it particl pierc the sky .

But now the speci may have gain a second chanc at surviv : Botanist in Britain have collect and germin seed from these wild birch for the first time in nearli 30 year .The new seedl may help restor genet divers to the small popul of cultiv tree and fuel effort to reintroduc them in the wild . Definit , it a great coup for a veri rare speci ,  said Michael Dosmann , a curat at the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard Univers , who wa not involv in the project .The mission to save B. chichibuensi is part of a broader undertak by British and Japanes scientist to survey and collect seed from all of Japan nativ plant , mani of which are found nowher els in the world .No one know whi B. chichibuensi grew so scarc . Expert now believ that there are more than two dozen in the wild ; in recent year , Toshihid Hirao , a forest ecologist at the Univers of Tokyo Chichibu Forest , ha discov eight other small stand in the mountain .

Eventu , they will be distribut to botan garden around Britain , and some may be return to Japan . The seedl may prove an enorm help in salvag the speci , and not just becaus of their number .B . chichibuensi ha never been grown systemat in arboretum , so the success of the U.K. team in germin seed of thi speci may be the first step toward conserv the gene pool ,  Dr. Hirao said .In 1987 , Hugh McAllist , then a botanist at the Univers of Liverpool Ness Botan Garden , receiv sever hundr B. chichibuensi seed from a colleagu in Japan .

Archaeologist express astonish at the rich of the find and it potenti for shed light on the emerg of the Mycenaean civil , the lost world of Agamemnon , Nestor , Odysseu and other hero describ in the epic of Homer .Probabl not sinc the 1950 have we found such a rich tomb ,  said Jame C. Wright , the director of the American School of Classic Studi at Athen . See the tomb wa a real highlight of my archaeolog career ,  said Thoma M. Brogan , the director of the Institut for Aegean Prehistori Studi Center for East Crete , note that you can count on one hand the number of tomb as wealthi as thi one.The warrior grave belong to a time and place that give it special signific . He wa buri around 1500 B.C. , next to the site on Pylo on which , mani year later , aros the palac of Nestor , a larg administr center that wa destroy in 1180 B.C. , about the same time as Homer Troy . The palac wa part of the Mycenaean civil ; from it ash , classic Greek cultur aros sever centuri later .The palac found at Mycen , Pylo and elsewher on the Greek mainland have a common inspir : All borrow heavili from the Minoan civil that aros on the larg island of Crete , southeast of Pylo . The Minoan were cultur domin to the Mycenaean but were later overrun by them .How , then , did Minoan cultur pass to the Mycenaean ? The warrior grave may hold mani answer . He die befor the palac began to be built , and hi grave is full of artifact made in Crete . Thi is a transform moment in the Bronz Age ,  Dr. Brogan said .The grave , in Dr. Wright view , lie at the date at the heart of the relationship of the mainland cultur to the higher cultur of Crete and will help scholar understand how the state cultur that develop in Crete were adopt into what becam the Mycenaean palac cultur on the mainland .Warrior probabl compet for statu as stratifi societi form on the mainland . Thi develop warrior societi like to show off it power through high-qual good , like Cretan seal stone and gold cup  lot of bling ,  as Dr. Wright put it . Perhap we can theoriz that thi site wa that of a rise chiefdom ,  he said .The grave wa discov thi spring , on May 18 , by Jack L. Davi and Sharon R. Stocker , a husband-and-wif team at the Univers of Cincinnati who have been excav at Pylo for 25 year .The top of the warrior shaft grave lie at ground level , seemingli so easi to find that it is quit surpris the tomb lay intact for 35 centuri .It is inde mind boggl that we were first ,  Dr. Davi wrote in an email . Im still shake my head in disbelief . So mani walk over it so mani time , includ our own team.The palac at Pylo wa first excav by Carl Blegen , also of the Univers of Cincinnati , who on hi first day of dig in 1939 discov a larg cach of tablet written in the script known as Linear B , later deciph as the earliest written form of Greek .Whether or not Blegen luck wa on their mind , Dr. Davi and Dr. Stocker start thi season to excav outsid the palac in hope of hit the dwell that may have surround it and learn how ordinari citizen live . On their first day of dig , they struck two wall at right angl . First they assum the structur wa a hous , then a room , and final a grave .I wa veri pessimist about thi ,  Dr. Davi said , think that the grave wa probabl some mediev construct , or that even if it wa prehistor it would almost certainli have been rob . But a few day later , he receiv a text messag from the supervis archaeologist say , I hit bronze.What he and Dr. Stocker had stumbl on wa a veri rare shaft grave , 5 feet deep , 4 feet wide and 8 long . Remark , the burial wa intact apart from a one-ton stone , probabl onc the lid of the grave , which had fallen in and crush the wooden coffin beneath .The coffin ha long sinc decay , but still remain are the bone of a man about 30 to 35 year old and lie on hi back . Place to hi left were weapon , includ a long bronz sword with an ivori hilt clad in gold and a gold-hilt dagger . On hi right side were four gold ring with fine Minoan carv and some 50 Minoan seal stone carv with imageri of goddess and bull jumper . I wa just stun by the qualiti of the carv ,  Dr. Wright said , note that the object must have come out of the best workshop of the palac of Crete.An ivori plaqu carv with a griffin , a mythic anim that protect goddess and king , lay between the warrior leg . The grave contain gold , silver and bronz cup .The warrior seem to have been someth of a dandi . Among the object accompani him to the netherworld were a bronz mirror with an ivori handl and six ivori comb .Becaus of the griffin depict in the grave , Dr. Davi and Dr. Stocker refer to the man inform as the griffin warrior. He wa certainli a promin leader in hi commun , they say , mayb the pre-emin one . The palac at Pylo had a king or wanax ,  a titl mention in the Linear B tablet , but it not known if thi posit exist in the griffin warrior societi .Ancient Greek grave can be date by their potteri , but the griffin warrior grave had none : Hi vessel are made of silver or gold , not humbl clay . From shard found abov and below the grave , howev , Dr. Davi believ it wa dug in the period known as Late Hellad II , a pottery-rel chronolog that correspond to 1600 B.C . to 1400 B.C. , in the view of some author , or 1550 B.C . to 1420 B.C. , in the view of other .If the earliest European civil is that of Crete , the first on the European mainland is the Mycenaean cultur to which the griffin warrior belong . It is not entir clear whi civil began on Crete , but the island popul size and favor posit for sea trade between Egypt and Greec may have been factor . Crete is ideal situat between mainland Greec and the east , and it had enough of a popul to resist raid ,  said Malcolm H. Wiener , an invest manag and expert on Aegean prehistori .The Minoan cultur on Crete exert a strong influenc on the peopl of southern Greec . Copi and adapt Minoan technolog , they develop the palac cultur such as those of Pylo and Mycen . But as the Mycenaean grew in strength and confid , they were eventu abl to invad the land of their tutor . Notabl , they then adapt Linear A , the script in which the Cretan wrote their own languag , into Linear B , a script for write Greek .Linear B tablet were preserv in the fieri destruct of palac when the soft clay on which they were written wa bake into perman form . Cach of tablet have been found in Knosso , the main palac of Crete , and in Pylo and other mainland palac . Linear B , a script in which each symbol stand for a syllabl , wa later succeed by the familiar Greek alphabet in which each symbol repres a singl vowel or conson .The griffin warrior , whose grave object are cultur Minoan but whose place of burial is Mycenaean , lie at the center of thi cultur transfer . The palac of Pylo had yet to aris , and he could have been part of the cultur transit that made it possibl . The transfer wa not entir peac : At some point , the Mycenaean invad Crete , and in 1450 B.C. , the palac of Knosso wa burn , perhap by Mycenaean . It is not yet clear whether the object in the griffin warrior tomb were signific in hi own cultur or just plunder .I think these object were not just loot but had a mean alreadi for the guy buri in thi grave ,  Dr. Davi said . Thi is the critic period when religi idea were be transfer from Crete to the mainland.The Mycenaean use the Minoan sacr symbol of bull horn on their build and fresco , and their religi practic seem to have been a mix of Minoan concept with those of mainland Greec .Archaeologist are look forward to studi a major unloot tomb with modern techniqu like DNA analysi , which may shed light on the warrior origin . DNA , if extract from the warrior teeth , may tell where in Greec he wa born . Suitabl plant materi , if found in the tomb , could yield a radiocarbon date for the burial .Thi and other techniqu allow far more inform to be extract from a rich grave site than wa possibl with the pick and shovel use by earlier excav . Wev come a long way from Heinrich Schliemann ,  said Mr. Wiener , refer to the effort of the 19th-centuri German businessman who excav Troy and Mycen to support hi view that the event describ by Homer were base on histor fact .', 'With twin boy readi for school , Jason and Jessica Pollard brace for paperwork , parent-teach meet and shop trip for suppli .

A combin home phone and tablet system that transform how older senior connect with and are care for by their love ones.Daili , too , I hear tale of technolog fail in variou way to do what older peopl or their worri famili expect . I hear about frail elder who remov their emerg pendant at bedtim , then fall in the dark when they walk to the bathroom and cant summon help .About a 90-year-old in Sacramento who store hi never-worn emerg pendant in hi refriger . About a Cambridg , Mass. , daughter who ha tri four or five telephon  not cellphon or smartphon , but ordinari landlin  in an ongo effort to find one simpl enough for her 95-year-old mother to reliabl dial her number and have a convers .Which scenario repres the likeli futur for senior-ori technolog ? It depend on whom you ask .Entrepreneur are hard at work develop platform , app , site and devic meant to help older adult manag their health , live independ and maintain famili and social connect , all laudabl goal . Let call their effort silvertech .Until a few year ago , the whole tech world wasnt suffici focus on thi enorm opportun ,  said Stephen Johnston , a co-found of Aging2.0 , which connect technolog compani with the senior care industri . It chang quit rapidly. He estim that 1,500 silvertech start-up had arisen global in the past three year .A coupl of recent develop have intensifi American entrepreneuri interest , said Lauri Orlov , a busi analyst who began the Age in Place Technolog Watch blog in 2008 .Last spring , a start-up call Honor , which match older adult with vet home care worker , rais $ 20 million in ventur capit from promin Silicon Valley investor . That gave all kind of organ hope for market potenti ,  Ms. Orlov said .In addit , Medicar ha begun to broaden the kind of remot health monitor  a.k.a . telehealth  that it will cover , though so far onli in rural area or in a pilot program for account care organ . Eventu , remot monitor will be the way peopl will stay out of emerg room and nurs home ,  Ms. Orlov predict .Yet Mr. Johnston , whose organ conven pitch event for silvertech develop , acknowledg that there have definit been a few misstep , and there havent been too mani huge win yet.As a geriatrician at the Univers of California , San Francisco , Dr. Ken Covinski often hear from Silicon Valley tinker with big idea . He ha becom someth of a skeptic , as he point out in a post for the GeriP blog last month .It incred well mean ,  he said in an interview . But there are assumpt that are at odd with the problem our patient and famili are facing.Tech peopl seem enamor , for exampl , with the prospect of continu monitor older peopl use sensor that transmit inform on when they get up , leav the hous and open the refriger ( or dont ) .Asid from the question of whether older adult appreci such scrutini , Dr. Covinski suspect that an hour or two a day from a skill home care worker ( one paid more than minimum wage , he ad ) would do them more good .They dont necessarili need someon to know when they open the fridg ,  he said . They need someon to make or deliv a good meal.Remot medic monitor  of blood pressur or blood glucos , say  present potenti problem , too . The data will have transient blip , and sometim act on them lead to overtreat that doe more harm than good ,  Dr. Covinski said .Both he and Dr. Lesli Kernisan , a geriatrician in San Francisco who began publish her Geritech blog three year ago , groan when a compani call Pixi Scientif propos embed monitor in adult incontin brief to measur urin pH and other sign of urinari tract infect .A disast ,  Dr. Kernisan said . While mani older peopl are colonized with bacteria that will show up in urinalys , they arent sick and dont need treatment . It would just lead to antibiot overuse.Develop , she said , arent take advantag of geriatricians expertis . She ha recommend some silvertech product for patient , with mix result .A SafeinHom monitor system did notifi distant famili member that a 92-year-old had fallen and broken her hip . Becaus the system had malfunct befor , howev , it took rel hour to recogn that thi time the crisi wa real . Still , help arriv sooner rather than later . ( Of cours , the woman still suffer a broken hip . )Dr. Kernisan use read from a Blipcar wireless blood-pressur cuff to help care for a 76-year-old patient , with dementia , who live in a senior facil . It work well , but it wa a huge pain to set up ,  Dr. Kernisan said .She even had to argu to gain access to the facility Wi-Fi network . How mani physician are will to do that ?Design will play a crucial role in how use consum find ani of these product , but it present tricki question . Do you come up with someth special for older adult ? You dont want to be hand smartphon with shini glass to peopl with Parkinson diseas or hand tremor or macular degener , and say , Have a nice day ,   Ms. Orlov caution .Yet with some except  the Jitterbug phone , for instanc  product aim pure at older adult have often falter . Sometim theyr too complex , or too difficult for those with dementia , which is a lot of peopl .Or user may balk becaus the devic becom an uncomfort constant remind of incapac . Technolog isnt alway the solut to a problem .Our job is to make our patients health problem as littl a part of their live as possibl ,  Dr. Covinski said . Mi fear is that if you make peopl consciou of fall all the time , theyll just stop walking.Happili , develop are begin to involv their potenti custom . A lot of start-up tri to chang the world are run by 25-year-old who dont know much about be 85 or be a caregiv ,  Mr. Johnston said .So Aging2.0 ha invit older adult to serv on consum panel to evalu idea , and ha brought entrepreneur and pitch event into senior live facil . We get realli interest insight ,  Mr. Johnston said .For exampl , the founder of TrueLink , a prepaid debit card design for older adult , learn through convers with them that when problem aris , they dont want to be funnel to a websit or an app ; they want to dial a number and get quick , clear answer . TrueLink respond with predict analytics so that it phone system could quickli rout caller to the right person .Dure thi interim period  with raft of supposedli transform gizmo , most doom like mani new product to fail  I suspect older peopl and their caregiv will continu to find it difficult to distinguish use technolog from that which simpli produc frustrat .What we need is a Consum Report for silvertech . Until one emerg , Consum Report itself ha look at alert system . And the Unit Hospit Fund ha just publish A Famili Caregiver Guid to Electron Organ , Monitor , Sensor , and App ,  an onlin handbook that includ question to consid befor buy electron product and servic .There probabl no substitut for discuss purchas with the intend user . It doesnt matter how well design an emerg respons devic is if someon stash it in hi refriger . Yet even if someon live alon doe not exactli welcom a sensor system , she may find it an accept altern to leav her longtim home .Dr. Kernisan offer a bit of advic base on experi : Choos someth with a risk-fre trial , so you can get your money back.', 'Moviego and electron game player have grown accustom to digit manipul of all sort of still and move imag .But even the most jade among them might be surpris by a process that comput scientist in California and Germani have develop to instantan transfer facial express .With the new techniqu , one person smile appear seamlessli on live video of anoth person face , even though the second person is not smile at all .A comput process the transfer in 30 millisecond , no time at all for a human observ , although less expens camera can result in a bit of a lag .The research demonstr their techniqu with simultan live video from two peopl , and the result is at least mildli disturb .

The long-term shortag of worker that follow help bring about the end of feudal .Historian and microbiologist alik have search for decad for the origin of plagu . Until now , the first clear evid of Yersinia pesti infect wa the Plagu of Justinian in the 6th centuri , which sever weaken the Byzantin Empir .But in a new studi , publish on Thursday in the journal Cell , research report that the bacterium wa infect peopl as long as 5,000 year ago .Exactli what those earli outbreak were like is imposs to know . But the author of the new studi suggest that plagu epidem in the Bronz Age may have open the door to wave of migrant in region decim by diseas .To my mind , thi leav littl doubt that thi ha play a major role in those popul replac ,  said Esk Willerslev , a co-author of the new studi and the director of the Center for GeoGenet at the Univers of Copenhagen .David M. Wagner , a microbi geneticist at Northern Arizona Univers who wa not involv in the studi , said that the new research should prompt other scientist to look at mysteri outbreak in earli histori , such as the epidem that devast Athen dure the Peloponnesian War . It open up whole new area of research ,  he said .The new studi aros from previou research by Dr. Willerslev and hi colleagu . They were abl to extract human DNA from101 bone found in Europ and Asia , rang in age from about 3,000 to 5,000 year old .As they report in June , the genet profil of peopl dure that 2,000-year period chang with surpris abrupt . About 4,500 year ago , for exampl , the DNA of Europe inhabit suddenli took on a strong resembl to that of the Yamnaya , a nomad peopl from western Russia .Wonder what could have trigger such a shift , Dr. Willerslev and hi colleagu realiz they could test one hypothesi : that epidem had decim some popul , allow new group to establish themselv .When research search for ancient human genet materi in a piec of bone , they begin by retriev all the DNA in the sampl . Most of it is not human , belong instead to bacteria and other microb that colon bone after death .Onc scientist have gather all the DNA , they assembl the genet fragment into larger piec and tri to match them to sequenc alreadi identifi in earlier research . Normal they set asid microbi DNA to focu on the human materi .Dr. Willerslev and hi colleagu wonder if some of the nonhuman DNA they had collect from Bronz Age remain might belong to pathogen . They decid to look for trace of Yersinia pesti , even though the earliest evid of the infect date to thousand of year later .Plagu wa just a long shot ,  said Dr. Willerslev .But sometim long shot pay off . Of 101 Bronz Age individu , the research found Yersinia pesti DNA in seven . Plagu DNA wa present in teeth recov from site stretch from Poland to Siberia .By compar the ancient Yersinia to more recent strain , the scientist also were abl to reconstruct it evolutionari histori .Plagu can take sever differ form . In bubon plagu , the most common , the bacteria invad the lymphat system . Left untreat , it can kill a victim within day .The infect is spread by flea hop between rat and human . But 5,000 year ago , Dr. Willerslev and hi colleagu found , Yersinia pesti didnt yet have a gene known to be essenti for surviv in flea .The bacterium did have mani of the gene that make it deadli to human . Dr. Wagner suggest that peopl may have becom infect with plagu in ancient time not by flea , but bybreath in the microb or by hunt infect rodent for food .After acquir the abil to infect flea , Yersinia pesti may have begun to spread more readili from one rodent to anoth , eventu caus widespread epidem . It realli say someth about the rapid evolut of pathogen ,  said Dr. Wagner .Hendrik N. Poinar , a geneticist at McMaster Univers who wa not involv in the studi , found thi evolutionari scenario persuas  a slam dunk ,  he said . But he isnt convinc that huge outbreak of primit plagu rock ancient societi and question whether the bacteria could have spread quickli without infect flea .It is specul as to whether these strain were respons for high mortal rate in the Bronz Age ,  he said .Dr. Willerslev and hi colleagu are now look for more clue to how the plagu affect the Bronz Age world  as well as other pathogen that may have left behind genet trace . He is now grate that he and hi colleagu didnt simpli throw out all their nonhuman DNA .It wa just annoy wast lie there that we had to bulli our way through ,  said Dr. Willerslev .

Hi son had urg him to run , but in the month follow hi death , Mr. Biden openli acknowledg hi own fragil : sudden breakdown , drain emot reserv .Thi is not the first time the nation polit life ha been roil by excruci grief of a parent who ha lost a child . In 1900 , as mani as three in 10 infant in urban area die befor their first birthday . No surpris , then , that mani 18th- and 19th-centuri presid suffer the loss of one or more children . Historian are still talli the cost to both our leader and the public .Four of the six children Thoma Jefferson father with hi wife , Martha , includ their onli son , die befor they were 4 year old . William Henri Harrison endur the earli death of six of hi ten children , includ three adult son in the three year lead up to hi elect in 1840 .In Januari 1853 , two month befor hi inaugur , Franklin Pierc lost hi third and onli surviv son , Benni , in a train accid . Pierc himself had to pick up the 11-year-old boy right after hi head wa smash to jelli ,  as a New York Time correspond report .A week later , Pierc wrote former Senat Jefferson Davi , who would serv as hi Secretari of War . How shall I be abl to summon my manhood to gather up my energi for the duti befor me , it is hard for me to see.

For decad , the literatur on grief wa anchor mostli by the conceptu model devis by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross : a progress through denial , anger , bargain and depress befor reach accept .Robert Neimey , a psychologist at the Univers of Memphi and editor of the journal Death Studi , call the Kubler-Ross model rusti and dusti ,  argu that it is use in it gener , but fail in it particulars.Recoveri is rare so neat and predict , Dr. Neimey said . Some bereav parent rebound veri slowli , if at all . Research suggest that about 30 percent will suffer from persist , complex bereav . They struggl with daili function for six month or longer after the loss becaus of intrus thought on the deceas . Parent like Franklin Pierc who wit the violent death of a child are like to fare worst of all .Complex bereav is complic and can also give rise to other psychiatr and somat condit , such as major depress and hypertens ,  said Theres Rando , a psychotherapist who ha written sever book on grief .On the posit side , studi also show that mani bereav parent experi what some expert call post-traumat growth . Richard Tedeschi and Lawrenc Calhoun , psychologist at the Univers of North Carolina at Charlott , note that posit chang often emerg after a crisi , such as a greater appreci of life and a greater sens of person strength .But the growth doesnt necessarili lead to a decreas in the distress  the long or the grief ,  Dr. Calhoun note .

The research found that the most complic voice-activ system can take a motorist mind off the road for as long as 27 second after he or she stop interact with the system . Even less complex system can leav the driver distract for 15 second after a motorist disengag , the research show .These problem occur too with voice-activ system from Appl , Googl and Microsoft , accord to the studi .Thi linger distract reflect the time requir for driver to reorient themselv to the road after interact with their cars voice-activ technolog , accord to the study lead scientist , David Strayer , a neuroscientist at the Univers of Utah .

The safeti advoc say that carmak have a financi incent to push these system becaus they can be sold as profit add-on to new car .In the latest research from Dr. Strayer , one of the field most establish scientist , he compar the mental energi requir by driver to use more than 10 differ voice-activ system .

In the Unit State , more than 70 percent of all antibiot go to anim .That breed resist strain of bacteria that enter the food suppli and the wider environ and can share their antibiotic-outwit gene even with bug that do not origin in anim , scientist say . While mani nation have sought to rein in antibiot overus in human , administr of the drug to livestock is larg unregul , and is increas along with global demand for meat , egg and dairi .Global , livestock consum 63,000 ton of antibiot in 2010 , and their use is expect to grow by two-third by 2030 , said Dr. Juan Lubroth , chief of anim health at the Unit Nations Food and Agricultur Organ .Thi is the biggest singl use of antibiot and it uncontrol ,  said Ellen Silbergeld , a professor of environment health scienc at the John Hopkin Bloomberg School of Public Health . I wa born at the dawn of the antibiot era , and probabl befor I die the antibiot era will be over.The spread of multidrug-resist superbugs would make now-minor infect life-threaten and drive death and diseas to level not seen sinc the 19th centuri , scientist say . It would increas the rate of neonat death among infant , it would make transplant and other kind of surgeri highli hazardous and push up rate of matern death in childbirth , Ms. Silbergeld said .Wer talk about the 1880 . Thi is not a clock we realli want to wind backward ,  she said . Wer destroy most of our drugs.If resist continu to rise , 10 million addit peopl could die annual by 2050 , more than are now kill each year by cancer , accord to a Decemb report from a commiss appoint by Prime Minist David Cameron of Britain to investig the problem global . The cumul loss in econom output would reach $ 60 trillion to $ 100 trillion in 35 year , the report said .Mr. Cameron warn last year that inact could lead to an almost unthink scenario where antibiot no longer work and we are cast back into the dark age of medicine.Salli Davi , England chief medic offic , ha call drug resist a tick time bomb that rank alongsid terror and climat chang as critic threat .Agricultur is drive about half of the resist increas global , and could be respons for as much as 80 percent of the problem in the Unit State , where the large-scal , intens approach to food product origin , said Jim ONeil , a former chief economist at Goldman Sach and the chair of the British commiss .Mr. ONeil said he hope to see a Unit Nation agreement on tackl antibiot resist within a year , and ha urg the Group of 20 2016 host , China , to put the issu on the summit meeting agenda .The farm and veterinari pharmaceut industri say they use and make antibiot respons , and that agriculture role in creat resist is exagger .Dr. Richard Carneval , vice presid for regulatori , scientif and intern affair at the Anim Health Institut , an associ of anim drug compani , said antibiot use in anim made onli a small contribut to the wider resist problem .In the whole scheme of thing , it a rel minor impact from what we can see , and I think that the situat get a littl blown out of proport ,  he said . Unfortun , agricultur get lump in and blame with a lot of the problem in human that realli have noth to do with animals.Trudi Wastweet , director of congression relat at the American Farm Bureau Feder , said farmer and the food product compani they contract with use prevent antibiot onli for specif , discret period , for exampl on piglet whose immun system are vulner when they are be wean .There a frustrat in agricultur that the use of these product is not understood ,  Ms. Wastweet said . Judici use of those drug on the farm , that is the norm , that is a standard of care our American livestock produc use.Critic say antibiot use on Unit State farm is routin , lead to resist strain of bacteria like E.coli and salmonella that taint meat and are releas into air and water via the vast amount of manur produc .When Consum Report magazin bought ground beef at store around the Unit State , it said in an August articl , test show that 18 percent of the convent rais sampl were taint with bacteria resist to three or more class of antibiot . Industri execut call the stori mislead .Even more worri , expert say , is the spread of intens livestock product to develop countri , where huge farm are now common and the presenc of counterfeit and poor-qual drug creat resist even more quickli . Industrial-scal agricultur is like to becom even more widespread as poorer countries economi grow and their expand middl class demand the meat , egg and dairi product commonli consum in the develop world .The emerg of the highli drug-resist New Delhi E.coli superbug , first identifi in 2009 , wa a frighten tast of what the futur may hold , and it travel quickli around the world .Bacteria dont know ani border ,  said Ms. Silbergeld . And of cours food doesnt know too mani border , either.China , which produc half the world pig , ha focus on rein in overus of antibiot in human but ha yet to confront anim use , Mr. ONeil said . Nor ha India , a hotb of antibiot misus and drug-resist bug , he said .Brazil , a major chicken export , is anoth big user , said Dr. Lubroth , of the Food and Agricultur Organ . He also point to Southeast Asia , where antibiot are use in fish farm , risk the releas of superbug into lake and river , as well as on the seafood the region export .Europ ha done the most to restrict antibiot in agricultur , though it rule are a patchwork . Denmark , a big pork produc , outlaw antibiot use on anim for all but diseas treatment .Most contenti is the use of low level of antibiot in healthi anim to encourag them to grow faster .They can fatten up the anim and get more from them at less cost ,  Mr. ONeil said . And so until recent it been a rough argument with consumers to restrict the drug and risk rais food price .In the Unit State , the Food and Drug Administr ha ask veterinari pharmaceut compani to voluntarili remov growth promot from drug label as an accept use for those antibiot that are also import in human medicin . It also urg that the administr of such drug be supervis by a veterinarian . Health expert have critic those guidelin , part of a broader Obama administr strategi on drug resist , as too lax . Last year , an F.D.A . report said agricultur use of medic import antibiot had increas 16 percent from 2009 to 2012 .Dr. Bernard Vallat , director gener of the World Organ for Anim Health , an intergovernment bodi , said half it 180 member nation deem growth promot an accept use , though he said the Unit State shift could prompt chang .Consum pressur , too , may drive a reduct in antibiot use . In March , McDonald said chicken serv in it Unit State restaur would be free of antibiot use in human within two year . Other have made similar pledg . Perdu say half it chicken are now rais without antibiot .Dr. Vallat said veterinari oversight of antibiot wa key , call , too , for better train of veterinarian in develop countri . Dr. Lubroth said improv hygien would reduc the need for antibiot , as could the develop of new anim vaccin .It is not enough just to critic develop countri without chang practic in the West too , he emphas : We can point finger , but we should also hold up mirrors.', 'LONDON  From coffe to cocoa , and almond to blueberri , some of the world most nutrit and econom vital food crop are vulner to declin caus by catastroph die-off of the bee whose pollin is key to their life cycl .A multitud of factor , most of them link to the practic of intens , industrial-scal agricultur , have been drive down popul of both wild speci and commerci bred honeybe around the world .American beekeep lost more than 40 percent of their honeybe coloni last year , the White Hous say .

With per-acr product fail to keep up with rise demand for food , the amount of land devot to grow pollinator-depend crop is expand , reduc uncultiv space avail for the varieti of wild plant and flower that bee need to thrive , Mr. Garibaldi said .Pollin deficit is a realiti for mani crop ,  he said .The bulk of the world calor need are fill by wind-pollin or self-pollin crop like wheat , corn and rice , which do not depend on bee . About a third of global food crop reli on pollin , mostli bee but occasion butterfli , bird or bat , said Clair Kremen , faculti co-director of the Berkeley Food Institut at the Univers of California , cite a 2007 studi she co-author .What is more , pollinator-depend food provid a disproportion share of import vitamin and miner , expert say . They includ fruit , veget , bean and nut , everyth from appl , citru and tomato to grape , cucumb and broccoli .Bee are econom vital , too . Bee-depend crop like coffe and cocoa make up a big chunk of the gross domest product in mani develop countri , so product loss would have an outsiz impact on livelihood , Mr. Garibaldi said .Honeybe increas crop valu by $ 15 billion a year in the Unit State , accord to a White Hous task forc on protect pollinators health . Wild bee speci add about $ 3,250 in product per cultiv hectar , Mr. Kleijn said .A number of factor appear to be drive the bee death . Attent ha focus on a class of pesticid call neonicotinoid . The European Union ban the use of three such chemic in 2013 , despit pesticid companies argument that the scienc wa inconclus . Britain suspend the ban thi year to allow limit neonicotinoid use after the Nation Farmers Union said the pesticid were need to fight off the cabbag stem flea beetl .Pesticid are certainli part of bees troubl , say expert , but the problem is far broader , and point to the bigger environment impact of the vast , highli intens farm that are common in North America and Western Europ , and which are now be pursu in China and other develop nation .Enorm field devot to just one crop leav bee with a diet that lack varieti , and is avail onli dure the short window when that plant is in bloom . Effici modern practic mean the patch of weed and wildflow that onc provid feed ground for bee in and around farm are no longer avail .Im sit right now look at a soybean field , it probabl 60 to 90 or 100 acr and there not a singl weed in thi whole field , there noth els grow but soybean ,  Mr. Tucker said . Thi is all desert land as far as the bee go.Global movement of good , plant and anim expos insect to alien virus , fungi , mite and other pathogen , at a time when their immun is suppress by poor nutrit . On top of that come exposur to power pesticid and fungicid , often coat onto seed befor farmer even buy them .All thi stress on the bee , all these diseas ,  said Riccardo Jannoni , secretari gener of Apimondia , the Intern Feder of Beekeepers Associ , in Rome . The bee are struggl in mani ways.Everi winter , beekeep across the Unit State ship their hive to California Central Valley , where wooden box full of bee are stack amid row of almond tree . The region produc 80 percent of the world almond , and could not do so without the trucked-in bee .Wer get close to crunch time , becaus right now we are estim that 90 percent of the avail bee for pollin are in use , so there not much of a buffer ,  Mr. Tucker said .Ms. Kremen , the Berkeley professor , said such single-crop situat are increasingli common . There thi enorm demand for pollin servic all at one time , and usual it like a week or two week when those field have to have the pollin or theyr not go to get the fruit or the nut , so theyr veri , veri vulner ,  she said .Thi is whi our system is becom much more precari , much more brittl , much more riski ,  she said . It put all your egg in one basket . Wer put all our egg in have these honeybe that can be truck around.A system that favor smaller-scal produc use fewer chemic , encourag natur predat to manag pest and grow a varieti of crop would help bee popul and eas the other environment impact of industrial-scal farm too , Ms. Kremen said .Smaller step can also help , expert say . The White Hous pollin protect strategi , releas in May , set a goal of creat or improv bee and butterfli habitat on seven million acr , by plant on feder land and encourag state , local and busi to do the same .It also said feder agenc would explor way to improv plant divers along the Interst 35 corridor , which run 1,500 mile from Texa to Minnesota , along the migratori path of monarch butterfli .Ani expans of semiwild land help bee by provid feed ground rich with flower and weed .We just dont see them along the roadsid anymor becaus they mow them or they spray them ,  Mr. Tucker said . Theyr even spray the ditch for invas weeds.Ultim , onli broader chang in the way agricultur is practic will save bee and other suffer speci , he said .What we are do now is not sustain ,  he said . It not go to keep us aliv on thi planet in a world that wed like to live in and experi . Our kids kid are just not go to see the divers of life that we have , and it unfortun becaus there are other alternatives.', 'On a sunni morn in Octob 2014 , Christoph Schmidt stroll onto the grassi field of Magazin Beach , a public park along the Charl River in Cambridg , Mass . To get a better view of the fall sceneri , he launch hi drone , a DJI Phantom quadcopt equip with a camera .Then he saw it : a juvenil red-tail hawk circl nearbi . Within second , it swoop down  wing outstretch , tail flare , talon open  and flip the drone midair . Mr. Schmidt cut the propel , and the bird flew off , appar uninjur . The drone drop to the ground , undamag except for a slight bend in it plastic land gear .Mr. Schmidt , a 31-year-old softwar develop , post a drone eye video of the encount on YouTub . It ha been view about five million time . And it is hardli the onli evid of conflict between anim and so-cal unman aerial vehicl .In other video , osprey , magpi , sea gull and gees pursu and attack drone in flight . With a hop and punch , a kangaroo knock one to the ground . A cheetah chase , leap and swipe at one . A pugnaci ram head-butt a drone that hover too low . And a particularli defiant chimpanze at a zoo in the Netherland whack a buzz intrud out of the sky with a branch .As drone becom smaller , cheaper and easier to oper , anim increasingli must contend with airborn paparazzi . At a recent confer , Rich Swayz of the Feder Aviat Administr estim that one million drone will be sold in the Unit State thi Christma . Yet the agenc ha still not releas offici regul for commerci use of drone . As for recreat user , it strongli encourag them to follow it basic safeti guidelin , which hardli mention anim .Recreat drone user have driven loung seal and their pup into the ocean and frighten otter into dive at Morro Bay , said Scott Kathey , the feder regulatori coordin of the Monterey Bay Nation Marin Sanctuari in California . In June last year , the Nation Park Servic prohibit the use of unman aerial vehicl in it park , in part becaus drone had disturb bighorn sheep and other anim .Such interact have alarm wildlif biologist  even as more of them are turn to drone to studi anim . The devic can be safer , more nimbl , less expens and often less disrupt than , say , a helicopt , jeep or boat . The last thing a scientist want to do is alter the animal natur behavior ,  Mr. Kathey said . They just want to be a fli on the wall.Sometim it work , sometim not . Drone have help scientist unobtrus survey penguin , leopard seal , sandhil crane and dugong . In Patagonia , scientist are fli drone through the 12-foot-tal exhal of whale , scoop up their mucu in order to monitor their health . And the Kenya Wildlif Servic ha found that surveil drone may reduc poach of eleph and rhino .But the small size and agil of drone  and their mosquito-lik invas  can be uniqu irksom , even danger , to wildlif . Scientist have onli just begun to examin the risk and benefit in detail , but alreadi it is clear that much depend on the speci and how the drone are deploy .Last year David Grmillet , an ecologist at the Nation Center for Scientif Research in Franc , and a team of colleagu repeatedli flew Phantom quadcopt near wild mallard loaf on a pond in the Zoo du Lunaret in Montpelli . Later , the team aim the drone toward flamingo and common greenshank wade in a brackish lagoon near the Rhone river delta .The research vari the speed and incom angl of the drone dure 204 approach flight , watch the bird through binocular . Eighti percent of the time , the scientist got a drone within four meter , or about 13 feet , of the bird without ani observ reaction .Nearli everi time a drone descend vertic , howev , the bird move away or took flight , probabl becaus that angl evok the approach of a raptor .We clearli see a potenti for research , but onli if you assess the risk to wildlif first ,  Dr. Grmillet said . Each speci will have it own reaction. Territori bird such as hawk , crow and sea gull are like to assault drone , he note . But the devic could be perfect for surreptiti observ waterfowl from 150 feet or higher .Nevertheless , Dr. Grmillet and hi co-author caution in their studi that even when anim show no overt reaction to drone , thi doe not mean that the drone presenc wa not stress for the animals. To be certain , one would have to measur a creature intern physiolog .Recent a team of American scientist set out to do exactli that . They program autonom quadcopt to fli in circl over four adult black bear and sever cub in forest , shrub land and farm in northwest Minnesota . In an earlier studi , the adult bear had been outfit with GP collar and small heart rate monitor .Judg by appear alon , the bear did not seem particularli disturb . They rare made an attempt to evad the drone , although one did stop in place and stare skyward .Dure everi drone flight , howev , the bears heart rate increas markedli abov baselin , by as much as 123 beat per minut , or 400 percent , in one instanc . The buzz drone were appar alarm enough to rous anoth bear from hibern .These bear are use to human sound and sight like farm equip and roadway , and I had no idea how they were go to respond ,  said Mark Ditmer , a biologist at the Univers of Minnesota , who led the studi . But some of the heart rate read were rather shock . I dont know if we have ever measur such a dramat chang other than when an anim ha been shot by a hunter.Bear , deer , coyot and other speci live on the border of civil have learn to toler and take advantag of human technolog , pri open trash can and leap fenc to get a meal . Drone , howev , are not just anoth stationari compon of human societi . They are design to be our avatar and go where we can not . Scientist arent sure how easi it will be for anim to adapt .There are so mani video on the Internet where you can see drone collid with bird ,  Dr. Grmillet said . Some peopl find it funni . I dont . My opinion is that if everyon start to use drone , it will be a huge mess.David Bird , an emeritu professor of wildlif biolog at McGill Univers , ha use drone to survey gees , tern and nest bird of prey . Some of the raptor he studi aggress defend their nest from ani intrud . Dr. Bird wa onc in a helicopt attack by an osprey .On the whole , he ha found that drone make control scientif survey safer , faster and less stress for both peopl and anim . But he is still concern about the Wild West show of recreat drone use .Some of those propel blade can do seriou damag ,  he said . Even a respons hobbyist might not be awar of all the risks.', 'TO THE EDITOR :The Chain of Mental Ill in West Africa ( Oct. 12 ) highlight the abus that often constitut treatment of mental ill .

Don hard hat , we crowd into a rattl elev cage and descend 6,800 feet to an underground laboratori that remind me of the one in The Andromeda Strain.The Sudburi Neutrino Observatori sat at the end of a long corridor at the bottom of a work nickel mine . In the tunnel abov us miner dug and blast through granit . Dr. McDonald wa after a far less substanti ore .Neutrino are said to pass through Earth almost as easili as through empti space . Dure the flight , theorist believ , neutrino were capabl of chang their ident . Dr. McDonald job wa to catch them in the act . It wa six more year befor he succeed . Earlier thi month he won a share of a Nobel Prize , a climax to a long and perplex tale .I had come to Sudburi on a philosoph quest . I wasnt entir sure I believ in neutrino , which were invent in 1930 to fill a hole in physic . In a type of radioact decay , experiment had measur more energi go in than come out .That is suppos to be imposs , so the fix wa to conjur forth an unseen particl with precis the right characterist to take up the slack . The particl had gone unnot , the argument went , becaus they had no handl for experiment to grab onto  no charg and ( it wa believ at the time ) no mass .Sometim thi explan seem a littl too pat . I knew neutrino were eventu detect , but in way so obliqu that I wonder how physicist could be sure they werent just see what they need to see .By now neutrino are woven so tightli into the mesh of physic that you would have to be a crank to doubt their exist . But when you start peel away the layer of theori , realiti can start feel pretti abstract .Of all the particl in the univers , the onli one our sens can directli regist are photon  particl of light that strike the retina and send electr signal to the brain . Our cruder sens respond to whole glob of matter  larger glob for touch , invis tini glob for smell . Sound , for it part , is the vibrat of matter , a rumbl of the ground or a reverber of the air .Reveal the exist of theoret stuff like neutrino mean coax them into produc photon to be regist by our eye or our instrument . It took a quarter centuri to figur out how to do that , and by a somewhat circuit rout .Like other particl , neutrino , the theori goe , have antimatt counterpart . When an antineutrino collid with a proton , it should transform it into a neutron while an antimatt electron is kick out . It quickli strike a regular electron , explod into two photon fli in opposit direct  tini flash of light .An instant later the neutron is suck into the core of an atom , result in anoth flash . If the time and energi of these scintil are precis in sync , you can say you have glimps a neutrino .In the mid-1950 two experiment , Frederick Rein and Clyde Cowan , put it all togeth . They measur neutrino spew from a nuclear reactor . The reward wa a Nobel Prize .Then thing start get messi . Now that it wa possibl to detect neutrino , physicist had a way of test their theori of sunlight  that it wa gener by nuclear fusion . That meant neutrino should be pour from the sun in drove .In the invers of the reaction use by Rein and Cowan , a neutrino strike a neutron should transform it into a proton and an electron . If the neutron is contain within the core of a chlorin atom , it morph into an argon atom and emit gamma ray . Gamma ray are veri high frequenc light .With a vat of chlorin atom ( in the form of dri clean fluid ) , Raymond Davi Jr. wa first to find thi circumstanti evid ( result in yet anoth Nobel Prize ) . But hi experi is more famou for see onli a fraction of the neutrino requir by solar theori  anoth hole in physic .Mayb the sun wasnt realli power by fusion . Or mayb neutrino were eaten by a black hole lurk insid . By the time I met Dr. McDonald , theorist had ralli around a less radic thought .By then there seem to be three differ flavors of neutrino . Mayb as neutrino stream from the sun , they oscillated between the differ type . Our instrument had been blind to all but one . That is where the Sudburi detector came in . It succeed in regist all three flavor , as signatur of photon .Thi solut to the solar neutrino problem requir a troubl trade-off . For year physicist had celebr the neutrino massless puriti , which allow it to pass at lightspe through anyth in it path . But for neutrino to oscil they had to be saddl with a tini dab of mass . That cant be  it too ugli ,  the great physicist Han Beth remark when he heard the propos . But in the end the altern seem wors .As I rais a doughnut and a cup of takeout coffe to Dr. McDonald and hi crew , I still feel a littl uneasi . Quark , gluon , Higg boson  the stori is the same . Behind the scene , particl decay into other particl , until at the end of the tunnel you see the light . Whether wer read a meter or a comput screen , our knowledg ultim come down to photon .On that trip to Sudburi , Dr. McDonald gave me a nugget of nickel ore . Solid as it seem it is made of atom that consist mostli of empti space . It shimmer a silveri gold becaus photon strike hollow shell of electron and ricochet into my eye . All of our knowledg of the world is so indirect .I find some satisfact in Boswell famou descript of Samuel Johnson disput Bishop Berkeley content that the world is all in our mind . Kick a rock and mayb stub hi toe , he declar of the theori , I refut it thus.', 'Human activ ha had at least as much effect as climat chang on the surviv of anim on the Bahamian island of Abaco , a new studi suggest .Research look at 10,000-year-old fossil found in an underwat cave on Abaco .

A beauti as the day they were collected.Mr. Kroupa and 14 colleagu are in the midst of a vast undertak : digit and publish onlin the museum entir collect of insect , includ high-definit 3-D imag of thousand of particularli import specimen . The research here are not alon . Museum around the globe are tri to har the power of digit technolog to make avail collect that have long lain dormant on shelv and in dusti cabinet .For year , scientif institut have scan imag of specimen drawer or individu in their collect . But technic advanc provid new opportun to creat extraordinarili detail imag and data that may be critic to answer some of the biggest question in conserv biolog , expert say .By look at the histor distribut of a speci as reveal in the collect , for exampl , scientist can determin how the ecolog of a region ha chang becaus of industri , human settlement or climat chang . The old collect provid deep insight into chang in genet divers , crucial for save a speci , inform urban plan or protect vital food resourc in the futur .To realli understand biodivers , you have to look in the museum ,  said Brent Mishler , a professor of plant biolog at the Univers of California , Berkeley .The digit effort also are help scientist creat a perman record of the natur world in a period of rapid extinct .Thi is one way of document what we are about to lose ,  said Quentin Wheeler , an entomologist and presid of the Colleg of Environment Scienc and Forestri at the State Univers of New York . Digit museum specimen will reveal irreplac clue need to reconstruct evolutionari histori , to understand where we and all the other speci came from.In Berlin , the natur histori museum collect consist of more than 35,000 drawer hold about 15 million individu specimen . So far , the team ha scan about 10,000 drawer . Some specimen are select for high-definit scan , which will allow scientist from anywher in the world to examin these color creatur in remark detail , even to maneuv them on screen for close scrutini .We want everyon to see them , the public and research , to see what in the collect ,  said Bernhard Schurian , an imag specialist at the museum who is overse the technic aspect of the project .It is slow , painstak work .Each specimen drawer must be care remov from one of hundr of alder wood cabinet fill six floor of the museum . The drawer are dust off , and a small brush is sometim use to tidi each delic specimen .Some of them are type specimen  individu use to character their speci . An anim is judg to be a member of a given speci by it resembl to the type specimen , the gold standard .For centuri , scientist who want to studi a particular type specimen had to visit the museum where it is kept or have the specimen sent to them . Either way , the potenti for damag wa high : fragil bodi part would sometim fall off dure inspect or transport , caus irrepar damag .Each type specimen is like the Mona Lisa ,  said Katja Seltmann , a biologist at the American Museum of Natur Histori in New York who special in biodivers informat . If an antenna or a leg break , all of a sudden , a realli larg part of inform about that organ is gone.Other effort to digit type specimen are underway . The Atla of Live Australia har the contribut of individu to catalog everi known speci on the contin . The Encyclopedia of Life , brainchild of the renown biologist E.O . Wilson , ha publish more than 1.2 million page with 3.2 million imag of speci .Gener , these project involv  at most  make top , bottom and later imag of specimen . But the Berlin museum is take the idea to a new level .In a cramp , darken room in the basement , individu type specimen are place on a rotat drum in a lightbox and photograph at mani angl with a macro len . The team use comput softwar to stitch the photograph togeth into a singl focus imag , which can be download and view at up to 100 angl .Depend on the size of the insect , as mani as 500 imag are taken at a singl angl ; 3,000 to 5,000 imag are taken of a singl specimen . The result data can add up to more than 100 gigabyt , far too larg to download from the Web .The team reli on compress and an algorithm similar to that use by Googl Map to load onli a few portion of the imag at a time on an individu screen . The result , call ZooSpher , is a magnific detail pictur of the type specimen , avail to anyon anywher .The research here are focus on insect , but other institut have been tri to digit vast collect of plant , mammal and fish . Few have attempt to provid thi level of visual detail .One of the largest effort in the Unit State , call the Integr Digit Biocollect , or iDigBio , is current underway at the Univers of Florida . Fund by the Nation Scienc Foundat , iDigBio ha brought togeth 283 institut in all 50 state , mostli museum and univers , to creat a common languag and process for digit imag of speci .Everybodi know there a tremend amount of inform in natur histori collect ,  said Larri Page , the curat of fish at the Florida Museum of Natur Histori and the director of iDigBio . But the collect are inaccess to virtual everyon . Even scientist work on particular group of organ dont know what contain in the other museums.Current , the iDigBio search portal contain 45 million specimen record and about 12 million imag . But that is not nearli enough , Dr . Page said . He estim there are half a billion specimen in the Unit State alon .The project , in it fifth and final year of fund , ha request support for anoth five year . Dr . Page say the portal will prove an invalu resourc for scientist .In a few year , he said , a scientist studi climat chang might be abl to glean inform from the iDigBio databas about how an insect rang ha chang and make predict about futur trend .The data tell us what occur where at certain period of time , and we can link that to environment data and then look at the chang they anticip ,  Dr . Page said .Right now , the iDigBio project is focus mostli on build of a vast databas of speci record , inform collect by scientist in the field about when and where a particular speci wa found . Initi , the project did not place much emphasi on imag , but that ha chang .I wa skeptic about use of imag when the project first start ,  he said . I thought databas inform wa enough . But imag are becom of huge interest to everyon becaus there is so much inform in them.That is whi the effort in Berlin and elsewher have such potenti . The high-definit imag of type specimen and specimen in gener open up the natur world in a way that scientist onli dream of a decad ago . Scienc stand to benefit not just from the advanc in knowledg gain from worldwid access to these specimen , but also by encourag student to pursu career in biolog or environment work .Thi is a chanc to make everyon awar of how valuabl the data are in natur histori collect , how much they tell us about the natur world ,  Dr .

The develop of offspr from unfertil egg cell is call parthenogenesi .It is common in mani invertebr speci that have two sex for reproduct to occur without input from a male repres . Instead of combin with a male gamet to form a zygot with half of it DNA from each parent , an egg cell give rise to the embryo stage on it own .Onli sinc the late 1800 ha it becom known that such asexu reproduct also occur in some vertebr , includ snake , lizard like the endang Komodo dragon , bird and even shark .Such birth were document onli in captiv repres of these speci , like zoo specimen and domest fowl .

Yellow skin and eyebal are common symptom .In wealthi countri , jaundic newborn are place for sever day under sunlamp that emit extra blue wavelength of light and minim ultraviolet or infrar one .It wa establish dure World War II that artifici sunlight cure jaundic , which more than 28,000 soldier develop after get yellow fever vaccin made from human blood .For year , American research focus on drug to block bilirubin format , while hospit reli on lamp and , in extrem case , transfus to treat patient .But hospit in poor countri may be unabl to afford lamp or may lack a steadi electr suppli to run them .The Stanford team , whose work wa publish last month in The New England Journal of Medicin , test whether real sunlight which is plenti at mani hospit in tropic clime  could be made safe enough for babi to lie in for hour a day .They treat 433 babi for jaundic at a hospit in Lago , Nigeria . Half receiv sunlamp phototherapi , and half slept in outdoor crib or their mothers lap under canopi of plastic film that filter out ultraviolet and infrar ray .The sunlight treatment wa slightli more effect , and the children did not have more sunburn , dehydr or overh .The research have design a small greenhous to be use in windier or colder climat .', 'SYDNEY , Australia  Everi day for a week , So Kawaguchi peer intent into the jar of cold water hold harvest krill egg . None were hatch . In hi laboratori in Hobart , Tasmania , on the edg of the Southern Ocean , he could see that the carbon dioxid he had pump into the ici seawat had kill the egg .We thought the krill might be more robust ,  said Dr. Kawaguchi , a biologist who work for the Australian government Antarct Divis . We were not expect such a clear result.Those key moment in hi laboratori more than seven year ago were pivot in the career of Dr. Kawaguchi , who ha been studi krill for 25 year . Hi recent research ha led to dire predict about how global carbon emiss will significantli reduc the hatch rate of Antarct krill over the next 100 year .Krill , typic about the size of a pinki and similar in appear to shrimp , are one of the most abund anim speci on earth , and a cornerston of the Antarct ecosystem . They form school that can be mile long and mile deep , with thousand of crustacean pack into each cubic foot .Commerci trawler revisit known breed ground , where they can vacuum up thousand of ton of krill over a fish season . Most of the catch is use to feed farm fish . But extract of krill oil for human consumpt is more profit , Steve Nicol , an adjunct professor at the Univers of Tasmania , said .In the Southern Ocean , most marin life is a direct predat of krill or just one step remov . Diminish krill stock can mean less food for squid , whale , seal , fish , penguin and sea bird .Higher level of carbon dioxid in the water mean greater level of ocean acidif ,  said Dr. Kawaguchi , whose laboratori hold the onli research tank in the world use to breed and studi krill . Thi interrupt the physiolog of krill . It stop the egg hatch , or the larva developing.Conservationist want tract of Antarct water protect until scientist better understand the link between differ speci of marin life there .We are concern with the concentr fish around the Antarct Peninsula , which is also the fastest warm place on the planet ,  said Andrea Kavanagh , the Washington-bas director of the Pew Charit Trusts global penguin conserv campaign .In Hobart , Dr. Kawaguchi pump carbon dioxid into hi jar , acidifi the water to mimic condit that might occur over the next three centuri .If we continu with busi as usual , and we dont act on reduc carbon emiss , in that case , there could be a 20 to 70 percent reduct in Antarct krill by 2100 ,  Dr. Kawaguchi said . Bi 2300 , the Southern Ocean might not be suitabl for krill reproduction.From the tip of Patagonia to the Antarct landmass , Antarctica water swirl west to east , but the current is also vertic . The deep water in the Southern Ocean continu rise , come into contact with the atmospher , and sink again .It is like a conveyor belt carri heat and carbon dioxid into the ocean ,  said Dr. Steve Rintoul , an oceanograph with Australia nation scienc agenc , the Commonwealth Scientif and Industri Research Organ . And thi is one reason it can absorb so much heat . The key question is how the acidif caus by the uptak of carbon dioxid will affect ecosystems.Krill egg sink from the water surfac into deeper sea where they hatch . They then swim back to the surfac to eat alga . They grow through around 12 larval stage befor reach adulthood and breed in what Dr. Kawaguchi describ as a complic life cycl .Carbon dioxid level increas the deeper you go ,  said Dr. Kawaguchi , whose lab work ha focus onli on krill egg and larva . Krill egg are inanim . As they sink , they cant avoid area of greater acidity.And as the ocean take up more carbon dioxid , it becom more difficult for sea anim to build shell and exoskeleton .A subgroup of the Commiss for the Conserv of Antarct Marin Live Resourc , which wa establish in 1982 by intern convent to conserv Antarct marin life , said earlier thi year that it hope to better quantifi the abund of krill in the Southern Ocean use acoust instrument .The last survey were complet in 2000 , which mean that the data use to determin catch limit are 15 year old . The Antarct conserv commiss said that around 300,000 ton of krill wa caught in 2014 , significantli lower than the peak of around 500,000 ton caught around 30 year ago when trawler from the former Soviet Union were the biggest krill fisher .In Sydney in Februari , krill scientist , conservationist and King Harald V of Norway establish an Antarct Wildlif Research fund with a $ 500,000 donat for krill research from a Norwegian fisheri compani , Aker BioMarin  the world largest krill fisher . The Antarct convers commiss said Norwegian caught 165,899 ton of krill in 2014 , Korean fisheri took 55,414 ton and Chines 54,303 ton .Dr. Nicol said Aker BioMarin had technolog that allow a trawler to suck up krill from swarm , avoid damag to the krill and other fish it pull in . Trawler can oper year round , but ice melt mean peak fish is now done in winter .Krill is a remark adapt and abund anim ,  said Dr. Nicol , who is also a scientif advis to Aker BioMarin . Can krill adapt to chang condit fast enough ? I hope so . They are remark resilient.Dr. Kawaguchi said he worri that krill may not adapt . We have a lot of thing to think about ,  he said . These experi take a long time and we have start with krill in the veri earli stage of develop . We have yet to understand what happen from stage to stage.', 'Cardiologist recent hail earli result of a studi suggest that mani live might be save if peopl with high blood pressur got it down far below level now recommend . They predict swift chang in treatment practic .But the intens interest in thi big , rigor clinic trial mask a startl truth about heart research : Mani studi are never publish , their find consign to oblivion .It is an issu that is aris in other part of medicin as well , but heart diseas is one area where it ha been especi well document . Hundr of million of dollar ha been go to heart studi that are too small and narrow to yield result meaning enough to get into a journal . In an era of ever-tighten budget , feder health offici acknowledg that money ha been squander on work that make no differ to patient or even to research scientist .Now , a few year after come to that jolt realiz , the influenti feder agenc that fund much of the nation heart research is overhaul it practic , a chang with far-reach implic for the way medic research is fund in thi countri . The result will be the financ of fewer , but deeper , studi , to focu resourc on effort with real-world impact and life-or-death implic .We are much more will to turn down propos trial ,  said Dr. Michael Lauer , who is the newli appoint deputi director for extramur research of that agenc , the Nation Institut of Health . In fact , he ad , we are turn them down.The pronounc shift is shake up a field where chang is usual measur in tini increment . Some question thi new direct .If you want to do thing that are truli innov and cut edg , you sometim have to do thing that are high risk-high gain ,  said Dr. Steven A. Webber , a pediatr cardiologist at Vanderbilt , argu for the need to continu fund small exploratori studi like one he conduct , which he could not complet becaus of unexpect technic issu .Thi rethink of how to studi heart diseas , which kill more than 600,000 American a year , began with an epiphani three year ago : Dr. Lauer and colleagu at the Nation Heart , Lung and Blood Institut discov they had spent $ 2 billion on more than 200 clinic trial over the cours of a decad . But the result of two out of five of the studi either were minev made public or were publish onli after what to scientist were unconscion delay .If a research project is never publish it is as if it never happen ,  Dr. Lauer said .So start next year , the heart institut will requir that all research result be report in a feder databas even if no journal will publish them . In addit to turn down smaller studi , it is insist that the cost of larg studi go way down  even if that mean sacrif data by , for exampl , not gather lab result on peripher question research think are interest .Though some research are unsettl by the new practic , mani agre that money wa often wast under the old system . Five small studi cost less than one larg one , so the temptat , feder offici acknowledg , ha been to stuff the clinic trial portfolio with small studi , especi given the realiti of the feder budget . Fund for the Nation Institut of Health have fallen by 20 percent in inflation-adjust dollar sinc 2006 .It worth understand how pervers  and that the right word  the environ ha been for clinic trial ,  said Dr. Salim Yusuf , a cardiologist at McMaster Univers in Ontario .Dr. Lauer never expect to uncov such a troubl system when he ask for data on the public  or nonpubl  of heart institut studi . The result shock him and hi colleagu , and after some soul search they report their find in The New England Journal of Medicin . They realiz they were air what some said wa the institute dirti laundri in a journal that is all but requir read for medic research . We did it anyway ,  Dr. Lauer said , explain that he could hardli critic other for not publish and then fail to publish hi own result .Other have also unearth stun rate of nonpubl . A Yale studi found more than half of studi fund by the Nation Institut of Health were not publish in the 30 month after they were complet . A group at Duke examin more than 13,000 clinic trial of drug found most had not report result by five year after complet , even though the Food and Drug Administr requir report by one year after a study end . Feder fund studi were less like to report result than those fund by drug compani .A new Yale studi under review at a medic journal found that a failur to publish afflict research equal in prestigi medic center and one that are less well known . If peopl realli knew what wa happen they would be outrag ,  said Dr. Nihar Desai , a Yale scientist who ha been investig nonpubl .Dr. Lauer studi found that trial of treatment with obviou life-or-death mean , like test a way to cut heart attack , almost alway were publish within two year of complet ; 70 percent were publish a year or less after close . Neg or equivoc result did not make ani differ in public rate .But trial with so-cal surrog endpoint  Did cholesterol level rise or fall ? Did peopl walk more each day ?  tend to languish .Mani small studi focus on understand biochem pathway that lead to diseas . For exampl , research would conduct what they call feed trial : particip come to a lab to be fed differ diet , with the food prepar in special research kitchen . Investig then drew the subjects blood to see how their blood sugar or cholesterol level were affect by what they ate .A feed trial definit ha valu and provid insight ,  Dr. Lauer said . But it ha absolut noth to do with what happen in the real world.Anoth chang will come with the design of larg trial . The new emphasi will be on so-cal pragmat trial that look for outcom that matter , like reduct in heart attack or death . Particip in such trial are ordinari peopl of the sort doctor see everi day . They are randomli assign to one group or anoth  to take a drug meant to prevent heart diseas or to take a placebo , for exampl .To cut cost , the institut will requir research to make use of data that are alreadi be collect dure routin care , like inform on episod of chest pain or heart attack .Donald Berri , a statistician at MD Anderson Cancer Center , say there are drawback to do larg studi that use clinic data from electron health record , for exampl , to cut cost . The result , he said , can be the mingl of clinic trial and clinic practic , which have long been kept separ for ethic reason . In a clinic trial , the goal is to get data that will help all patient , wherea in clinic practic , the goal is to help each individu patient .Anoth issu , Dr. Berri said , is the focu on singl , simpl endpoint . The patient and the patient diseas cours should be the endpoint ,  Dr. Berri said . It not just when you die but how you got there.But few would argu that trial design can not be improv .Earlier trial often took year to complet , in part becaus so mani particip were exclud becaus of age or other medic condit .Research had to do all the lab test on the particip and gather their own data on patients clinic histori . These step ad greatli to the cost of trial , which often reach more than $ 50 million or even run into hundr of million . The new plan is to fund studi for no more than $ 1.5 million per year , which mean a total cost well under $ 10 million for a typic trial .As for those studi that languish unpublish , research will be requir to post result on clinicaltrials.gov  whether or not they publish a paper . If the govern is go to pay for these studi , said Dr. Franci S. Collin , director of the Nation Institut of Health , the public should be abl to see the data . And that includ data on all clinic trial , not just one on heart diseas , he ad .Those whose studi are not publish often say it is not their fault . Rhonda Cooper-DeHoff , for exampl , an assist professor of pharmacotherapi and translat research at the Univers of Florida , tri to publish the result of her studi , which she complet in 2009 . She wrote a paper and sent it to three journal , all of which summarili reject it , she said .The studi , involv just two dozen peopl , ask if variou high blood pressur drug worsen sugar metabol in peopl at high risk of diabet .It wa a small studi and our hypothesi wa not proven ,  Dr. Cooper-DeHoff said . That like three strike against me for publication. Her onli option , she reason , would be to turn to an open-access journal that charg author to publish . They are superexpens and accept everyth ,  she said . Last year she decid to post her result on clinicaltrials.gov .Dr. Lauer call a few investig who had not publish their result and heard a varieti of explan .But excus do not assuag the harm that is done , Dr. Lauer emphas , includ what he consid an uneth abandon of particip in those studi .If you subject a person to the risk and hassl of be in a clinic trial , there is an implicit promis that they are give to scienc ,  he said . Give to scienc mean the result get published.', 'Thi month , scientist gather at the Nation Academi of Scienc in Washington to talk about Crispr , a new method for edit gene . In the past coupl of year , the techniqu ha becom so power and access that mani expert are call for limit on it potenti use  especi alter human embryo with chang that could be inherit by futur gener .Among the scientist describ recent advanc wa one of Crispr pioneer , Georg Church of Harvard Medic School . In the midst of hi present , pack with the fine detail of biochemistri and genet , Dr. Church drop a bombshel .In a typic experi , scientist use Crispr to alter a singl gene . But in recent work with pig cell , Dr. Church and hi colleagu use Crispr to alter 62 gene at onc . The research hope that thi achiev may someday make it possibl to use pig organ for transplant into human .But the experi also rais a deeper question : Could scientist someday alter complic human trait by manipul mani gene at onc ?It obvious pretti impress ,  said Ron Weiss , a synthet biologist at M.I.T . who wa not involv in the new studi . But despit the larg number of gene involv , Dr. Weiss and other expert caution that the new work doesnt mean that wev suddenli gain the power to bypass evolut . Crispr doe not allow scientist to manipul gene on a huge scale  yet .Dr. Church experi had it origin in the shortag of organ for transplant . Thousand of peopl die each year wait for heart , lung and liver .It a cruel situat current , that someon who need a heart transplant ha to pin their chanc for a healthi life on the untim death of anoth person ,  said David A. Dunn , an expert on transplant at the State Univers of New York at Oswego .In the 1990 , research explor the possibl of use pig organ in human , a techniqu known as xenotransplant . Scientist hope that pig organ could be cleans of virus and other pathogen that might harm their human host .But that work stall in 1998 , when Jay Fishman and hi colleagu discov a bizarr new risk . Lurk in the pig DNA are viral gene .Theyr call endogen retrovirus  human have them , it turn out . The porcin version ( call PERV , unfortun ) can produc full-blown virus abl to infect other pig cell . When research mix pig and human cell in a petri dish , they found the pig virus infect human cell , as well .It seem imposs to rid pig cell of PERV . They were part of these animals genom ,  said Dr. Fishman , associ director of the transplant center at Massachusett Gener Hospit .Dr. Fishman and other research have been look for way to overcom thi hurdl , without much success . In 2013 , they ask Dr. Church if he would be game to edit the gene of PERV , make them harmless to pig cell , and thu to human .Dr. Church agre to give it a shot , although he didnt think it would work . Other attempt to disabl PERV had fail , mangl DNA so badli that the cell die . But Crispr , it turn out , is well suit to the task .In the latest experi , Dr. Church and hi colleagu first examin pig cell to figur out exactli how mani PERV were contain in the genom . The research found 62 . Had they found thousand , the experi might not have work .The scientist then caught a second lucki break : The DNA wa nearli ident from viru to viru , becaus all of them descend from a singl ancestor that invad the pig genom long ago .To erad these virus , Dr. Church and hi team engin a new set of gene and insert them into pig cell . The gene produc enzym that hunt for PERV and snip out bit of the viral DNA . After two week , the modifi pig cell had alter all of their own viral DNA .After the experi , the virus in the pig genom exhibit littl activ . And despit the drastic genom surgeri , the chromosom show no abnorm and the cell grew normal .Thi work bring us closer to a realiz of a limitless suppli of safe , depend pig organ for transplant ,  Dr. Dunn said . He predict that futur research might lead to PERV-fre pig clone , which could found an entir new line of pig whose organ would be safer for human transplant .Importantli , Dr. Church and hi colleagu didnt alter 62 gene with 62 Crispr molecul . There wa no need : One molecul did the whole job . So far , scientist juggl multipl molecul have manag to alter fewer than six gene simultan .We are certainli free to imagin a world in which parent have hundr of gene in their design babi edit to alter everyth from the color of their eye to their score on intellig test . Thi experi on pig is a far cri from that scenario .But that doesnt mean that scientist wont learn how to alter mani gene in one fell swoop .Dr. Church and hi colleagu have begun experi with Crispr to reduc the risk that patient will reject transplant pig organ , tinker with 25 gene involv in produc molecul on the surfac of pig cell that alert the immun system . The result are not yet publish .We should expect scientist to swiftli expand their gene edit power in the year to come , Dr. Weiss said . Will we be abl to chang 12 gene in 12 second ? That not go to happen.But if you say 12 day , that pretti likely.', 'Caffein improv learn and memori in bee , as it doe in peopl . Scientist know that . But , one might wonder , what do these laboratori find mean in term of the actual live of bee ? It not as if a flower meadow is sprinkl with coffe shop .Except that it is , in a way . Up to 55 percent of flower plant are estim to have caffein nectar . So ani meadow or forest is go to have lot of place to stop by for a jolt .Margaret J. Couvillon of the Univers of Sussex , who studi the behavior of honeybe , want to see how caffein affect bees behavior .What she found wa that bee were drawn to caffein like offic worker to a coffe cart and that the favorit drug of so mani human be chang how bee evalu nectar qualiti .As they report in the journal Current Biolog Dr. Couvillon and her colleagu at the univers , includ Roger Schurch ( her husband ) and Franci L. W. Ratniek , train two group of bee to go to two differ feeder . They were fill with the same nectar , but one had caffein in about the same concentr common in flower .The caffein bee visit their feeder more often than the other bee . They were more loyal to their feeder . And they persist in come to the feeder for day after it wa empti , which the other bee did not .And they danc up a storm . Honeybe commun with the rest of the hive about the sourc of nectar theyv found by shake their abdomen in what is call the waggl danc . They dont alway danc ; it depend on how good the nectar sourc is .The bee that sip high-test nectar were more like to danc than the one who were drink decaf . And they repeat their abdomen shake routin more time  an indic of how much sugar  and therefor calori  the nectar contain .But the caffein nectar wa not nutrit better than the plain nectar . In effect , Dr. Couvillon said , caffein caus the bee to overestim the qualiti of the resource.It make sens that plant would evolv to lace their nectar with caffein . It seem that it would increas bee visit  the more bee visit , the more pollen carri around and the better the plants chanc of reproduct .But caffein doesnt seem to offer much to the bee other than a nice littl buzz . In natur , that mean they might stick to caffeine-lac nectar and miss out on other sourc that are as good or better , Dr. Couvillon said .Bee and flower get someth out of their ancient relationship . But , she said , A with mani partnership , the interest dont alway align. Some bee chew at the base of a flower to get nectar without have to load themselv up with pollen that they have to carri around as they fli .There alway a littl arm race go on ,  she said .']\n"

There are people all over this country who are working like that. Many of them working two jobs — and they used to have one job, and that would take care of them. But, because of wage stagnation, which we’ve had for 40 years, because the fact that they’re punished for working harder if they work that many hours.

And if I can do it with a 90 percent Democrat legislature in Arkansas, there is no excuse for any president not being able to lead in Washington if he knows what the heck he is doing when he gets there.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="29670">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="36" data-total-count="29706">REGAN: Thank you, Governor Huckabee.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="245" data-total-count="29951">SMITH: Senator Santorum, many of our military leaders believe America’s critical infrastructure is vulnerable to a terrorist attack. This is the power in our homes, the water we drink, the Internet and phone systems by which we stay connected.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="167" data-total-count="30118">If attacked, these essential services that underpin American society could come to a grinding halt. Do you have a specific plan to protect us from this type of attack?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="211" data-total-count="30329">SANTORUM: Well, the most devastating attack that could occur is an electromagnetic pulse attack, and that would be an attack that would be triggered by a nuclear explosion in the upper atmosphere of our country.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="211" data-total-count="30540">The best way to stop that from happening is to make sure that those who contemplating and actually war-gaming and talking about using it, Iran, doesn’t get a nuclear weapon so they can’t explode that device.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="30550">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="309" data-total-count="30859">SANTORUM: And the president of the United States has put Iran on a path to a nuclear weapon. And we have done nothing to do anything to harden our grid. There is actually a bill in Congress that would put money forward to try to put redundancy and harden our electric grid so it could actually survive an EMP.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="254" data-total-count="31113">An EMP is a devastating explosion that sends a pulse that knocks out all electric, everything, everything that is connected to any kind — that is wired, that has a circuit board gets fried out. Everything is gone. Cars stop. Planes fall out of the sky.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="483" data-total-count="31596">This is a devastating attack. And this president has done nothing, number one, to take the most probable person to — probable country to launch an attack and stop them, and has done nothing to try to defend us, particularly our electric grid. The bottom line is, I put the original sanctions on the Iranian nuclear program when I was in the United States Senate. I’ve been fighting for 12 years with one thing in mind, that we must stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. And...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="31606">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="296" data-total-count="31902">SANTORUM: Because they’re different than every other country. They do not want a nuclear weapon to defend themselves. They want a nuclear weapon to have theological ends to bring about their mahdi so they can control the world. And that is the most serious threat facing this country right now.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="31912">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="298" data-total-count="32210">SMITH: Senator Santorum, I want to stay with you on this, moving to jobs and the economy. In his State of the Union Address the other night, President Obama touted his record on jobs, citing more than 14 million new jobs and boasted of nearly 900,000 manufacturing jobs added in the past six years.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="49" data-total-count="32259">Do you dispute his track record of creating jobs?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="295" data-total-count="32554">SANTORUM: Well, the numbers just don’t add up. I mean, they have not added manufacturing jobs. Manufacturing jobs have been lost in this country, 2 million of them. The bottom line is that this president has done more to take jobs away from the hard-working people who are struggling the most.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="284" data-total-count="32838">And that’s folks who are, as I said, the 74 percent of Americans who don’t have a college degree. And they’re out there talking about, well, we’re going to provide free college for everybody. Well, who is going to pay for it? The 74 percent that don’t have a college degree.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="329" data-total-count="33167">They’re not — nobody is focused. Let’s just be honest, nobody is focused on the people who are struggling the most in America today. We talk about immigration. Talk about the president’s immigration plan. He wants to bring in more and more people into this country. Let people who are here illegally stay in this country.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="192" data-total-count="33359">Almost all of the people who are here illegally, and most of the people who came here legally over the last 20 years, they’re working in wage-earning jobs. That is why wages have flat-lined.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="242" data-total-count="33601">And we have unfortunately two political parties with most of the candidates in this field for some form of amnesty, some form of allowing people to stay here even though they’re here illegally and for increasing levels of legal immigration.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="165" data-total-count="33766">I’m someone who believes that we need to be the party that stands for the American worker. And when we say we need to send people back, I mean we send people back.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="304" data-total-count="34070">And let me just make one point. I was in Storm Lake, Iowa, the other day, near a Tyson’s plant, 91 percent of the kids that go to the elementary school there are minority kids. And they said, well, what are you going to do with all of these people, their families, they’ve lived here for a long time?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="125" data-total-count="34195">I said, I’m going to give them a gift.

They learned English language. They learned about capitalism. They learned about democracy. You want to stop flow of immigrants?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="76" data-total-count="34509">Let’s send six million Mexicans, Hondurans, Guatemalans, El Savadorians...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="12" data-total-count="34521">(BELL RINGS)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="122" data-total-count="34643">... back into their country, so they can start a renaissance in their country so they won’t be coming over here anymore.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="34653">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="35" data-total-count="34688">REGAN: Senator Santorum, thank you.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="150" data-total-count="34838">SMITH: Governor Huckabee, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Admiral Mike Mullen, has said the greatest threat to our security is our national debt.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="244" data-total-count="35082">Our national debt is now on pace to top $19 trillion. Yet, you as well as Ms. Fiorina have laid forward no plan to reform entitlements. How can you say you’re going to pay down our country’s debt without cutting Social Security or Medicare?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="209" data-total-count="35291">HUCKABEE: Well, first of all, let’s just remember that Social Security is not the government’s money, it belongs to the people who had it taken out of their checks involuntarily their entire working lives.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="35301">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="286" data-total-count="35587">HUCKABEE: For the government to say, well it is fault of working people that we have a Social Security problem, no. It is the fault of a government that used those people’s money for something other than protecting those people’s accounts. So let’s not blame them and punish them.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="35597">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="627" data-total-count="36224">HUCKABEE: But here is a fact, and I sometimes hear Republicans say well, we’re going to have to cut this and extend the age. You know what I think a lot of times when I hear people say, well, let’s make people work to their 70. That sounds great for white-collar people who sat at a desk most of their lives. You ever talk to somebody that stood on concrete floor for the first 40 years of their working life? Do you think they can stand another five years or 10 years, many of them will retired virtually crippled because they worked hard. And we’re going to punish them some more? I don’t think so. Here’s the fact.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="36234">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="276" data-total-count="36510">HUCAKBEE: Four percent economic growth, we fully fund Social Security and Medicare. Our problem is not that Social Security is just too generous to seniors. It isn’t. Our problem is that our politicians have not created the kind of policies that would bring economic growth.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="93" data-total-count="36603">And I still support strongly that we get rid of the 77,000 pages of the monstrous tax code...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="36613">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="211" data-total-count="36824">HUCKABEE: ... pass the fair tax, supercharge this economy with the rocket fuel that happens with the consumption tax and we don’t have to cut Social Security to any senior who has worked their lifetime for it.</p><figure id="1click-FD" class="interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-small">

That’s according to Pew Research. The same research revealed a widening income gap in America. The rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="77" data-total-count="37721">What will you do to strengthen a middle class that is no longer the majority?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="263" data-total-count="37984">FIORINA: For decades, the professional political class in both parties has been talking about the middle class. For decades, Republicans in particular have been talking about reducing the size and scope of government, spending less money, reducing the complexity.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="75" data-total-count="38059">And yet, for 40 years, the government has gotten bigger and more expensive.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="167" data-total-count="38226">We now have a 75,000 plus page tax code, although politicians have run for office for decades promising reform. And all the while, middle class incomes have stagnated.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="140" data-total-count="38366">You see, when government gets bigger and bigger, more powerful, the rich get richer, the poor get poorer and the middle class gets squeezed.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="157" data-total-count="38523">We need to understand who the job creators are in this country, because we need more jobs to grow the middle class and to grow the wages of the middle class.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="17" data-total-count="38540">Who creates jobs?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="69" data-total-count="38609">Small businesses, new businesses, family-owned businesses. (APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="96" data-total-count="38705">FIORINA: They create two thirds of the new jobs in this country and they employ half the people.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="210" data-total-count="38915">I started out typing for a nine person real estate firm. My husband Frank started out driving a tow truck for a family-owned auto body shop. And we are crushing small businesses and destroying the middle class.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="170" data-total-count="39085">So here’s my blueprint to take back America. Let us first actually reform the tax code from 73,000 pages down to three. There’s a 20-year-old plan to do exactly that.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="371" data-total-count="39456">And then let us begin piece by piece to focus on every single dollar the government spends, so that we will spend less overall and still have enough for our priorities. And that requires the government to budget the way you do at home — examine every dollar, cut any dollar, move any dollar. The fancy term for that is zero- based budgeting, but I call it common sense.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="47" data-total-count="39503">Citizens, we’ve got to take our country back.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="39513">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="30" data-total-count="39543">SMITH: Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="39553">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="249" data-total-count="39802">REGAN: Governor Huckabee, you know it used to be you could graduate from high school and get a pretty good job at the local factory, enough to take care of your family and yourself. Those days seem to be gone. It’s pretty hard to do that nowadays.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="169" data-total-count="39971">Businesses are increasingly turning to automation to increase their productivity levels. It’s happening right here, in fact, at the Boeing factory in North Charleston.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="79" data-total-count="40050">The president says automation threatens workers’ ability to get higher wages.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="23" data-total-count="40073">Do you agree with that?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="34" data-total-count="40107">And if so, do you have a solution?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="121" data-total-count="40228">HUCKABEE: Let me go back to the reason so many people are having a hard time getting ahead. The tax system punishes them.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="204" data-total-count="40432">Think about this. If you work really hard and you start moving up the economic ladder, you get bumped into a different tax bracket. So the government thinks it deserves more of your hard work than you do.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="279" data-total-count="40711">And it’s one of the reasons that no matter how many different reforms you have to a tax on people’s productivity, you’re still taxing their work, their savings. You’re taxing their capital gains, inheritance, dividends, you’re taxing everything that produces something.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="237" data-total-count="40948">And it’s way I really believe it’s time to do something bold, not something minute. This is no time for a tap of the hammer, a twist of the screwdriver. It’s time for something big. That’s why the fair tax transforms our economy.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="40958">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="246" data-total-count="41204">HUCKABEE: And we don’t punish workers. It’s the only way we’re going to get middle class people moving ahead again, because the harder they work, the more they keep. No payroll tax deducted from their checks. They get their entire paycheck.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="41214">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="306" data-total-count="41520">HUCKABEE: And, one of the most important parts, it’s built on the common sense with which we raised our kids, and trained dogs. You reward behavior you want more of. And, you punish behavior you want less of. That’s how I raise kids, it’s how I trained our dogs, and folks, it’s not that difficult.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="304" data-total-count="41824">We now punish the behavior we say we want more of by taxing it, and we reward the behavior that we say we want less of, so if you make a good investment, we punish you with a tax. If you make a bad investment you can write that off and the rest of the taxpayers will help subsidize you, and bail you out.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="41834">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="46" data-total-count="41880">REGAN: Thank you very much, Governor Huckabee.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="382" data-total-count="42262">Senator Santorum, 40% of babies born today are born to single moms. That’s twice as high as reported back in 1980, and it’s 11 times as high as in 1940. Studies show that children are always better off economically, most often — and emotionally, with two parents in a household. From a policy perspective, should the government be doing anything to encourage family formation?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="398" data-total-count="42660">SANTORUM: You know, we’ve had this debate about the economy, and we haven’t talked the one issue now increasingly even the right, and even the are coming to agreement. I’ve run around doing 300 town hall meetings talking about a book written by a liberal Harvard sociologist, not a normal thing for me to be talking about, but I now name Robert Putnam who wrote a book called, “Our Kids”.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="383" data-total-count="43043">And, he wrote this book, I think, ostensibly to support the Democratic argument that the middle of America’s hollowing out, and income gap is widening, and rich are getting richer. When he studied all the information as to what was going on, he realized that the biggest reason that we’re seeing the hollowing out of the middle of America is the breakdown of the American family.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="487" data-total-count="43530">The reality is that if you’re a single parent — a child of a single parent, and you grew up in a single parent family neighborhood, you went to that single parent family school, the chance of you ever, ever reaching the top 20% of income earners is 3% in America. At least — I don’t know about you, but that’s not good enough. And, we have been too politically correct in this country because we don’t want to offend anybody to fight for the lives of our children. (APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="797" data-total-count="44327">You want — You want to be shocked? You read the first few chapters of Mr. — Dr. Putnam’ book. He talks about Port Clinton, Ohio and growing up there in the 1950’s, and how poor kids actually survived and did well, even though they were poor and disadvantaged. But, then he goes to the towns today and these kids are failing, and failing miserably. They don’t even have a shot, and we won’t even have the courage to have leadership at the federal level — not with legislation, but the most powerful tool a president have, the bully pulpit to encourage each and everyone of you, churches and businesses, and educators, and community leaders to let’s have a national campaign to rebuild the American family, and give every child its birthright which is a Mom and a Dad who loves them.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="30" data-total-count="44357">That will change this economy.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="21" data-total-count="44378">(CHEERING & APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="17" data-total-count="44395">REGAN: Thank you.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="26" data-total-count="44421">SMITH: Thank you, Senator.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="93" data-total-count="44514">We’re not finished yet.

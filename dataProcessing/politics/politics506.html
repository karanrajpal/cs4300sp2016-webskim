He was the longest-serving member of the court, appointed by President Reagan in 1986. Justice Scalia was the court’s leading conservative, and even those who disagreed with his opinions regarded him as a brilliant legal scholar. Please join us and the candidates on our stage in a moment of silence for Justice Antonin Scalia. Thank you.</p><div id="story-ad-1" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

Mr. Trump, I want to start with you. You’ve said that the president shouldn’t nominate anyone in the rest of his term to replace Justice Scalia. If you were president and had a chance, with 11 months left to go in your term, wouldn’t it be an abdication, to conservatives in particular, not to name a conservative justice with the rest of your term?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="340" data-total-count="3247">TRUMP: Well, I can say this. If the president, and if I were president now, I would certainly want to try and nominate a justice. I’m sure that, frankly, I’m absolutely sure that President Obama will try and do it. I hope that our Senate is going to be able — Mitch, and the entire group, is going to be able to do something about it.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="211" data-total-count="3458">In times of delay, we could have a Diane Sykes, or you could have a Bill Pryor — we have some fantastic people.

Justice Scalia was a real believer, obviously, in the strict word of the Constitution. Now, Harry Reid says that a failure to fill his vacancy would be, quote, “shameful abdication of one of the Senate’s most essential constitutional responsibilities.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="31" data-total-count="4111">Where do you come down on this?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="384" data-total-count="4495">KASICH: Well, John, first of all, if I were president, we wouldn’t have the divisions in the country we have today. I do want to take a second as we reflected on Judge Scalia, it’s amazing — it’s not even two minutes after the death of Judge Scalia, nine children here today, their father didn’t wake up. His wife, sad, but I just wish we hadn’t run so fast into politics.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="659" data-total-count="5154">Here’s my concern about this. The country is so divided right now, and now we’re going to see another partisan fight take place. I really wish the president would think about not nominating somebody. If you were to nominate somebody, let’s have him pick somebody that’s going to have unanimous approval, and such widespread approval across the country that this could happen without a lot of recrimination. I don’t think that’s going to happen, and I would like the president just to, for once here, put the country first. We’re going to have an election for president very soon, and the people will understand what is at stake in that election.</p>        <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#story-continues-3">Continue reading the main story</a>

And when our Constitution was put in place, the average age of death was under 50, and therefore the whole concept of lifetime appointments for Supreme Court judges and federal judges was not considered to be a big deal.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="497" data-total-count="6640">Obviously, that has changed, and it’s something that probably needs to be looked at pretty carefully at some point. But, we need to start thinking about the divisiveness that is going on in our country. I looked at some of the remarks that people made after finding out that Justice Scalia had died, and they were truly nasty remarks. And that we have managed to get to that position in our country is truly a shame.

We are one justice away from a Supreme Court that will strike down every restriction on abortion adopted by the states.

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="367" data-total-count="17939" id="story-continues-11">RUBIO: Well, let me tell you what has happened a couple of years ago. One of the hardest decisions you’ll ever make in Congress is when you are asked by the president to authorize the use of force in a conflict, because you are now putting your name, on behalf of the people of your state, behind a military action, where Americans in uniform could lose their life.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="511" data-total-count="18450">So, in 2014, Barack Obama said he would not take military action against Assad unless it was authorized by the Senate, beginning on the Committee of Foreign Relations, where I am one of its members. And it was hard because you looked at the pictures. I saw the same images people saw. I’m the father of children. I saw the images of these little children — been gassed and poisoned by their own leaders, and we were angry. Something had to happen, and there was the sense that we needed to seek retribution.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="359" data-total-count="18809">And then I looked at Barack Obama’s plan. Barack Obama’s plan, which John Kerry later described as unbelievably small, and I concluded that that attack would not only not help the situation, it would make it actually worse. It would allow Assad to stand up to the United States of America, survive a strike, stay in power and actually strengthen his grip.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="196" data-total-count="19005">So it was a difficult decision to make, and when we only had a few days to look at and make a decision on it, and I voted against Barack Obama’s plan to use force, and it was the right decision.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="54" data-total-count="19059">DICKERSON: Dr. Carson, I want to ask you a question...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="19069">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="415" data-total-count="19484">Dr. Carson, you said you’ve had more 2 a.m. — 2 a.m. phone calls than anybody up on this stage. But when those 2 a.m. phone calls came, you operated on a foundation of all of that amazing medical work that you did, all of that learning. So if you were to be president, though, you wouldn’t have the political foundation that hones those instincts when the 2 a.m. phone call comes. So isn’t that a liability?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="268" data-total-count="19752">CARSON: No, it isn’t. First of all, let me go back to your first question for me.

The lack of leadership in this country by Barack Obama, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, thinking that this is a policy that works, this policy of containment with ISIS. It’s a complete, unmitigated disaster. And to allow Russia now to have influence in Syria makes it harder, but we need to destroy ISIS and dispose of Assad to create a stable Syria so that the four million refugees aren’t a breeding ground for Islamic jihadists.</p><div id="story-ad-11" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

The tragedy of it is that we’re still embroiled. And, frankly, if there weren’t weapons of mass destruction, we should never have gone. I don’t believe the United States should involve itself in civil wars. Civil wars are not in our direct interest, and if you — and look, I served on a defense committee for 18 years and was called into the Pentagon after 9/11 by Secretary Rumsfeld to deal with some of the most serious problems that we faced.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="299" data-total-count="35606">The fact is, is that we should go to war when it is our direct interest.

And when you go in and you remove one of those dictators, unless you have an appropriate plan for replacing them, you’re going to have chaos.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="153" data-total-count="38264">Now, fortunately, we were able to stabilize the situation, and it was the current administration that turned tail and ran and destabilized the situation.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="38274">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="258" data-total-count="38532">Now, having said that, in terms of the rules of engagement, I was talking about, you know, Obama has said, you know, we shouldn’t bomb tankers, you know, coming out of refineries because there may be people in there, or because the environment may be hurt.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="74" data-total-count="38606">You know, that’s just asinine thinking.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has estimated that your ideas would cost an additional $12 trillion to $15 trillion over the next 10 years and that we would have to have annual economic growth of anywhere from 7.7 percent to 9 percent annually to pay for them. Are you proposing more than you can actually deliver, at least not without big deficits?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="563" data-total-count="40379">TRUMP: First of all, the — when you say I’m the only candidate, if you listen to the Democrats, they want to do many things to Social Security, and I want to do them on its own merit. You listen to them, what they want to do to Social Security, none of these folks are getting elected, O.K., whether they can do it or not. I’m going to save Social Security. I’m going to bring jobs back from China. I’m going to bring jobs back from Mexico and from Japan, where they’re all — every country throughout the world — now Vietnam, that’s the new one.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="416" data-total-count="40795">They are taking our jobs. They are taking our wealth. They are taking our base. And you and I have had this discussion. We’re going to make our economy strong again. I’m lowering taxes. We have $2.5 trillion offshore. We have 2.5 trillion that I think is actually five trillion because the government has no idea when they say 2.5, they have no idea what they’re doing or saying, as they’ve proven very well.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="306" data-total-count="41101">We’re going to bring that money back. You take a look at what happened just this week. China bought the Chicago Stock Exchange, China, a Chinese company. Carrier is moving to Mexico, air conditioning company. Not only the ones I talk about all the time, Nabisco and Ford and — they’re all moving out.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="211" data-total-count="41312">We have an economy that last quarter, G.D.P. didn’t grow.

But how would you actually do that? Can I ask you? Because right now, Social Security and Medicare...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="60" data-total-count="41591">TRUMP: Because you have tremendous waste. I’ll tell you...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="79" data-total-count="41670">STRASSEL: They take up two-thirds of the federal budget, and they’re growing.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="591" data-total-count="42261">TRUMP: You have tremendous waste, fraud and abuse. That we’re taking care of. That we’re taking care of. It’s tremendous. We have in Social Security right now thousands and thousands of people that are over 106 years old. Now, you know they don’t exist. They don’t exist. There’s tremendous waste, fraud and abuse, and we’re going to get it. But we’re not going to hurt the people who have been paying into Social Security their whole life and then all of a sudden they’re supposed to get less. We’re bringing our jobs back. We’re going to make our economy great again.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="22" data-total-count="42283">GARRETT: Senator Cruz.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="42293">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="249" data-total-count="42542">John mentioned this is about dollars and incentives. We also want to talk about economic growth engagements. You have proposed a consumption tax, you called it the “back tax.” Some analysts compare it more to an attributed “value-added tax.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="339" data-total-count="42881">From the perspective from economic growth in building wages, how does that work, and how would you address those longstanding conservative concerns that something approaching the “value-added tax” would be used to constantly increase those rates to pay for future government spending and become an escalator of taxation, not of growth?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="386" data-total-count="43267">CRUZ: Well, let me say it at the outset that everyone here understands — everyone understands that how — that the middle class has been left behind in the last seven years of the Obama economy, and we’ve got to bring jobs back. We’ve got to get people back to work. We’ve got to get wages going up again. We’ve got to get people moving from part-time work to full-time work.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="251" data-total-count="43518">We all agree on that, but it’s not going to be solved with magic pixie dust. It’s just going to be solved by declaring into the air, “Let there be jobs.” We actually have to understand the principles that made America great in the first place.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="277" data-total-count="43795">Now, where do you get economic growth? If you look at cause and effect over our nation’s history, every time we lessen the burden of Washington on small-business owners, on job creators, we see incredible economic growth. You do that through tax reform and regulatory reform.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="370" data-total-count="44165">My tax plan — typical family of four, first $36,000 you earn, you pay nothing in taxes — no income taxes, no payroll taxes, no nothing. Above 10 percent, everyone pays the same simple, flat 10 percent income rate. It’s flat and fair. You can fill out your taxes on a postcard, and we abolish the I.R.S. If you want to see the postcard, I’ve got it on my website.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="381" data-total-count="44546">GARRETT: Now, the question — conservatives have sort of this idea conceptually for a long time, but especially on this consumption value-added tax system. In Europe, where it exists, it has become an escalator of taxation to feed government spending, and that’s why conservatives have long resisted it. Why and what would you do as president to make sure that doesn’t happen?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="236" data-total-count="44782">CRUZ: Now, Major, the business flat tax that is in my tax plan is not a VAT. A VAT in Europe is a sales tax. The business flat tax is not a sales tax, it is a tax of 16 percent opposed fairly and evenly across the board on all business.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="552" data-total-count="45334">One of the things that’s critical is we’re doing that in conjunction with abolishing the corporate income tax, with abolishing the Obamacare taxes, with abolishing the payroll taxes, which are the biggest taxes paid by most working Americans, and with abolishing the death tax, which is cruel and unfair. And you asked about economic growth — the nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimated a simple flat tax that would produce 4.9 million new jobs, it would increase capital investment by 44 percent and would lift everyone’s income by double digits.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="114" data-total-count="45448">That’s how you turn the country around, not just hoping and praying for it, but implementing policies that work.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="58" data-total-count="45506">STRASSEL: O.K., I have a question, a related tax question.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="289" data-total-count="45795">Senator Rubio, you have the highest tax rate of anyone up on the stage in terms of the top tax rates, 35 percent. Some economists say, “It would limit its potential to boost economic growth.” You do that so that you will have more revenue to pay for a tripling of the Child Tax Credit.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="155" data-total-count="45950">Normally, it’s liberals who like to use the tax code to insert social policy. Why should conservatives who want to tax adopt the other side’s approach?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="220" data-total-count="46170">RUBIO: Well, because I’m influencing social policy — this is their money. This is the money of parents. You don’t earn the tax credit unless you’re working. That’s your money, it doesn’t belong to government.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="273" data-total-count="46443">Here’s what I don’t understand. If a business takes their money and they invest in the piece of the equipment, they get to write off their taxes.

Family formation is the most important thing in society. So what my tax plan does, is it does create, especially for working families, an additional Child Tax Credit. So that parents who are working get to keep more of their own money, not the government’s money, to invest in their children to go to school, to go to a private school, to buy a new backpack.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="370" data-total-count="47235">Let me tell you, if you’re a parent that’s struggling, then you know that $50 a month is the difference between a new pair of shoes this month or not getting a new pair of shoes for your kids. I’m going to have a tax plan that is pro-family, because the family is the most important institution in society.

In 2013, you pushed through a Medicaid reform in your state over the rejections of many of the Republicans in your state.

It’s not the end of the world that private equity people and hedge fund folks that are, right now, getting capital gains treatment for the income they earn, pay ordinary income like everybody else in this room. That’s not a problem at all. What we need to do is reform the tax code to simplify the rates, to shift power away from Washington, D.C.

Politicians are often accused of glossing over any hard choices people have to make, just always selling happy, nice things.

But here’s what — here’s what people need to know. People need to know that free college is not — it’s a non-starter. You know, you have to look at our economic situation. We’re on the verge of economic collapse and, you know, we’re — it’s not just the $19 trillion, but it’s also the $200 trillion in unfunded liabilities.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="467" data-total-count="87452">What we need to think about is, what does that do to the average person? When we have a debt of that nature, it causes the Fed to change their policy, it causes the central bank to keep the — the rates low, and who does does that affect? Mr. Average, who used to go to the bank every Friday and put part of his check in the bank and watch it grow over three decades and be able to retire with a nice nest egg, that’s gone.

The first thing we have to do is grow the economy, and I know the formula because I was chairman in Washington when we balanced the budget and created so many jobs, and the same that we’ve been able to do in Ohio. You need common-sense regulations so small business can flourish, you need lower taxes both on business and individuals, and you need a fiscal plan to be able to get ourselves in a situation where people can predict a little bit about the future when it comes to the fiscal issues.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="199" data-total-count="88835">And when you have that formula, combined with work force that’s trained, you can explode the economy and create many jobs.

And Reagan had a vision for America’s future. And if you think about what Ronald Reagan inherited, it’s not unlike what the next president is going to inherit.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="253" data-total-count="97082">This is the worst president we’ve had in 35 years, 35 years back would have made it Jimmy Carter.

Our standing in the world was in decline. We had hostages being held in Iran. Our economy was in bad shape.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="246" data-total-count="97628">The American people were scared about the future.

You’ve been fantastic. And look, what I want you to know is I’m going to send a lot of power, money and influence back to where we all live. But as I’ve traveled around South Carolina, I’ve noticed something. You know, it’s that people have a sense that you’re not going to wait on a president. You know, when I was a kid, we didn’t wait on presidents to come to that little blue-collar town and fix things.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="287" data-total-count="99033">You know, the Lord made all of us special. The Lord wants us to be connected. I believe we’re part of a very big mosaic. And I’ll send the power back. And whoever gets elected president here, hopefully will take care of the issue of jobs and wages and Social Security and the border.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="557" data-total-count="99590">But the spirit of the America rests in all of us. It’s in our guts. It’s taking care of our children. It’s taking care of the lady next door who just lost her husband. It’s fixing the schools where we live and telling kids to stay off drugs. You see, I think what the Lord wants is for to us engage, and in America, the spirit of America doesn’t come from the top down. The spirit of America rests in us. And I want to call on everyone in America to double down and realize that you were made special to heal this country and lift it for everyone.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="75" data-total-count="99665">Thank you all very much.

Some people say it’s the new normal, but there’s nothing normal about it in an exceptional American.

We, the people, can stop that decline, starting right here in South Carolina. If all the people who say, “I love Ben Carson and his policies, but he can’t win,” vote for me, not only can we win, but we can turn this thing around.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="362" data-total-count="100753">You know, we have this manipulation by the political class and by the media telling us who we’re supposed to pick and how we’re supposed to live.

The next president is going to be confronted with an unforeseen challenge. That’s almost certain. It could be a pandemic, a major natural disaster or an attack on our country. The question for South Carolinians and Americans is who do you want to have sitting behind the big desk in the Oval Office? Because that’s the question. It’s not the things we’re talking about today. It’s the great challenge that may happen. I believe I will have a steady hand as commander in chief and president of the United States. I will unite this country around common purposes because I did it as governor of the state of Florida.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="175" data-total-count="101631">When I was governor, we had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms in 16 months.

Our economy’s flat, it’s not creating the jobs it once did, and people struggle living paycheck to paycheck. Our culture’s in trouble. Wrong is considered right and right is considered wrong.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="275" data-total-count="102584">All the things that once held our families together are now under constant assault. And around the world, America’s reputation is in decline. Our allies don’t trust us, our adversaries don’t fear us, Iran captures our sailors and parades them before the world on video.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="309" data-total-count="102893">These are difficult times, but 2016 can be a turning point. That’s why I’m running for president, and that’s why I’m here today to ask you for your vote.

And we will rebuild the U.S. military so no one will there test it.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="138" data-total-count="103551">Vote for me. I will unify this party. I will grow it.

Our country literally hangs in the balance.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="276" data-total-count="104000">Do you want another Washington deal maker who will do business as usual, cut deals with the Democrats, grow government, grow debt and give up our fundamental liberties? Or do you want a conservative, a proven conservative that will stand and fight with you each and every day?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="185" data-total-count="104185">Listen, repealing Obamacare is not going to be easy. Passing a simple flat tax that abolishes the I.R.S. is not going to be easy, but if we stand with the American people, we can do it.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="303" data-total-count="104488">And today, we saw just how great the stakes are. Two branches of government hang in the balance. Not just the presidency but the Supreme Court. If we get this wrong, if we nominate the wrong candidates, the Second Amendment, life, marriage, religious liberty — every one of those hangs in the balance.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="365" data-total-count="104853">My little girls are here. I don’t want to look my daughters in the eyes and say, “We lost their liberties.” Who do you know will defend the Constitution and Bill of Rights? And as a commander in chief, who do you know will stand up to our enemies as the clam, steady, deliberate, strength to defeat our enemies, to secure our borders and to keep America safe.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="46" data-total-count="104899">DICKERSON: Mr. Trump, your closing statements?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="17" data-total-count="104916">TRUMP: Thank you.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="228" data-total-count="105144">Politicians are all talk, no action.

We don’t win with health care, we don’t win with ISIS and the military, we don’t take care of our vets, we don’t care of our borders, we don’t win. We are going to start winning again. We are not going to be controlled by people that are special interests and lobbyists that everybody here has contributed to. And you know what, they do exactly what those folks want them to do.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="139" data-total-count="105861">We are going to make our country great, and we’re going to do the right thing.

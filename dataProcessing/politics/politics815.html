We’ll have questions from the Youtube community throughout the debate.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="320" data-total-count="1454">This is a critical point in the race. You’ve been defining your differences with each other especially vigorously in the last week on the campaign trail. We’re here to facilitate this conversation on behalf of the voters so that they know exactly where you stand as you face off tonight. Let’s have a great debate.</p><div id="story-ad-1" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

As we honor the extraordinary life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., it’s important not only that we remember what he stood for, but that we pledge to continue his vision to transform our country. As we look out at our country today, what the American people understand is we have an economy that’s rigged, that ordinary Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, 47 million people living in poverty, and almost all of the new income and wealth going to the top one percent.SANDERS: And then, to make a bad situation worse, we have a corrupt campaign finance system where millionaires and billionaires are spending extraordinary amounts of money to buy elections.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="109" data-total-count="3433">This campaign is about a political revolution to not only elect the president, but to transform this country.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="25" data-total-count="3458">HOLT: Senator, thank you.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="3468">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="53" data-total-count="3521">And Governor O’Malley, your opening statement, sir.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="124" data-total-count="3645">O’MALLEY: Thank you.

It is thinking big. It is understanding that in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, we should have health care for every man, woman, and child as a right that we should raise the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour; that we have got to create millions of decent- paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="325" data-total-count="5955">So, what my first days are about is bringing America together, to end the decline of the middle class, to tell the wealthiest people in this country that yes, they are going to start paying their fair share of taxes, and that we are going to have a government that works for all of us, and not just big campaign contributors.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="5965">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="101" data-total-count="6066">HOLT: Secretary Clinton, same question, my first 100 days in office, my top three priorities will be.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="238" data-total-count="6304">CLINTON: I would work quickly to present to the Congress my plans for creating more good jobs in manufacturing, infrastructure, clean and renewable energy, raising the minimum wage, and guaranteeing, finally, equal pay for women’s work.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="15" data-total-count="6319">I would also...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="6329">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="388" data-total-count="6717">I would also be presenting my plans to build on the Affordable Care Act and to improve it by decreasing the out-of-pocket costs by putting a cap on prescription drug costs; by looking for ways that we can put the prescription drug business and the health insurance company business on a more stable platform that doesn’t take too much money out of the pockets of hard-working Americans.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="435" data-total-count="7152">And third, I would be working, in every way that I knew, to bring our country together. We do have too much division, too much mean- spiritedness. There’s a lot we have to do on immigration reform, on voting rights, on campaign finance reform, but we need to do it together. That’s how we’ll have the kind of country for the 21st century that we know will guarantee our children and grandchildren the kind of future they deserve.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="7162">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="41" data-total-count="7203">HOLT: Governor O’Malley, same question.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="455" data-total-count="7658">O’MALLEY: Thank you. First of all, I would lay out an agenda to make wages go up again for all Americans, rather than down. Equal pay for equal work, making it easier rather than harder for people to join labor unions and bargain collectively for better wages; getting 11 million of our neighbors out of the underground shadow economy by passing comprehensive immigration reform, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, however we can, wherever we can.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="254" data-total-count="7912">Secondly, I believe the greatest business opportunity to come to the United States of America in 100 years is climate change.

We have not had a new agenda for America’s cities since Jimmy Carter. We need a new agenda for America cities that will invest in the talents and skills in our people, that will invest in CBVG transportation, infrastructure and transit options, and make our cities the leading edge in this move to a redesigned built clean green energy future that will employ our people.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="35" data-total-count="8503">HOLT: All right governor thank you.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="280" data-total-count="8783">We’ve all laid out large visions and we’re going to cover a lot of the ground you talked about as we continue in the evening. The last couple of weeks of this campaign have featured some of the sharpest exchanges in the race. Let’s start with one of them, the issue of guns.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="230" data-total-count="9013">Senator Sanders, last week Secretary Clinton called you quote, “a pretty reliable vote for the gun lobby.” Right before the debate you changed your position on immunity from lawsuits for gun manufacturers, can you tell us why?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="368" data-total-count="9381">SANDERS: Well, I think Secretary Clinton knows that what she says is very disingenuous. I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA. I was in 1988, there were three candidates running for congress in the state of Vermont, I stood up to the gun lobby and came out and maintained the position that in this country we should not be selling military style assault weapons.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="373" data-total-count="9754">I have supported from day one and instant background check to make certain that people who should have guns do not have guns. And that includes people of criminal backgrounds, people who are mentally unstable. I support what President Obama is doing in terms of trying to close the gun show loop holes and I think it should be a federal crime if people act as dormant (ph).</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="211" data-total-count="9965">We have seen in this city a horrendous tragedy of a crazed person praying with people in the coming up and shooting nine people. This should not be a political issue. What we should be doing is working together.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="177" data-total-count="10142">And by the way, as a senator from a rural state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in an excellent position to bring people together to fight the sensible...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="135" data-total-count="10277">HOLT: Senator, but you didn’t answer the question that you did change your position on immunity from gun manufacturers.

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="436" data-total-count="10713" id="story-continues-7">SANDERS: What I have said, is that gun manufacturer’s liability bill has some good provisions among other things, we’ve prohibited ammunition that would’ve killed cops who had protection on. We have child safety protection work on guns in that legislation. And what we also said, “is a small mom and pop gun shop who sells a gun legally to somebody should not be held liable if somebody does something terrible with that gun.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="119" data-total-count="10832">So what I said is, “ I would re-look at it.” We are going to re- look at it and I will support stronger provisions.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="70" data-total-count="10902">HOLT: Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond to Senator Sanders.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="378" data-total-count="11280">CLINTON: Yes look, I have made it clear based on Senator Sanders’ own record that he has voted with the NRA, with the gun lobby numerous times. He voted against the Brady Bill five times. He voted for what we call, the Charleston Loophole. He voted for immunity from gunmakers and sellers which the NRA said, “was the most important piece of gun legislation in 20 years. “</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="262" data-total-count="11542">He voted to let guns go onto the Amtrak, guns go into National Parks. He voted against doing research to figure out how we can save lives. Let’s not forget what this is about, 90 people a day die from gun violence in our country. That’s 33,000 people a year.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="417" data-total-count="11959">One of the most horrific examples not a block from here where we had nine people murdered. Now, I am pleased to hear that Senator Sanders has reversed his position on immunity and I look forward to him joining with those members of congress who have already introduced legislation. There is no other industry in America that was given the total pass that the gun makers and dealers were and that needs to be reversed.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="310" data-total-count="12269">HOLT: All right, Governor O’Malley, you signed tough gun control measures as governor of Maryland and there are a lot Democrats in the audience here in South Carolina who own guns. This conversation might be worrying many of them. They may be hearing, “you want to take my guns. What would you say to them?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="1027" data-total-count="13296">O’MALLEY: This is what I would say Lester, look see, I’ve listened to Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders go back and forth on which of them has the most inconsistent record on gun safety legislation and I would have to agree with both of them. They’ve both been inconsistent when it comes to this issue.O’MALLEY: I’m the one candidate on this stage that actually brought people together to pass comprehensive gun safety legislation. This is very personal to me being from Baltimore. I will never forget one occasion visiting a little boy in Johns’ Hopkins Hospital, he was getting a birthday haircut, the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery and that boy’s head was pierced with a bullet. And I remember visiting him, it did not kill him - I remember visiting him and his mother in Johns Hopkins Hospital. He was getting a birthday haircut, the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery, and that boys head was pierced with a bullet.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="206" data-total-count="13502">And, I remember visiting him, it did not kill him.

Of course, as you mentioned, the church shootings. We won’t forget the video of Walter Scott being shot in the back while running from police.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="224" data-total-count="14450">We understand that a jury will decide whether that police officer was justified, but it plays straight to the fears of many African American men that their lives are cheap. Is that perception, or in your view, is it reality?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="306" data-total-count="14756">CLINTON: Well, sadly it’s reality, and it has been heartbreaking, and incredibly outraging to see the constant stories of young men like Walter Scott, as you said, who have been killed by police officers. Their needs to be a concerted effort to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="203" data-total-count="14959">And, that requires a very clear, agenda for retraining police officers, looking at ways to end racial profiling, finding more ways to really bring the disparities that stalk our country into high relief.</p><figure id="011716-4thdemdebate-liveblog-inline-article-promo-copy" class="interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-flex-medium">

How can you be the nominee if you don’t have that support?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="41" data-total-count="16654">SANDERS: Well, let me talk about polling.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="160" data-total-count="16814">(LAUGHTER) SANDERS: As Secretary Clinton well knows, when this campaign began she was 50 points ahead of me. We were all of three percentage points. Guess what?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="88" data-total-count="16902">In Iowa, New Hampshire, the race is very, very close.

We are running ahead of Secretary Clinton. In terms of taking on my taking on my good friend, Donald Trump, beating him by 19 points in New Hampshire, 13 points in the last national poll that we saw.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="370" data-total-count="17523">To answer your question. When the African American community becomes familiar with my Congressional record and with our agenda, and with our views on the economy, and criminal justice — just as the general population has become more supportive, so will the African American community, so will the Latino community.

And, here in South Carolina, “black lives matter” was the number one trending political issue.HOLT: Governor O’Malley, you’ve campaigned on your record as governor of Maryland, and before that, the mayor of Baltimore. Last year, of course, Baltimore was rocked by violent unrest in the wake of the death of Freddie Gray.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="212" data-total-count="18268">And right from the start of your campaign, you’ve been dogged by those who blame your tough-on-crime, so-called zero tolerance policies as mayor for contributing to that unrest. What responsibility do you bear?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="204" data-total-count="18472">O’MALLEY: Yes, let’s talk about this. When I ran for mayor in 1999, Lester, it was not because our city was doing well. It was because we were burying over 300 young, poor black men every single year.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="196" data-total-count="18668">And that’s why I ran, because, yes, black lives matter.

And many of these things are in the new agenda for criminal justice reform that I’ve put forward.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="211" data-total-count="19159">We created a civilian review board, gave them their own detectives.

It’s because we have a campaign finance system that is corrupt, we have super PACs, we have the pharmaceutical industry pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into campaign contributions and lobbying, and the private insurance companies as well.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="273" data-total-count="32219">What this is really about is not the rational way to go forward — it’s Medicare for all — it is whether we have the guts to stand up to the private insurance companies and all of their money, and the pharmaceutical industry.

This has been the fight of the Democratic Party for decades. We have the Affordable Care Act. Let’s make it work.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="200" data-total-count="33454">Let’s take the models that states are doing.

I will go anywhere, to meet with anyone, at any time to find common ground.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="254" data-total-count="34195">That’s what I did as a first lady, when I worked with both Democrats and Republicans to get the Children’s Health Insurance Program, when I worked with Tom DeLay, one of the most partisan of Republicans, to reform the adoption and foster care system.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="183" data-total-count="34378">What I did, working in the Senate, where I crossed the aisle often, working even with the senator from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, to get Tricare for national guardsmen and women.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="421" data-total-count="34799">And it’s what I did as Secretary of State, on numerous occasions, and most particularly, rounding up two-thirds votes in order to pass a treaty that lowered the nuclear weapons in both Russia and the United States. CLINTON: So I know it’s hard, but I also know you’ve got to work at it every single day. I look out here, I see a lot of my friends from the Congress. And I know that they work at it every single day.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="219" data-total-count="35018">Because maybe you can’t only find a little sliver of common ground to cooperate with somebody from the other party, but who knows. If you’re successful there, maybe you can build even more. That’s what I would do.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="47" data-total-count="35065">HOLT: That’s time.

In all do respect, you’re missing the main point. And the main point in the Congress, it’s not the Republicans and Democrats hate each other.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="150" data-total-count="35727">That’s a mythology from the media.

Demanding that the wealthy start paying their fair share of taxes.

So making community college free, making it possible to attend a public college or university with debt free tuition, looking for ways to protect our rights especially from the concerted Republican assault; on voting rights, on women’s rights, on gay rights, on civil rights, on workers rights.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="308" data-total-count="41147">And I know how much young people value their independence, their autonomy, and their rights.

They have too much economic power and they have too much financial power over our entire economy. If Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, the old Republican trust buster, what he would say is these guys are too powerful. Break them up. I believe that’s what the American people to want see. That’s my view.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="92" data-total-count="43544">HOLT: Secretary Clinton, help the voter understand the daylight between the two of you here.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="644" data-total-count="44188">CLINTON: Well, there’s no daylight on the basic premise that there should be no bank too big to fail and no individual too powerful to jail. We agree on that. But where we disagree is the comments that Senator Sanders has made that don’t just affect me, I can take that, but he’s criticized President Obama for taking donations from Wall Street, and President Obama has led our country out of the great recession. Senator Sanders called him weak, disappointing. He even, in 2011, publicly sought someone to run in a primary against President Obama.

So I’m going to defend Dodd-Frank and I’m going to defend President Obama for taking on Wall Street, taking on the financial industry and getting results.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="44484">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="28" data-total-count="44512">SANDERS: OK.

In 2006 when I ran for the Senate, Senator Barack Obama was kind enough to campaign for me, 2008, I did my best to see that he was elected and in 2012, I worked as hard as I could to see that he was reelected. He and I are friends. We’ve worked together on many issues. We have some differences of opinion.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="509" data-total-count="45397">But here is the issue, Secretary touched on it, can you really reform Wall Street when they are spending millions and millions of dollars on campaign contributions and when they are providing speaker fees to individuals? So it’s easy to say, well, I’m going to do this and do that, but I have doubts when people receive huge amounts of money from Wall Street. SANDERS: I am very proud, I do not have a super PAC.

Is that correct?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="474" data-total-count="54781">SANDERS: What is correct, and I’m disappointed that Secretary Clinton’s campaign has made this criticism. It’s a Republican criticism. Secretary Clinton does know a lot about healthcare, and she understands, I believe, that a medicare for all, single payer program will substantially lower the cost of healthcare for middle class families. So, what we have got to acknowledge, and I hope the Secretary does, is we are doing away with private health insurance premiums.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="354" data-total-count="55135">So, instead of paying $10,000 dollars to Blue Cross, or Blue Shield, yes, some middle class families would be paying slightly more in taxes, but the result would be that that middle class family would be saving some $5,000 dollars in healthcare costs. A little bit more in taxes, do away with private health insurance premiums.

Is that breaking your word?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="361" data-total-count="55849">SANDERS: No, it is not breaking my word. When you are — it’s one thing to say I’m raising taxes, it’s another thing to say that we are doing away with private health insurance premiums.SANDERS: So, if I save you $10,000 in private health insurance, and you pay a little bit more in taxes in total, there are huge savings in what your family is spending.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="117" data-total-count="55966">O’MALLEY: Senator, I’m the only person on this stage that’s actually balanced a budget every year for 15 years.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="57" data-total-count="56023">SANDERS: I was mayor for eight years, I did that as well.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="56033">(LAUGHTER)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="139" data-total-count="56172">O’MALLEY: OK.

Iran is getting it’s billions of dollars, several Americans who have been held are now going to be heading home. The president said today, “it’s a good day. It’s a good day for diplomacy. It’s a time now to restore diplomatic relations for the first time since 1979 and actually re- opened a U.S. Embassy in Tehran.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="331" data-total-count="63319">SANDERS: I think what we’ve got to do is move as aggressively as we can to normalize relations with Iran. Understanding that Iran’s behavior in so many ways is something that we disagree with; their support terrorism, the anti-American rhetoric that we’re hearing from of their leadership is something that is not acceptable.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="401" data-total-count="63720">On the other hand, the fact that we’ve managed to reach an agreement, something that I’ve very strongly supported that prevents Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and we did that without going to war. And that I believe we’re seeing a fall in our relationships with Iran is a very positive step. So if your question is, do I want to see that relationship become more positive in the future? Yes.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="237" data-total-count="63957">Can I tell that we should open an embassy in Tehran tomorrow? No, I don’t think we should. But I think the goal has go to be as we’ve done with Cuba, to move in warm relations with a very powerful and important country in this world.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="42" data-total-count="63999">MITCHELL: Your response Secretary Clinton?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="312" data-total-count="64311">CLINTON: Well, I’m very proud of the Iran Nuclear Agreement. I was very pleased to be part of what the president put into action when he took office. I was responsible for getting those sanctions imposed which put the pressure on Iran. It brought them to the negotiating table which resulted in this agreement.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="501" data-total-count="64812">And so, they have been so far, following their requirements under the agreement. But I think we still have to carefully watch them. We’ve had one good day over 36 year and I think we need more good days before we move more rapidly toward any kind of normalization. And we have to be sure that they are truly going to implement the agreement. And then, we have to go after them on a lot of their other bad behavior in the region which is causing enormous problems in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and elsewhere.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="341" data-total-count="65153">MITCHELL: You mentioned Syria. Let me ask you about Syria, all of you. Let’s turn to Syria and the civil war that has been raging there. Are there any circumstances in which you could see deploying significant numbers of ground forces in Syria, not just specials forces but significant ground forces to combat ISIS in a direct combat role?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="40" data-total-count="65193">Let me start with you Secretary Clinton.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="24" data-total-count="65217">CLINTON: Absolutely not.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="346" data-total-count="65563">I have a three point plan that does not include American Ground forces. It includes the United States leading an air coalition which is what we’re doing, supporting fighters on the ground; the Iraqi Army which is beginning to show more ability, the Sunni fighters that we are now helping to reconstitute and Kurdish on both sides of the border.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="432" data-total-count="65995">I think we also have try to disrupt their supply chain of foreign fighters and foreign money and we do have to contest them in online space. So I’m very committed to both going after ISIS but also supporting what Secretary Kerry is doing to try to move on a political diplomatic to try to begin to slow down and hopefully end the carnage in Syria which is the root of so many of the problems that we seen in the region and beyond.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="254" data-total-count="66249">MITCHELL: Senator Sanders, ground forces yes or no? SANDERS: As everybody you know, this is incredibly complicated and difficult issue and I applaud. I know President Obama’s been getting a lot of criticism on this. I think he is doing the right thing.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="325" data-total-count="66574">What the nightmare is, which many of my Republican colleagues appear to want is to not have learned the lesson of Iraq. To get American young men and women involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of Syria and the Middle East would be an unmitigated disaster that as president, I will do everything in my power to avoid.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="21" data-total-count="66595">O’MALLEY: Andrea...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="30" data-total-count="66625">MITCHELL: Governor O’Malley?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="379" data-total-count="67004">SANDERS: We should — we should learn — we should learn from King Abdullah of Jordan, one of the few heroes in a very unheroic place. And what Abdullah said is this is a war with a soul of Islam and that Muslim troops should be on the ground with our support and the support of other major countries. That is how we destroy ISIS, not with American troops in perpetual warfare.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="30" data-total-count="67034">MITCHELL: Governor O’Malley.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="22" data-total-count="67056">O’MALLEY: Thank you.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="67066">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="231" data-total-count="67297">Andrea, governors have led us to victory in two world wars by doing what America does best, and that is by joining forces with others by acting in coalition. And I believe that President Obama is doing the right thing in this case.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="390" data-total-count="67687">We need to learn the lessons from the past. We do need to provide the special — special ops advisers, we need — do need to provide the technical support, but over the long-term, we need to develop new alliances. We need a much more proactive national security strategy that reduces these threats before they rise to a level where it feels like we need to pull for a division of marines.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="538" data-total-count="68225">And I also want to add one other thing here. I appreciate the fact that in our debate, we don’t use the term you hear Republicans throwing around trying to look all vibrato (ph) and macho sending other kids — kids into combat, they keep using the term boots on the ground. A woman in Burlington, Iowa said to me, “Governor, when you’re with your colleagues, please don’t refer to my son who has served two tours of duty in Iraq as a pair of boots on the ground.” Now, we need to be mindful of learning the lessons of the past.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="68235">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="219" data-total-count="68454">MITCHELL: I have a question. I have a question for Senator Sanders. Did the policies of the Obama administration, in which Secretary Clinton of course was a part, create a vacuum in Iraq and Syria that helped ISIS grow?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="424" data-total-count="68878">SANDERS: No. I think the vacuum was created by the disastrous war in Iraq, which I vigorously opposed. Not only did I vote against it, I helped lead the opposition. And what happened there is yes, it’s easy to get rid of a two-bit dictator like Saddam Hussein, but there wasn’t the kind of thought as to what happens the day after you get him and what kind of political vacuum occurs. And who rises up? Groups like ISIS.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="311" data-total-count="69189">So I think that President Obama made a promise to the American people when he ran, and he said you know what, I’m going to do my best to bring American troops home. And I supported what he did. Our job is to train and provide military support for Muslim countries in the area who are prepared to take on ISIS.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="348" data-total-count="69537">And one point I want to make here that is not made very often, you have incredibly wealthy countries in that region, countries like Saudi Arabia, countries like Qatar. Qatar happens to be the largest — wealthiest country per capita in the world. They have got to start putting in some skin in the game and not just ask the United States to do it.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="69547">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="370" data-total-count="69917">MITCHELL: Secretary Clinton, I want to talk to you about red lines, because former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said in a recent interview that President Obama’s decision to stand down on planned missile strikes against Damascus after Assad had used chemical weapons hurt the president’s credibility. Should the president have stuck to his red line once he drew it?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="256" data-total-count="70173">CLINTON: Look, I think that the president’s decision to go after the chemical weapons once there was a potential opportunity to build on when the Russians opened that door resulted in a very positive outcome. We were able to get the chemical weapons out.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="353" data-total-count="70526">I know from my own experience as secretary of State that we were deeply worried about Assad’s forces using chemical weapons because it would have had not only a horrific affect on people in Syria, but it could very well have affected the surrounding states, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Turkey. So getting those chemical weapons out was a big deal, but...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="58" data-total-count="70584">MITCHELL: But should he — should he have stuck to his...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="32" data-total-count="70616">CLINTON: Well — but — but...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="268" data-total-count="70884">MITCHELL: ... line? Did it hurt U.S. credibility? CLINTON: I think, as commander in chief, you’ve got to constantly be evaluating the decisions you have to make. I know a little bit about this, having spent many hours in the situation room, advising President Obama.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="290" data-total-count="71174">And I want to just add to something that Senator Sanders said, the United States had a very big interest in trying to help stabilize the region. If there is any blame to be spread around, it starts with the prime minister of Iraq, who sectarianized his military, setting Shia against Sunni.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="232" data-total-count="71406">It is amplified by Assad, who has waged one of the bloodiest, most terrible attacks on his own people: 250,000-plus dead, millions fleeing. Causing this vacuum that has been filled unfortunately, by terrorist groups, including ISIS.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="282" data-total-count="71688">So, I think we are in the midst of great turmoil in this region.

But where I think we do have an honest disagreement, is that in the incredible quagmire of Syria, where it’s hard to know who’s fighting who and if you give arms to this guy, it may end up in ISIS’ hand the next day. We all know that.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="180" data-total-count="72554">And we all know, no argument, the secretary is absolutely right, Assad is a butcher of his own people, man using chemical weapons against his own people. This is beyond disgusting.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="230" data-total-count="72784">But I think in terms of our priorities in the region, our first priority must be the destruction of ISIS. Our second priority must be getting rid of Assad, through some political settlement, working with Iran, working with Russia.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="178" data-total-count="72962">But the immediate task is to bring all interests together who want to destroy ISIS, including Russia, including Iran, including our Muslim allies to make that the major priority.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="333" data-total-count="73295">O’MALLEY: But in all of that senator and secretary, I think we’re leaving out something very important here. And that is that we still don’t have the human intelligence: overt, in terms of diplomatic intelligence or covert, to understand even what the heck happens as the secondary and tertiary effects of some of these things.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="324" data-total-count="73619">We are walking through this region, Andrea, without the human intelligence that we need. And we need to make a renewed investment as a country in bringing up a new generation of foreign service officers, and bringing up a new generation of business people and actually understanding and having relationships in these places.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="158" data-total-count="73777">So we have a better sense of what the heck happens after a dictator topples and can take action to prevent another safe haven and another iteration of terror.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="34" data-total-count="73811">MITCHELL: Your time is us. Lester.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="386" data-total-count="74197">HOLT: Senator Sanders mentioned Russia a moment ago. Secretary Clinton, you famously handed Russia’s foreign minister a reset button in 2009. Since then, Russia has annexed Crimea, fomented a war in Ukraine, provided weapons that downed an airliner and launched operations, as we just did discuss, to support Assad in Syria. As president, would you hand Vladimir Putin a reset button?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="275" data-total-count="74472">CLINTON: Well, it would depend on what I got for it and I can tell you what we got in the first term, we got a new start treaty to reduce nuclear weapons between the United States and Russia. We got permission to resupply our troops in Afghanistan by traveling across Russia.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="273" data-total-count="74745">We got Russia to sign on to our sanctions against Iran and other very important commitments. So look, in diplomacy, you are always trying to see how you can figure out the interest of the other to see if there isn’t some way you can advance your security and your values.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="424" data-total-count="75169">When Putin came back in the fall of 2011, it was very clear he came back with a mission. And I began speaking out as soon as that happened because there were some fraudulent elections held, and Russians poured out into the streets to demand their freedom, and he cracked down. And in fact, accused me of fomenting it. So we now know that he has a mixed record to say the least and we have to figure out how to deal with him.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="113" data-total-count="75282">HOLT: What’s your relationship with him?CLINTON: Well, my relationship with him, it’s — it’s interesting.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="75292">(LAUGHTER)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="259" data-total-count="75551">It’s one, I think, of respect. We’ve had some very tough dealings with one another. And I know that he’s someone that you have to continuingly stand up to because, like many bullies, he is somebody who will take as much as he possibly can unless you do.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="288" data-total-count="75839">And we need to get the Europeans to be more willing to stand up, I was pleased they put sanctions on after Crimea and eastern Ukraine and the downing of the airliner, but we’ve got to be more united in preventing Putin from taking a more aggressive stance in Europe and the Middle East.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="75849">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="167" data-total-count="76016">HOLT: We to want turn right now to the issue of balancing national security concerns with the privacy rights of Americans. That brings us to YouTube and this question.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="18" data-total-count="76034">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="133" data-total-count="76167">BROWNLEE: Hi, my name Marques Brownlee, and I’ve been making YouTube videos about electronics and gadgets for the past seven years.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="225" data-total-count="76392">I think America’s future success is tied to getting all kinds of tech right. Tech companies are responsible for the encryption technology to protect personal data, but the government wants a back door into that information.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="105" data-total-count="76497">So do you think it’s possible to find common ground? And where do you stand on privacy versus security?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="16" data-total-count="76513">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="30" data-total-count="76543">HOLT: So, Governor O’Malley.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="22" data-total-count="76565">O’MALLEY: Thank you.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="231" data-total-count="76796">I believe whether it’s a back door or a front door that the American principle of law should still hold that our federal government should have to get a warrant, whether they want to come through the back door or your front door.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="76806">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="148" data-total-count="76954">And I also agree, Lester, with Benjamin Franklin, who said, no people should ever give up their privacy or their freedoms in a promise for security.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="198" data-total-count="77152">So we’re a collaborative people. We need collaborative leadership here with Silicon Valley and other bright people in my own state of Maryland and around the NSA that can actually figure this out.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="305" data-total-count="77457">But there are certain immutable principles that will not become antique things in our country so long as we defend our country and its values and its freedoms. And one of those things is our right to be secure in our homes, and our right to expect that our federal government should have to get a warrant.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="313" data-total-count="77770">I also want to the say that while we’ve made some progress on the Patriot Act, I do believe that we need an adversarial court system there. We need a public advocate. We need to develop jurisprudence so that we can develop a body of law that protects the privacy of Americans in the information and digital age.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="20" data-total-count="77790">HOLT: That’s time.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="291" data-total-count="78081">You have all talked about what you would do fighting ISIS over there, but we’ve been hit in this country by home-grown terrorists, from Chattanooga to San Bernardino, the recent shooting of a police officer in Philadelphia. How are you going to fight the lone wolves here, Senator Sanders?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="78" data-total-count="78159">O’MALLEY: Yes, Lester, year in and year out I was the leader of the U.S. ...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="76" data-total-count="78235">HOLT: That’s a question to Senator Sanders. I wasn’t clear, I apologize.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="247" data-total-count="78482">SANDERS: OK. I just wanted to add, in the previous question, I voted against the USA Patriot Act for many of the reasons that Governor O’Malley mentioned. But it is not only the government that we have to worry about, it is private corporations.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="213" data-total-count="78695">You would all be amazed, or maybe not, about the amount of information private companies and the government has in terms of the Web sites that you access, the products that you buy, where you are this very moment.</p><figure id="1click-FD" class="interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-small">

One — and I agree with what the secretary said, and what Governor O’Malley said. But here’s an issue that we also should talk about. We have a $600 billion military budget. It is a budget larger than the next eight countries’.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="317" data-total-count="82939">Unfortunately, much of that budget continues to fight the old Cold War with the Soviet Union.

Our belief in the dignity of every person, our belief in our own common good. There is now challenge that is too great for us to overcome provided we bring forward in these divided times, new leadership that can heal our divides here at home and bring our principles into alignment abroad.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="178" data-total-count="87825">We’re on the threshold of a new era of American progress and I believe we have only need to join forces together and cross that threshold into a new era of American prosperity.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="24" data-total-count="87849">HOLT: And that’s time.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="25" data-total-count="87874">O’MALLEY: Thanks a lot.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="24" data-total-count="87898">HOLT: Secretary Clinton?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="422" data-total-count="88320">CLINTON: Well Lester, I spent a lot of time last week being outraged by what’s happening in Flint, Michigan and I think every single American should be outraged. We’ve had a city in the United States of America where the population which is poor in many ways and majority African American has been drinking and bathing in lead contaminated water. And the governor of that state acted as though he didn’t really care.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="211" data-total-count="88531">He had request for help and he had basically stone walled. I’ll tell you what, if the kids in a rich suburb of Detroit had been drinking contaminated water and being bathed in it, there would’ve been action.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="277" data-total-count="88808">So I sent my top campaign aide down there to talk to the mayor of Flint to see what I could to help. I issued a statement about what we needed to do and then I went on a T.V. show and I said, “it was outrageous that the governor hadn’t acted and within two hours he had.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="24" data-total-count="88832">HOLT: And that’s time.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="140" data-total-count="88972">CLINTON: I want to be a president who takes care of the big problems and the problems that are affecting the people of our country everyday.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="88982">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="16" data-total-count="88998">HOLT: Thank you.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="16" data-total-count="89014">Senator Sanders?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="187" data-total-count="89201">SANDERS: Well, Secretary Clinton was right and what I did which I think is also right, is demanded the resignation of governor.

Let’s be honest and let’s be truthful. Very little is going to be done to transform our economy and to create the kind of middle class we need unless we end a corrupt campaign finance system which is undermining American democracy.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="428" data-total-count="89948">We’ve got to get rid of Super PACs, we’ve got to get rid of Citizens’ United and what we’ve got to do is create a political revolution which revitalizes American democracy; which brings millions of young people and working people into the political process. To say loudly and clearly,” that the government of the United States of America belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="153" data-total-count="90101">HOLT: All right.

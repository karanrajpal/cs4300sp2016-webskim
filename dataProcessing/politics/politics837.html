And if a candidate goes over the allotted time, you’ll hear this.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="268" data-total-count="1728">(BELL RINGS) So let’s get started. Candidates, jobs and growth — two of the biggest issues facing the country right now. In his State of the Union address earlier this week, the president said, quote, “we have the strongest, most durable economy in the world.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="221" data-total-count="1949">And according to our Facebook research, jobs is one of the biggest issues resonating across the country, including here in South Carolina. The president is touting 14 million new jobs and an unemployment rate cut in half.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="145" data-total-count="2094">The president said that anyone who claims America’s economy is in decline is peddling fiction.

President Obama’s preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei. And I’ll tell you, it was heartbreaking.</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs. And you know, he’s right. If you’re a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great. The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama. But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977. Median wages have stagnated. And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="137" data-total-count="3682">The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="26" data-total-count="3708">BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="3718">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="309" data-total-count="4027">CAVUTO: Governor Kasich, we are not even two weeks into this stock trading year, but (inaudible) investors already lost $1.6 trillion in market value.

And I’ve done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt. And our economy was growing like crazy. It’s the same thing that I did in Ohio. It’s a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety. It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way. And if you tax cuts — if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you’re going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the — in the world.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="341" data-total-count="5361">But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline. We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget. And when you do that, when you’re in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="351" data-total-count="5712">Right now, you don’t have the — you have taxes that are too high. You have regulations — I mean, come on, they’re affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses. They are — they’re in a position where they’re smothering people. And I mean, are you kidding me? We’re nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.</p><div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy. And how do I know it? Because I’ve done it. I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici. And I’ve done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="190" data-total-count="6263">Our wages are growing faster than the national average. We’re running surpluses.

Where and when should a president use military action to restore order?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="286" data-total-count="6973">CHRISTIE: Well, Maria, I’m glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what’s going on in the world. Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama. And I’ve got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="6983">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="298" data-total-count="7281">The fact is, there’s a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess. The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world. And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="290" data-total-count="7571">Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they’ve never said about me is that I’m misunderstood. And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we’re going to keep it.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="405" data-total-count="7976">Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience. And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he’s absolutely right. It’s a — it’s absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what’s going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.</p><div id="story-ad-4" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

We are not the world’s policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="328" data-total-count="9207">And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either. We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships. It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="9217">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="400" data-total-count="9617">CAVUTO: Governor Bush, the president just told the nation two nights ago that America is back and that the idea that our enemies are getting stronger or that this country is getting weaker, well, it’s just rhetoric and hot air. Now other Democrats go even further, sir, saying Republicans even suggesting such comments actually embolden our enemies. I guess they would include you. What do you say?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="242" data-total-count="9859">BUSH: Well first of all, the idea that somehow we’re better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe. The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="348" data-total-count="10207">Think about it. With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists. He’s missing the whole point, that America’s leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="144" data-total-count="10351">In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who’s the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.</p><div id="story-ad-5" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can’t even project force. Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we’re in a much difficult — we’re in a much different position than we should be.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="201" data-total-count="11025">And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well. Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="368" data-total-count="11393">As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military. We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world’s policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="11403">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="67" data-total-count="11470">CAVUTO: So I take it from that you do not agree with the president.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="112" data-total-count="11582">BUSH: No. And worse — worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="226" data-total-count="11808">Think about it.

You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="16387">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="484" data-total-count="16871">You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there’s a — the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow. They’re very, very badly wounded. They will — some will follow. And you look around, and you see what’s happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor — very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="367" data-total-count="17238">That could be the great Trojan Horse. It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction. When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women? It looked like very few women. Very few children. Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they’re saying what’s going on?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="439" data-total-count="17677">You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized — they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 — going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look — a good strong look and that’s what we have. We are nineteen trillion dollars — our country’s a mess and we can’t let all these people come into our country and break our borders. We can’t do it.</p><div id="story-ad-8" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

During your senate race, your campaign said, “it was inadvertent.” A million dollars is inadvertent?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="471" data-total-count="18416">CRUZ: Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times. You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don’t hide their views. The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, “Anybody But Cruz.” Had that actually — that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, “It Follows” that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="642" data-total-count="19058">So you know the New York Times and I don’t have exactly have the warmest of relationships. Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate — unlike Hillary Clinton, I don’t have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars. When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars. He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="492" data-total-count="19550">We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks. And the entire New York times attack — is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing. But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other. But if that’s the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.

We elected a president that doesn’t believe in the Constitution. He undermines it. We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.

When I’m president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.

So let’s set the facts straight. First of all, I didn’t support Sonia Sotomayor. Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="348" data-total-count="33510">Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban. I have vetoed a reduction this clip size. I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="316" data-total-count="33826">And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey. So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator. See when you’re a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk. And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you’re saying is accurate or not.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="120" data-total-count="33946">When you’re a governor, you’re held accountable for everything you do.

Sometimes it’s because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in — in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="335" data-total-count="37643">People are upset about it. I’ll tell you what else they’re upset about: you’re 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you’re out of work, and you don’t know where to go and where to turn. Do we have answer for that? We do. There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they’ve got great value.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="314" data-total-count="37957">I’ll tell you what else people are concerned about. Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can’t get a good job. We got to do a lot about the high cost of high — higher education, but we’ve got to make sure we’re training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="37967">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="234" data-total-count="38201">Let me tell you that, in this country — in this country, people are concerned about their economic future. They’re very concerned about it. And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to — keeping them from getting it.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="283" data-total-count="38484">That’s not the America that I’ve ever known. My father used to say, “Johnny, we never — we don’t hate the rich. We just want to be the rich.” And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="322" data-total-count="38806">And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America — and I mean everybody in America — having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="146" data-total-count="38952">I’m president — look, I’ve done it once.

And what do you think of the notion that Hillary Clinton is an enabler of sexual misconduct?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="343" data-total-count="39882">CARSON: Well, there’s not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they’re married to somebody who’s running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means. But you know, here’s the real issue, is this America anymore? Do we still have standards? Do we still have values and principles?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="336" data-total-count="40218">You know, you look at what’s going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society. You know, we have a war on virtual everything — race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars. Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other’s throat and our strength is actually in our unity.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="479" data-total-count="40697">You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section — you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names. Where did that spirit come from in America? It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that. And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong. And let’s not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="225" data-total-count="40922">The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.

Let’s get right back to the questions.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="397" data-total-count="41888">Governor Bush, gun rights, one of the top issues seen on Facebook with close to 3 million people talking about it in the past month. Right here in Charleston, Dylann Roof, who has been accused of killing nine people in a nearby church, reportedly had not passed his background check when he got his gun. What is the harm in tightening standards for not only who buys guns, but those who sell them?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="116" data-total-count="42004">BUSH: First of all, I’d like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the —</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="42014">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="183" data-total-count="42197">BUSH: The Emanuel AME church killings.

Look, here’s the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake. The law itself requires a background check, but that didn’t fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="288" data-total-count="42841">We don’t need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job. Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not — would not have passed a background check. The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="198" data-total-count="43039">That’s what they do, whether it’s the San Bernardino attack or if it’s these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is. It isn’t law-abiding gun owners.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="204" data-total-count="43243">Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you’re going away. You’re going away for a long, long while.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="280" data-total-count="43523">And that’s what we should focus on is the violence in our communities. Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you’re going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there’s a big divide.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="127" data-total-count="43650">The other issue is mental health. That’s a serious issue that we could work on.

Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don’t have access to guns.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="43980">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="26" data-total-count="44006">BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="109" data-total-count="44115">Mr. Trump, are there any circumstances that you think we should be limiting gun sales of any kind in America?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="189" data-total-count="44304">TRUMP: No. I am a 2nd amendment person. If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn’t have 14 or 15 people dead right now.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="189" data-total-count="44493">If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn’t have 130 people plus dead. So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="340" data-total-count="44833">We have a huge mental health problem in this country. We’re closing hospitals, we’re closing wards, we’re closing so many because the states want to save money. We have to get back into looking at what’s causing it. The guns don’t pull the trigger. It’s the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="44843">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="375" data-total-count="45218">TRUMP: We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order. He doesn’t want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress. You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation. He just writes out an executive order.

Yet under his presidency, gun sales have more than doubled. That doesn’t sound like a White House unfriendly to gun owners.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="90" data-total-count="45802">RUBIO: That sounds like people are afraid the president’s going to take their guns away.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="45812">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="491" data-total-count="46303">Look, the Second Amendment is not an option. It is not a suggestion. It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families. I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would. I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would. I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="120" data-total-count="46423">I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="385" data-total-count="46808">Here’s my second problem. None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he’s doing these things would have been preventive. You know why? Because criminals don’t buy their guns from a gun show. They don’t buy their guns from a collector. And they don’t buy their guns from a gun store. They get — they steal them. They get them on the black market.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="88" data-total-count="46896">And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.

If there’s an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control. Here’s a fact. We are in a war against ISIS. They are trying to attack us here in America. They attacked us in Philadelphia last week. They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago. And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="127" data-total-count="47453">When I’m president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="47463">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="171" data-total-count="47634">CAVUTO: But what fact can you point to, Senator — what fact can you point to that the president would take away everyone’s gun? You don’t think that’s (inaudible)?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="155" data-total-count="47789">RUBIO: About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can’t wait to restrict people’s access to guns.

Well, let me tell you this. Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, “These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion.” That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="91" data-total-count="48244">This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="48254">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="342" data-total-count="48596">He doesn’t meet — here’s the difference. When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it’s not “how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans.” It’s “give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns.” That will never happen when I am president of the United States.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="48606">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="475" data-total-count="49081">CAVUTO: Governor Christie, you, too, have criticized the president’s recent executive action on gun control, saying it’s unconstitutional, another step to bypass Congress. But hasn’t your own position on guns evolved, sir? The New Jersey Star-Ledger reports that you signed several laws to regulate the possession of firearms, and that you argued back in August 2013, and I quote, “These common sense measures will strengthen New Jersey’s already tough gun laws.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="59" data-total-count="49140">So isn’t that kind of what the president wants to do now?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="311" data-total-count="49451">CHRISTIE: No, absolutely not. The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people. And the fact is that that’s not a democracy. That’s a dictatorship. And we need to very, very concerned about that.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="303" data-total-count="49754">See, here’s the thing. I don’t think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident. I don’t think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat. I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="337" data-total-count="50091">The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit. We have made it easier to do that, not harder. And the way we’ve done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders. This guy is a petulant child.

We’re against your policies. When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate. You had only 21 Republican governors in this country. And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we’ve had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="211" data-total-count="50908">The American people have rejected your agenda and now you’re trying to go around it.

Your prosecute criminals. You target the bad guys. You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do — done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="280" data-total-count="51520">Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general. Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns. He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="286" data-total-count="51806">He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.

I was down there, and I’ve never seen anything like it.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="394" data-total-count="56224">And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death — nobody understood it. And it was with us for months, the smell, the air. And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.

The sailors were released, but only after shown on video apologizing for the incident. This occurring only weeks after Iran fired multiple rockets within 1,500 yards of a U.S. aircraft carrier and then continued to test medium range missiles.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="201" data-total-count="56881">Now you’ve claimed that such actions indicate Tehran has little to fear from a President Obama. I wonder, sir, what would change if they continued doing this sort of thing under a President Jeb Bush?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="250" data-total-count="57131">BUSH: Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military. Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy’s going to be cut again. It’s now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="432" data-total-count="57563">The deployments are too high for the military personnel. We don’t have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment. The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman. The planes are older than the pilots. We’re gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="116" data-total-count="57679">We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we’re back in the game.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="219" data-total-count="57898">Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.

The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak. This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran. We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="58552">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="419" data-total-count="58971">CAVUTO: Thank you, Governor. Governor Kasich, while everyone has been focusing on Iran’s provocations, I’m wondering what you make of what Saudi Arabia has been doing and its recent moves in the region, including its execution of a well-known Shi’ite cleric and its move to dramatically increase oil production, some say in an effort to drive down oil prices and force a lot of U.S. oil producers out of business.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="238" data-total-count="59209">Sure enough, oil prices have tumbled. One brokerage house is predicting a third or more of American oil producers and those heavily invested in fracking will go bankrupt, and soon Saudi Arabia and OPEC will be back in the driver’s seat.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="108" data-total-count="59317">U.S. energy player Harold Hamrie similarly told me with friends like these, who needs enemies?

I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina. Let em also tell you...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="59583">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="436" data-total-count="60019">... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense. And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems. So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="364" data-total-count="60383">With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it’s so critical for us to be energy independent, and we’re getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="122" data-total-count="60505">We’re seeing it in my state and we’ll see it in this country. And that’s why we must make sure we continue to frack.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="569" data-total-count="61074">In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they’re funding radical clerics through their madrasses. That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way. And I was going to tell you, whether I’m president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we’re going to support you, we’re in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you’ve got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="61084">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="282" data-total-count="61366">So look, in foreign policy — in foreign policy, it’s strength, but you’ve got to be cool.

You see what the Saudi’s — deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they’re going right with us. And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="61823">Thank you.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="23" data-total-count="61846">CAVUTO: Thank you John.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="132" data-total-count="61978">BARTIROMO: There’s much more ahead including the fight against ISIS.

Senator Graham has also said that the U.S. will find Arab support for its coalition if it removes Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

You think about it — this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state — drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we’re going to attack.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="170" data-total-count="65360">He used chemical weapons, he’s killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing. In fact, he’s done worse than nothing.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="321" data-total-count="65681">This president — and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer — she called Assad a reformer. Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="370" data-total-count="66051">We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad. The fact of the matter is we’re not going to have peace — we are not going to have peace in Syria. We’re not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don’t have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="101" data-total-count="66152">The Syrians should stay in Syria.

You’re simply not. And so Senator Graham is right about this.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="249" data-total-count="66542">And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="274" data-total-count="66816">And believe me, Assad is not worth it. And if you’re going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you’re going to give her another four years, that’s why I’m speaking out as strongly as I am about that.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="237" data-total-count="67053">Hillary Clinton cannot be president. It will lead to even greater war in this world. And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="179" data-total-count="67232">That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.

And I’ll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago. If we’re going to have a coalition, we’re going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.

You don’t know it, they tax us.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="436" data-total-count="82979">I have many friends that deal with China. They can’t — when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed. If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal — so we don’t have an equal playing field. I’m saying, absolutely, we don’t have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="207" data-total-count="83186">I’m a free trader.

It’s not fair trade.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="254" data-total-count="83809">KASICH: Neil, Neil — can I say one thing about this. I’m a free trader. I support NAFTA. I believe in the PTT because it’s important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China. And we do need China — Donald’s right about North Korea.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="323" data-total-count="84132">I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don’t proliferate all these dangerous materials. But what he’s touching — talking about, I think has got merit. And I’ll allow putting that tariff or whatever he’s saying here...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="41" data-total-count="84173">TRUMP: I’m happy to have him tonight...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="84183">(LAUGHTER)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="300" data-total-count="84483">KASICH: For too long — no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people’s jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us. And guess what? The worker’s out of a job.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="222" data-total-count="84705">So when they — be found against that country that’s selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?

How do I know this? Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn’t work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar. And the fact is those jobs are critical, they’re hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they’re Americans and they carry the load. So let’s demand open trade but fair trade in this country.

I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here’s why.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="255" data-total-count="85874">China doesn’t pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff. If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there’s a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="225" data-total-count="86099">So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="142" data-total-count="86241">It begins with tax reform.

This was a question on entitlements.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="36" data-total-count="103439">And the reason — and the reason...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="11" data-total-count="103450">(CROSSTALK)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="90" data-total-count="103540">CHRISTIE: ... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it. Here’s the thing.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="11" data-total-count="103551">(CROSSTALK)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="40" data-total-count="103591">CHRISTIE: The fact is, the reason why...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="56" data-total-count="103647">RUBIO: If you’ll answer the (inaudible) core question.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="396" data-total-count="104043">CHRISTIE: ... the fact is — the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it’s hard. It’s a hard problem. And I’m the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this — avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="256" data-total-count="104299">Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes. Bernie Sanders has already said it. And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she’s moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="256" data-total-count="104555">We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress — this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund. A Republican Congress did that.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="230" data-total-count="104785">And the fact is it was wrong. And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security. We need to reform Social Security. Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that’s why I’m answering your question.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="52" data-total-count="104837">BARTIROMO: Thank you, Governor. Thank you, Governor.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="262" data-total-count="105099">(APPLAUSE) CARSON: Can I just add one very quick thing? And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan. And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best. Just want to get that out there, just saying.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="33" data-total-count="105132">BARTIROMO: Thank you, Dr. Carson.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="298" data-total-count="105430">Coming up, how would the candidates protect America, and another terror attack, if we were to see it.

Are you planning on putting your assets in a blind trust should you become president? With such vast wealth, how difficult will it be for you to disentangle yourself from your business and your money and prioritize America’s interest first?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="221" data-total-count="106094">TRUMP: Well, it’s an interesting question because I’m very proud of my company. As you too know, I know I built a very great company. But if I become president, I couldn’t care less about my company. It’s peanuts.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="232" data-total-count="106326">I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again. I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there. Run the company kids, have a good time. I’m going to do it for America.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="45" data-total-count="106371">So I would — I would be willing to do that.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="56" data-total-count="106427">BARTIROMO: So you’ll put your assets in a blind trust?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="325" data-total-count="106752">TRUMP: I would put it in a blind trust. Well, I don’t know if it’s a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it. If that’s a blind trust, I don’t know. But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn’t ever be involved because I wouldn’t care about anything but our country, anything.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="25" data-total-count="106777">BARTIROMO: Thank you sir.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="17" data-total-count="106794">TRUMP: Thank you.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="617" data-total-count="107411">CAVUTO: Governor Christie, going back to your U.S. Attorney days, you had been praised by both parties as certainly a tough law and order guy. So I wonder what you make of recent statistics that showed violent crimes that have been spiking sometimes by double digit ratings in 30 cities across the country. Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn said, “most local law enforcement officials feel abandoned by Washington.” Former NYC Police Chief Ray Kelly, says that, “police are being less proactive because they’re being overly scrutinized and second guessed and they’re afraid of being sued or thrown in jail.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="47" data-total-count="107458">What would you do as president to address this?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="433" data-total-count="107891">CHRISTIE: Well, first off, let’s face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey. He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan. He said, “there’s a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country.” Here’s why, the president of the United States and both his attorney’s general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="281" data-total-count="108172">That’s the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president. Every time he’s got a chance, going all the way back to — remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time. This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="453" data-total-count="108625">Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey. I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here’s the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country. That’s where crime is happening in these cities where they don’t enforce the immigration laws. And this president turns his back — this president doesn’t enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn’t agree with them.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="529" data-total-count="109154">And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that’s illegal. This president allows lawlessness throughout this country. Here’s what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General. I’d say, “General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively. Make our streets safe again. Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="240" data-total-count="109394">We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well. I’m the only person on this stage who’s done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="27" data-total-count="109421">CAVUTO: Thank you governor.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="215" data-total-count="109636">Governor Kasich, as someone has to deal with controversial police shootings in your own state, what do you make of Chicago’s move recently to sort of retrain police? Maybe make them not so quick to use their guns?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="484" data-total-count="110120">KASICH: Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat. She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety. KASICH: And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.</p><figure id="1click-FD" class="interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-small">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="262" data-total-count="110382">KASICH: And they came back with 23 recommendations. One of them is a statewide use of deadly force. And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio. Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for — for training.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="254" data-total-count="110636">But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police. Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not — not to lose their life. Their family is waiting for them.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="163" data-total-count="110799">At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn’t work for them, but works against them.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="347" data-total-count="111146">See, in Ohio, we’ve had some controversial decisions. But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong. And it has been a remarkable situation in our state. And as president of the United States, it’s all about communication, folks. It’s all about getting people to listen to one another’s problems.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="455" data-total-count="111601">And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have. Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed. I’ve heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I’ve got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can’t do it alone. You’ve got to bring people together. You’ve got to give people hope.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="179" data-total-count="111780">And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America. And that is what’s so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="111790">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="28" data-total-count="111818">CAVUTO: Thank you, Governor.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="25" data-total-count="111843">BARTIROMO: Senator Rubio?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="111853">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="280" data-total-count="112133">Under current law, the U.S. is on track to issue more new permanent immigrants on green cards over the next five years than the entire population of South Carolina. The CBO says your 2013 immigration bill would have increased green cardholders by another 10 million over 10 years.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="121" data-total-count="112254">Why are you so interested in opening up borders to foreigners when American workers have a hard enough time finding work?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="277" data-total-count="112531">RUBIO: Well, first of all, this is an issue that’s been debated now for 30 years. And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who’s in this country, maybe they’re here illegally, but they’re looking for a job. This issue is not about that anymore.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="404" data-total-count="112935">First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe. And here’s why. There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system. And not just green cards. They’re looking — they’re recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances. They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="435" data-total-count="113370">They’re looking — they’re looking to manipulate our — the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States. So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States. So whether it’s green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I’m president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="40" data-total-count="113410">BARTIROMO: So your thinking has changed?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="422" data-total-count="113832">RUBIO: The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago. Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally. They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="431" data-total-count="114263">The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS. Because they’re recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees. We know this for a fact. They’ve contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border. And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="106" data-total-count="114369">This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I’m president we will.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="30" data-total-count="114399">BARTIROMO: Thank you, Senator.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="114409">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="441" data-total-count="114850">CRUZ: But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida. We had Boko Haram. We had Hamas. We had Hezbollah. We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America. It’s the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it’s clear now, that border security is national security.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="114860">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="30" data-total-count="114890">BARTIROMO: Thank you, Senator.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="259" data-total-count="115149">CRUZ: It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama’s power to let in Syrian refugees. It enabled him — the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="507" data-total-count="115656">I think that’s a mistake. That’s why I’ve been leading the fight to stop it. And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries. I voted yes to suspend that. Marco voted on the other side. So you don’t get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="541" data-total-count="116197">RUBIO: Maria, let me clear something up here. This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration. RUBIO: Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you’re against it. You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you’re against it. You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you’re against it. You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="302" data-total-count="116499">And by the way, it’s not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you’re against it. I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="116509">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="332" data-total-count="116841">That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation. When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant. Edward Snowden is a traitor. And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="116851">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="338" data-total-count="117189">And one more point, one more point. Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it. Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="168" data-total-count="117357">Here’s the bottom line, and I’ll close with this. If I’m president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="117367">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="39" data-total-count="117406">BUSH: There’s — look, there’s —</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="32" data-total-count="117438">CAVUTO: Gentlemen, gentlemen —</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="93" data-total-count="117531">CRUZ: I’m going to get a response to that, Neil. There’s no way he launches 11 attack —</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="175" data-total-count="117706">CAVUTO: Very quick, very quick. CRUZ: I’m going to — he had no fewer than 11 attacks there. I appreciate your dumping your (inaudible) research folder on the debate stage.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="30" data-total-count="117736">RUBIO: No, it’s your record.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="24" data-total-count="117760">CRUZL But I will say —</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="42" data-total-count="117802">CAVUTO: Do you think they like each other?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="96" data-total-count="117898">CRUZ: — at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false. They’re absolutely false.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="14" data-total-count="117912">AUDIENCE: Boo.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="388" data-total-count="118300">CRUZ: So let’s start — let’s start with immigration. Let’s start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity. Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty. I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King. Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals. I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="314" data-total-count="118614">And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion. What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it’s simply not true. And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="93" data-total-count="118707">CAVUTO: All right, gentlemen, we’ve got to stop. I know you are very passionate about that.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="118717">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="219" data-total-count="118936">Governor Bush, fears have gripped this country obviously, and you touched on it earlier since the San Bernardino attacks. Since our last debate, the national conversation has changed, according to Facebook data as well.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="471" data-total-count="119407">Now this first graphic shows the issues that were most talked about right before those attacks and now after: the issues of Islam, homeland security and ISIS now loom very large. The FBI says Islamic radicals are using social media to communicate and that it needs better access to communication. Now the CEO of Apple, Governor, Tim Cook said unless served with a warrant private communication is private, period. Do you agree, or would you try to convince him otherwise?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="277" data-total-count="119684">BUSH: I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators — back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="377" data-total-count="120061">The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country. We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff —</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="39" data-total-count="120100">CAVUTO: Would you answer this question?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="156" data-total-count="120256">BUSH: Oh, I’ll talk about that, too. But you haven’t asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I’d get that off my chest if you don’t mind.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="120266">(LAUGHTER)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="86" data-total-count="120352">CAVUTO: Fair enough. So Tim Cook — so Tim Cook says he’s going to keep it private.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="435" data-total-count="120787">BUSH: I got that. And the problem today is there’s no confidence in Washington, D.C. There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies. They understand that there’s a national security risk. We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they’re not fearful of a lawsuit.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="432" data-total-count="121219">We need to make sure that we keep the country safe. This is the first priority. The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely. Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is — that is just shameful. 23 million files in the hands of the Chinese? So it’s not just the government — the private sector companies, it’s also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="195" data-total-count="121414">We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well. That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="57" data-total-count="121471">CAVUTO: But if Tim cook is telling you no, Mr. President.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="227" data-total-count="121698">BUSH: You’ve got to keep asking. You’ve got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue. If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship —</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="284" data-total-count="121982">CAVUTO: Do you ask or do you order? BUSH: Well, if the law would change, yeah. But I think there has to be recognition that if we — if we are too punitive, then you’ll go to other — other technology companies outside the United States. And what we want to do is to control this.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="393" data-total-count="122375">We also want to dominate this from a commercial side. So there’s a lot of balanced interests. But the president leads in this regard. That’s what we need. We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you’re talking about amendments that don’t even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="28" data-total-count="122403">CAVUTO: Governor, thank you.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="122413">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="69" data-total-count="122482">BARTIROMO: When we come right back, closing statements.

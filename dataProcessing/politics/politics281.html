Before we begin as the candidates take their positions, I just want to set out some ground rules as moderators, I’ll ask questions, I’ll ask follow- ups and guide the discussion. The candidates will have one minute and 15 seconds to answer questions. They’ll have 30 seconds for follow- ups. CNN’s Don Lemon will join me in the questioning, as will members of our audience here tonight. The members of our audience are Democrats and independents from Flint and elsewhere in Michigan. We’ve reviewed their questions just so they don’t overlap.COOPER: Now we’ve come to Flint because this is a city in crisis, a city where, as you probably know, the tap water is toxic. Public servants, public institutions not only failed to prevent the crisis, their decisions created this crisis. The state of Michigan, in an effort to save money, switched Flint’s water source to a cheaper, but riskier alternative, the Flint River. Safeguards were ignored. That river water corroded residential pipes, and for nearly two years, lead leaked into the water used in people’s homes. Now, for much of that time, the state downplayed the danger, even in the face of growing complaints and physical evidence.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="229" data-total-count="3011">For 100 days, the federal government knew about it, and yet in all that time nobody told the people of Flint. They bathed in the water, they drank it, and so did their kids. Even today, lead is still present in some of the water.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="160" data-total-count="3171">Tonight the Democratic candidates are here to answer questions about what they would do for Flint, as well as about other issues facing their country right now.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="117" data-total-count="3288">Each candidate has one minute for an opening statement, Senator Sanders is first.

And, it was beyond belief that children in Flint, Michigan in the United States of America in the year 2016 are being poisoned.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="54" data-total-count="3706">That is clearly not what this country should be about.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="229" data-total-count="3935">As Anderson indicated, there’s a lot of blame to go around, and one of the points that I have made is that I believe the Governor of this state should understand that his dereliction of duty was irresponsible. He should resign.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="3945">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="666" data-total-count="4611"><strong>SANDERS:</strong> But more importantly, what is happening in Flint to a lesser degree is happening throughout this country. In recent years we have seen a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires, and increase in income and wealth inequality, and all over this country middle class families are struggling. Cities and towns are struggling, in order to provide basic services. Among many other things, we need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, our water systems, our waste water plants, our roads and our bridges. The wealthiest country in the history of the world has got to get its priorities right, take care of the people, no more tax breaks for billionaires.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="27" data-total-count="4638"><strong>COOPER:</strong> Thank you, Senator.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="4648">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="26" data-total-count="4674"><strong>COOPER:</strong> Secretary Clinton?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="51" data-total-count="4725"><strong>CLINTON:</strong> Well, I’ll start by saying amen to that.</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

We want to begin tonight with the people of Flint themselves. This is Mikki Wade, she’s a public housing program manager, and the mother of two kids. She says she’s currently undecided, and has a question that both of you will be able to weigh in on. Ms. Wade?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="469" data-total-count="6700"><strong>Q</strong>UESTION: The water has impacted our lives in such a way that living comfortably in our home isn’t the same anymore. The constant drives to pick up water just so my children can wash their hair, to wash our fruits and vegetables, and to brush our teeth is incredibly difficult. Once the pipes are replaced, I’m not so sure I would be comfortable ever drinking the water.QUESTION: If elected president, what course will you take to regain my trust in the government?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="50" data-total-count="6750"><strong>COOPER:</strong> Secretary Clinton, we’ll begin with you.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="49" data-total-count="6799"><strong>CLINTON:</strong> Well Nikki, it’s a very fair question.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="570" data-total-count="7369">Your government at all levels have let you and your children and the people of Flint down. So I think that there are there several things. All the repair work that is being done — and Mayor Weaver program that we support to begin to help train people in Flint to be able to do this work to distribute the water. Everything that is done has to be triple checked to regain your trust and to hold those who are responsible for fixing the pipes and delivering the clean water which has you said, you bathe in it and drink it and wash food in it. You do everything with it.</p><div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

So I will make sure as President that I double and triple check. I will work with elected officials who I trust like your mayor and like your senators and member of Congress so that we can assure you that when it’s fixed, you can trust it. You deserve nothing less.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="388" data-total-count="8193"><strong>COOPER:</strong> Secretary Clinton, let me follow-up with that, he people here still wasn’t drink the water in their homes as you well know. They can’t bathe their kids in the water and they are desperate for accountability and specifics. As president can you give a specific about what you can do if you were president that would make Ms. Wade’s life better and life better for people here?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="319" data-total-count="8512"><strong>CLINTON:</strong> Well, I support what President Obama is doing. He called for and got accountability from the officials at the EPA to make sure the state is doing its job. He expanded Medicaid for helping kids particularly to get the health care they need. He is also ordered that there be a Head Start program. I support that.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="554" data-total-count="9066">When it comes to the water itself, we are supporting a program that Mayor Waver announced through Flint Waterworks to pay people in Flint, not outsiders, but people here to deliver the water while we are fixing the pipes. I would do even more of that. As president, what we were able to put together was a beginning. As president, I would concentrate resources on the city for economic development for more jobs as we fix the water and provide the health and education, interventions that children need. COOPER: Senator Sanders for Ms. Wade specifically?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="296" data-total-count="9362"><strong>SANDERS:</strong> What is going is a disgrace beyond belief. As the president of the United States, this is what I would do is if local government does not have the resources — if state government for whatever reason America shouldn’t be poisoned, federal government comes in, federal government acts.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="9372">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="181" data-total-count="9553">What is absolute incredible to me is that water rates have soared in Flint. You are paying three times more for poison water than I am paying in Burlington, Vermont for clean water.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="94" data-total-count="9647">First thing is you say, people are not paying a water bill for poison and that is retroactive.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="9657">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="374" data-total-count="10031">Second of all, to ease anxiety, CDC has to come in and examine every child and adult in this community in terms of the amount of lead they may have. Thirdly, the wealthiest country has to rebuild the crumbling infrastructure, our water systems. I have a bill for a trillion dollars, it creates 13 million jobs rebuilding flint, Michigan and communities all over the country.</p><div id="story-ad-4" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

Previously, you had not called for that, but you’re calling for that tonight.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="338" data-total-count="11720">It’s easy to blame the Republican governor, Rick Snyder. But the federal government also dropped the ball here. According to Section 1414 of the Safe Drinking Water Act, the EPA has to step in and take action when a state is informed at (ph) — about water problems and doesn’t do anything for 30 days, as the state here didn’t do.</p><div id="story-ad-5" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

You’ve only both recently started talking about Flint, holding campaign events here in just the past few weeks. Secretary Clinton, you’ve even made the crisis a centerpiece of a new campaign ad. Why should the people of Flint believe that you aren’t just using this crisis to secure political points?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="340" data-total-count="18885"><strong>CLINTON:</strong> Well, I think because throughout my public career I have been evening the odds for people in every way that I could. I started out with the Children’s Defense Fund, I worked throughout my time as a young lawyer as a person, an activist. Certainly, in Arkansas, then in the White House, to try to fix problems wherever I saw them.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="86" data-total-count="18971">And, this problem is one that is particularly outrageous and painful at the same time.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="282" data-total-count="19253">So, when I heard about it I immediately sent people here to find out what was going on.

So, I have put together resources from the private and philanthropic communities to help provide a bridge because you’ve got to get the federal money, you’ve got to get the state money, but I’m going to do everything I can. And, I will be with Flint all the way through this crisis in whatever capacity I am.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="73" data-total-count="19875">And, if I’m president, it will always be a priority for action from me.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="19885">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="29" data-total-count="19914"><strong>COOPER:</strong> Bryn has a follow up.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="445" data-total-count="20359"><strong>Q</strong>UESTION: Senator Sanders, how about you?

Let me talk about the carrots. We’re going to have a very clear set of proposals and incentives for manufacturing so that we change the way that companies think about making investments again in America. I have a comprehensive manufacturing plan that I will be implementing.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="338" data-total-count="22666">We’re also going to invest more on infrastructure as we both have said, “it’s woefully under resourced.” That will put a lot of people to work. I want to do more to help small businesses, they are the source of two thirds of our jobs and we have to help them start and grow, particularly minority and women-owned small businesses.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="378" data-total-count="23044">We need to do more to help create clean energy as a source of good jobs but I am also going to go after companies. You know, when a company decides to leave like Nabisco is leaving and they have gotten tax benefits from Chicago and Illinois to stay there, I will claw back the benefits.

I went to Wall Street when I was a United States senator. I told them they were wrecking the economy. I asked for a moratorium on foreclosures. I asked that we do more to try to prevent what I worried was going to happen. I also called for closing loopholes including the carried interest loophole. I also called for changes in CEO pay. I have a record. And you know what, if you were going to be in some way distrusted or dismissed about whether you can take on Wall Street if you ever took money, President Obama took more money from Wall Street in the 2008 campaign than anybody ever had.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="154" data-total-count="31035">And when it came time to stand up to Wall Street, he passed and signed the toughest regulation since the Great Depression with the Dodd-Frank regulations.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="578" data-total-count="31613"><strong>COOPER:</strong> Senator Sanders, just yesterday, in fact, you said just — I believe it was yesterday you said not only her speech must have been a fantastic speech, it must have been a Shakespearean speech for that amount of money.

SANDERS: All right, look, Secretary Clinton wants everybody else to release it, well, I’m your Democratic opponent, I release it, here it is. There ain’t nothing.

And, I’ll tell you what else it did. It’s not only job loss by the millions, it is the race to the bottom so that new jobs in manufacturing, in some cases today, pay 50 percent less than they did 20 years ago. How stupid is that trade policy?</p><div id="story-ad-15" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

There had been a net increase of 653,000 jobs overall.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="222" data-total-count="35353">And, one of the ways jobs were brought to, and grown here in Michigan was through something called the Export-Import Bank which helped a lot of businesses, particularly small businesses, be able to export around the world.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="260" data-total-count="35613">Senator Sanders opposes that. I think we’re in a race for exports. I think China, Germany, everybody else supports their businesses. Here in Michigan there’s been $11 billion dollars in recent years used to support exports, primarily from small businesses.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="113" data-total-count="35726">I favor that, he’s opposed it. I want to do everything I can for us to compete and win in the global economy...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="30" data-total-count="35756"><strong>COOPER:</strong> ... Senator Sanders...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="56" data-total-count="35812"><strong>CLINTON:</strong> ... and that’s what I will do as president...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="153" data-total-count="35965"><strong>COOPER:</strong> ... I just want to explain to viewers what the Export- Import Bank is, in case everybody is not quite as wonkish as everybody on this stage here.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="281" data-total-count="36246">The Export-Import Bank, it’s a federal agency, it gives loans to companies that export American products. Senator Sanders, you do oppose it. The vast majority of the bank’s customers are small businesses, 176 right here in Michigan. What do you say to small business owners....</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="42" data-total-count="36288"><strong>SANDERS:</strong> ... I’ll tell you what I say...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="69" data-total-count="36357"><strong>COOPER:</strong> ... Who rely on the banks to make their company profitable...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="258" data-total-count="36615"><strong>SANDERS:</strong> ... I’ll tell you what I say. Do you know what the other name of the Export-Import Bank is? What it’s called in Washington? It’s called the bank of Boeing because Boeing itself gets 40 percent of the money discharged by the Export-Import Bank.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="231" data-total-count="36846">Seventy-Five percent of the funds going from the federal government, the Export-Import Bank, goes to large, profitable corporations. Many of these corporations have shut down in America, and have gone abroad to exploit poor people.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="193" data-total-count="37039">You know what? I don’t think it’s a great idea for the American taxpayer to have to subsidize through corporate welfare profitable corporations who downsize in the United States of America.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="18" data-total-count="37057"><strong>COOPER:</strong> Senator...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="86" data-total-count="37143"><strong>SANDERS:</strong> ... Seventy-Five percent of that money goes to large profitable corporations.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="183" data-total-count="37326"><strong>COOPER:</strong> Senator Sanders, you are the only member of the Democratic caucus to vote against it. You’re agreeing with Senator Ted Cruz on this, why is he right and the Democrats wrong?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="69" data-total-count="37395"><strong>SANDERS:</strong> Well, let me tell you, I don’t want to break the bad news.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="37405">(LAUGHTER)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="102" data-total-count="37507"><strong>SANDERS:</strong> Democrats are not always right. Democrats have often supported corporate welfare...(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="426" data-total-count="37933"><strong>SANDERS:</strong> Democrats have supported disastrous trade agreements, but on this issue I do not believe in corporate welfare, and in fact, secretary Clinton may know or not know, but as a member of the Financial Services Committee, I worked hard and successfully to make sure that at least 20 percent of the money went to small businesses which is where it should go and not to profitable corporations and downsizing in our country.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="26" data-total-count="37959"><strong>COOPER:</strong> Secretary Clinton?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="528" data-total-count="38487"><strong>CLINTON:</strong> When I traveled around the world on you behalf as Secretary of State and went to 112 countries, one thing I saw everywhere was how European and Asian countries were supporting their companies back in their countries, to be able to make sales and contracts in a lot of the rest of the world. In fact, without the export-import bank, supporting businesses of all sizes — I believe more jobs would be lost here at home and more jobs literally would be exported. Instead of exporting products, we would be exporting jobs.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="260" data-total-count="38747">I just believe that Senator Sanders took that lonely position because most of us who saw the results — I saw it as a senator from New York. Your Senators saw it here in Michigan. They can give you the names of 240 companies in Michigan that have been helped.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="271" data-total-count="39018">There is a company in Levonia being helped, there are companies all over this state. I know, if we are going to compete and win in the global economy, we can’t let every other country support their companies and we take a hands off approach. I will not agree with that.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="210" data-total-count="39228"><strong>COOPER:</strong> I’m going to let you respond but I just want to push back on this. Senator Sanders is correct, the majority of the money does go Boeing, does go to companies like Caterpillar. Do they need this money?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="337" data-total-count="39565"><strong>CLINTON:</strong> I will tell you what, Anderson, after I investigated it, I concluded they did and here’s why. There two big plane manufacturers in the world, there’s Airbus and Boeing. Airbus does everything it can to get contracts to sell planes everywhere in the world. We don’t have as quite an aggressive outreach from our government.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="355" data-total-count="39920">I did go in many places around the world to sell American products because the alternatives were usually European, Asian, primarily Chinese products. That to me was an unacceptable concession. So yes, Boeing and other big companies get support just like their competitors do from the companies that they are from in the countries that provide the support.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="18" data-total-count="39938"><strong>COOPER:</strong> Thank you.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="16" data-total-count="39954">Senator sanders?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="248" data-total-count="40202"><strong>SANDERS:</strong> Isn’t it tragic that the large multinational corporations making billions of dollars a year, shutting down in America, going to China, going to Mexico? Absolutely they need a handout from the American middle class — I don’t think so.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="14" data-total-count="40216">Second of all.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="40226">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="364" data-total-count="40590">Second of all, secretary Clinton traveled the world, she has been to Europe. And let’s talk about Europe versus the United States. I’m sure that when you were in Europe, and France, and Germany and the U.K., and all of the other countries; you noticed something and that is every one of those countries guarantees health care to all of their people as a right.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="40600">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="430" data-total-count="41030">And I am sure you know as you know you do that in countries like the U.K. compared to America, we are spending almost three times as much as they spend in the U.K. for health care for our people. We are spending 50 percent more than the French. When we talk about Europe and their pluses and minuses, one thing they have done well that we should emulate and that is guaranteed health care for all people for a better care for all.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="120" data-total-count="41150"><strong>COOPER:</strong> Thank you, Senator Sanders. Secretary Clinton, 30 seconds and we have to take a break. So 30 seconds if you can.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="224" data-total-count="41374"><strong>CLINTON:</strong> We are on the path to doing that thanks to President Obama and the Affordable Care Act, we have 90 percent coverage. We are lacking 10 percent. We are going to stay on that and get to 100 percent universal coverage.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="219" data-total-count="41593"><strong>COOPER:</strong> We have to take a break. We will continue this discussion. We have a lot more to talk about. We will take a short break. We have more of the Presidential Democratic Debate from Flint, Michigan when we come back.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="18" data-total-count="41611">(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="184" data-total-count="41795"><strong>COOPER:</strong> And welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential debate, live here in Flint, Michigan. We want to continue the discussion now — we’re gonna turn to the subject of crime.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="179" data-total-count="41974">As most of you know, two weeks ago, an Uber driver in Kalamazoo, which is two hours from where we are tonight, went on a shooting rampage, killing six people, injuring two people.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="239" data-total-count="42213">One of the injured was a 14-year-old girl. Her name is Abigail Kopf. She was shot in the head, her heart stopped, she was on life support — looked like she might — might not make it. But amazingly, Abigail pulled through. Her father...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="42223">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="164" data-total-count="42387">... her father Gene Kopf is here tonight. And I know, Gene, you have a question. But before you ask your question, I just want to ask, how is Abigail doing tonight?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="89" data-total-count="42476"><strong>Q</strong>UESTION: She is now laughing and giggling, but she has a long road of physical recovery.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="42486">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="198" data-total-count="42684"><strong>COOPER:</strong> I should point out you are leaning toward Senator Sanders, but I know you have a question that applies to both candidates. We’ll first toss it to Secretary Clinton. What’s your question?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="260" data-total-count="42944"><strong>Q</strong>UESTION: The United States has had a rash of mass shootings over the years — 42 shootings in the United States this year alone. The man who shot everyone, including my daughter, in Kalamazoo, had no mental health issues recorded, and had a clear background.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="189" data-total-count="43133">What do you plan to do to address this serious epidemic? I don’t want to hear anything about tougher laws for mental health or criminal backgrounds, because that doesn’t work.(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="26" data-total-count="43159"><strong>COOPER:</strong> Secretary Clinton?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="252" data-total-count="43411"><strong>CLINTON:</strong> Well, first of all I am looking at your daughter and I’m very grateful that she is laughing and she is on a road to recovery. But it never should have happened. You know, on average, 90 people a day are killed by gun violence in our country.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="368" data-total-count="43779">I think we have to try everything that works to try to limit the numbers of people and the kinds of people who are given access to firearms. The Brady Bill, which has been in effect now for about 23 years, has kept more than two million purchases from going forward. So we do have to continue to try to work on that because not every killer will have the same profile.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="405" data-total-count="44184">But the comprehensive background checks, closing the gun show loophole, closing the online loophole, closing what’s called the Charleston loophole, where you get a gun at the end of three days, even if the background check is not completed which is what the killer in Charleston did. And then they found out later, he shouldn’t have gotten the gun when he killed nine people at Mother Emmanuel Church.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="108" data-total-count="44292">I also believe, so strongly Gene (ph), that giving immunity to gunmakers and sellers was a terrible mistake.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="44302">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="555" data-total-count="44857"><strong>CLINTON:</strong> Because it removed any accountability from the makers and the sellers. And it also disrupted what was a very promising legal theory, to try to get makers to do more to make guns safer for example. To try to give sellers more accountability for selling guns when they shouldn’t have. So that is an issue that Senator Sanders and I differ on, I voted against giving them immunity, but I think we should very seriously move to repeal that and go back to making sure gun makers and sellers are like any other business. They can be held accountable.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="51" data-total-count="44908">And then I do think we have got to have a public...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="20" data-total-count="44928"><strong>Q</strong>UESTION: Thank you.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="133" data-total-count="45061"><strong>CLINTON:</strong> Well, we’ve got to have a public discussion, because we have created a culture in which people grab for guns all the time.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="180" data-total-count="45241"><strong>COOPER:</strong> Thank you. CLINTON: And there has got to be a way to have more warning signals and more efforts to try to stop that from happening like with the man who shot your daughter.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="40" data-total-count="45281"><strong>COOPER:</strong> I want to go to Senator Sanders.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="45291">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="24" data-total-count="45315"><strong>COOPER:</strong> Senator Sanders?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="420" data-total-count="45735"><strong>SANDERS:</strong> I remember President Obama being on television maybe three months ago. Showed the secretary members as well. She knows the president, I know the president. And he is generally speaking in public and he’s not a very emotional guy. And he — after the mass killing in Oregon if my memory is correct, he said look. There — to be honest with you, let’s be honest. Nobody has a magic solution to this problem.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="342" data-total-count="46077">Any lunatic tomorrow, any person can walk into a theater and do something horrific. And you know what? For us to tell you that that absolutely will not happen would be untrue. But what the president said, he said look, this is a tough issue. But we have got to do everything we possibly can to minimize the possibility of these mass killings.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="384" data-total-count="46461">You are looking at a guy who comes from a rural state with no gun control. I have a D minus voting record from the NRA. You are looking at a guy who in 1988 lost a statewide election for Congress because I was the only candidate who said you know what, I don’t think it’s a great idea in this country to be selling military-style assault weapons which are designed to kill people.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="46471">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="245" data-total-count="46716"><strong>SANDERS:</strong> I lost that election by three votes.

If you go to a gun store and you legally purchase a gun, and then, three days later, if you go out and start killing people, is the point of this lawsuit to hold the gun shop owner or the manufacturer of that gun liable?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="321" data-total-count="48968">If that is the point, I have to tell you I disagree.

And, one of those problems was, unfortunately, a move to expand the reasons why people would be incarcerated, not just at the federal level which is what this bill about, but in states and localities as well. And, that’s why the very first speech that I gave in this campaign was about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration because I believe absolutely that too many families were broken up, too many communities were adversely affected.

He said at the NAACP that there were some aspects that worked well. The violence against women provisions have worked well, for example. But, other aspects of it were a mistake and I agree. That’s why I’m focused, and have a very comprehensive approach toward fixing the criminal justice system, going after systemic racism that stalks the criminal justice system, ending private prisons, ending the incarceration of low-level offenders, and I am committed to doing that.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="55943">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="298" data-total-count="56241"><strong>LEMON:</strong> And, Senator Sanders, before you respond, I want to ask you this. Back in 1994, here’s what you warned, we are dooming tens of millions of young people to a future of bitterness, mystery, hopelessness, drugs, crime, and violence, but you voted for the bill anyway. Was your vote a mistake?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="212" data-total-count="56453"><strong>SANDERS:</strong> You know, as I think Secretary Clinton knows, as we all know, there are bills in congress that have bad stuff, there are bills in congress that have good stuff.

When I was a young man at the University of Chicago, I worked with fellow black and white students trying to desegregate the University of Chicago owned housing. Most candidates for president, don’t put this on their resume, but I was arrested by the Chicago police for trying to desegregate the Chicago school system.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="58737">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="710" data-total-count="59447">In 1963, and an important day for me, I went to the march on Washington led by Dr. King for jobs and freedom. Dr. King has been an important inspiration for me. In this campaign, if you go to<a href="http://berniesanders.com/"><strong>berniesanders.com</strong></a> and read our position on criminal justice, it is I believe the strongest position of any candidate. What it says among other things, 51 percent of African-American kids today are unemployed — you know we’re going to do? We’re going to provide education and jobs for those kids, not jails or incarceration.

It was also important for me to be a baby-sitter for the children of migrant workers and to learn more about their lives, and to hear Dr. King speak in Chicago when I was about 14 years old. That got me thinking about what I needed to do to try to fulfill my faith.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="443" data-total-count="60498">When I was in law school, I had the opportunity to mead a visionary woman, named Mary Right Adelman, who worked with Dr. King who was the first African-American woman who passed the Mississippi bar. I asked her for a job and she said she didn’t have any money. I was working my way through law school and she said if I could get a job and get myself paid, she would give me a job. So I got law students a Civil Rights Research Council Grant.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="488" data-total-count="60986">The first thing she did was send me to look at South Carolina, to investigate juveniles being sent to adult jails. The second thing she did was to send me to Alabama to investigate segregated academies. So from that moment until today, I am so grateful for my experiences as a very young woman driven by my church and my experiences working for the Children’s Defense Fund which have given me some insight and have lit a fire inside me to do everything I can to address systemic racism.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="847" data-total-count="61833"><strong>LEMON:</strong> I want to ask both of you this question.

Secretary, you first.CLINTON: Well, Don, if I could, I think being a white person in the United States of America, I know that I have never had the experience that so many people, the people in this audience have had. And I think it’s incumbent upon me and what I have been trying to talk about during this campaign is to urge white people to think about what it is like to have “the talk” with your kids, scared that your sons or daughters, even, could get in trouble for no good reason whatsoever like Sandra Bland and end up dead in a jail in Texas.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="61843">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="571" data-total-count="62414"><strong>CLINTON:</strong> And I have spent a lot of time with the mothers of African-American children who have lost them, Trayvon Martin’s mother.

When I was in one of my first years in Congress, I went to a meeting downtown in Washington, D.C. And I went there with another congressman, an African-American congressman. And then we kind of separated during the meeting. And then I saw him out later on. And he was sitting there waiting and I said, well, let’s go out and get a cab. How come you didn’t go out and get a cab?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="795" data-total-count="63859">He said, no, I don’t get cabs in Washington, D.C. This was 20 years ago. Because he was humiliated by the fact that cabdrivers would go past him because he was black. I couldn’t believe, you know, you just sit there and you say, this man did not take a cab 20 years ago in Washington, D.C. Tell you another story, I was with young people active in the Black Lives Matter movement. A young lady comes up to me and she says, you don’t understand what police do in certain black communities. You don’t understand the degree to which we are terrorized, and I’m not just talking about the horrible shootings that we have seen, which have got to end and we’ve got to hold police officers accountable, I’m just talking about every day activities where police officers are bullying people.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="333" data-total-count="64192">So to answer your question, I would say, and I think it’s similar to what the secretary said, when you’re white, you don’t know what it’s like to be living in a ghetto. You don’t know what it’s like to be poor. You don’t know what it’s like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="162" data-total-count="64354">And I believe that as a nation in the year 2016, we must be firm in making it clear.

You have said they would absolutely be better under a Sanders presidency.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="89" data-total-count="64681">So how would you be more effective in tackling racial issues than President Barack Obama?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="165" data-total-count="64846"><strong>SANDERS:</strong> It’s not a question of being better than President Obama, it is a question of building on the work that President Obama has done, the very important work.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="64856">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="55" data-total-count="64911"><strong>LEMON:</strong> You said “absolutely,” though, in an answer.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="130" data-total-count="65041"><strong>SANDERS:</strong> No, well, he has given us a good, good basis and foundation. We have got to do better than that. And of course we should.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="248" data-total-count="65289">But here’s what I would do. I would end — I would make sure that the Department of Justice investigated every killing of a citizen of this country when they are under apprehension from a police officer or when they are killed in police custody.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="59" data-total-count="65348">I would end the militarization of local police departments.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="65358">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="272" data-total-count="65630"><strong>SANDERS:</strong> I would develop model programs to make police departments look like the communities that they serve. I would end minimal sentencing and give judges more discretion. I would recognize that substance abuse and drug addiction is a health issue, not a criminal issue.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="65640">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="201" data-total-count="65841"><strong>SANDERS:</strong> And I would make sure that those people who left jail had the education and job training so they don’t go back into the same environment which got them in jail in the first place. (APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="36" data-total-count="65877"><strong>LEMON:</strong> Senator, thank you very much.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="169" data-total-count="66046">Secretary Clinton, in 1996, you used the term super predators to describe some young kids. Some feel like it was racial code. Was it and were you wrong to use that term?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="240" data-total-count="66286"><strong>CLINTON:</strong> Well, I was speaking about drug cartels and criminal activity that was very concerning to folks across the country. I think it was a poor choice of words, I never used it before, I haven’t used it since, I would not use it again.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="248" data-total-count="66534">Because my whole life, to go back to what I was saying to Mr. Mcgee (ph), is, you know, really, ever since I went to work for the Children’s Defense Fund, is to try to figure out ways to even the odds for people that are left out and left behind.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="345" data-total-count="66879">And I know very well that we have too many kids in our country right now who are living in poverty, who are going to schools like the ones in Detroit that have mold and rodents in them. I saw that in South Carolina. It’s unfortunately across America. So what we have got to do is provide more opportunities earlier in the lives of every child.</p><figure id="0306liveblogarticle600pxpromo" class="interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-flex-medium">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="384" data-total-count="67263">That’s why I believe in supporting families, early childhood education, universal pre-kindergarten, help kids be successful. And here is Flint, we’ve got to do more to mitigate against the effects of lead, because too many kids are having the experiences I’ve been told about, where they’re falling back in school, where they are having headaches because of the lead exposure.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="17" data-total-count="67280"><strong>LEMON:</strong> Thank you.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="95" data-total-count="67375"><strong>CLINTON:</strong> So we’re going to have to do even more here than we would do in most other counties.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="62" data-total-count="67437"><strong>LEMON:</strong> We’re going to talk about education in just a moment.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="43" data-total-count="67480"><strong>SANDERS:</strong> But can I respond to that briefly?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="18" data-total-count="67498"><strong>COOPER:</strong> We’re...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="126" data-total-count="67624"><strong>SANDERS:</strong> Just in this. I am not sure which legislation that was. But I think it may have been the Welfare Reform, so-called...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="35" data-total-count="67659"><strong>CLINTON:</strong> No, it was the crime bill.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="35" data-total-count="67694"><strong>SANDERS:</strong> Oh, it was the crime bill.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="20" data-total-count="67714"><strong>CLINTON:</strong> Crime bill.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="302" data-total-count="68016"><strong>SANDERS:</strong> But during that same period, ’96. There was a bill called — so-called, it had a long title to it, Welfare Reform Bill. And this bill really was a bill that scapegoated the poorest people in this country. I strongly opposed that legislation. Secretary Clinton had a different position then.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="211" data-total-count="68227">And what that legislation ended up doing is increasing extreme poverty, the poorest people in this country have become much poorer as a result of that — really a bill that was written by Republicans. Bad bill.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="64" data-total-count="68291"><strong>LEMON:</strong> Thank you. Secretary Clinton, you were in, so 30 seconds.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="423" data-total-count="68714"><strong>CLINTON:</strong> Well, once again, if we’re going to argue about the ’90s, let’s try to get the facts straight. That bill had a lot of provisions that unfortunately were stripped out by George W. Bush, by Republican governors. And I disagreed with the way it was applied. And I have a very clear set of ideas about what should be done to try to provide more support, including trying to cut poverty in half in the next years.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="279" data-total-count="68993">But if we are going to talk about the ’90s, let’s talk about 23 million new jobs, incomes went up for everybody. The median African- American income went up 33 percent at the end of the ’90s and we lifted more people out of poverty than at any other time in recent history.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="56" data-total-count="69049">So we were on the right path. More jobs, rising incomes.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="23" data-total-count="69072"><strong>LEMON:</strong> Senator Sanders.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="173" data-total-count="69245"><strong>CLINTON:</strong> Along came George W. Bush and trickle down economics and brought us the Great Recession, which thank goodness President Obama has been digging us out of ever since.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="23" data-total-count="69268"><strong>LEMON:</strong> Senator Sanders.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="69278">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="275" data-total-count="69553"><strong>SANDERS:</strong> Secretary Clinton is right. In the 1990s, we created a whole lot of jobs. Good. And I supported many of your husband’s initiatives. But in the 1990s, you know what we also did? We deregulated Wall Street, which allowed Wall Street to end up destroying our economy.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="69563">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="284" data-total-count="69847">We passed NAFTA and other disastrous trade agreements which had a horrendous impact on African-Americans in particular, in Flint, in Detroit and all across this country. So when we talk about the ’90s, you’re right. A lot of good things happened, but a lot of bad things happened.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="25" data-total-count="69872"><strong>LEMON:</strong> Thank you Senator.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="48" data-total-count="69920"><strong>SANDERS:</strong> I voted against those trade agreements.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="25" data-total-count="69945"><strong>LEMON:</strong> Thank you Senator.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="54" data-total-count="69999"><strong>SANDERS:</strong> And I voted against Wall Street deregulation.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="169" data-total-count="70168"><strong>COOPER:</strong> Thank you Senator. We have to take a short break. The Democratic presidential discussion and debate continues here from Flint in just a moment.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="168" data-total-count="70336"><strong>COOPER:</strong> And welcome back. Welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential debate, here live in Flint, Michigan. Let’s — let’s move on to the subject of education.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="187" data-total-count="70523">In nearby Detroit, the public schools have become a national symbol of neglect and failure. That school system is $3.5 billion in debt. Officials say they could run out of money by April.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="238" data-total-count="70761">I want to bring in Shoniqua Kemp. She’s right here — Ms. Kemp. Her 14-year-old daughter Imani is a student in Detroit. Shoniqua is one of ten parents suing Detroit public schools — not for money, she says, but to improve conditions.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="146" data-total-count="70907">She says she’s currently leaning towards Senator Sanders. Her question will go to both of you, but we’ll start with Senator Sanders. Ms. Kemp?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="185" data-total-count="71092"><strong>Q</strong>UESTION: Thank you. Speaking of opportunities for success, in Detroit, schools open and close with no accountability to — or transparency to the communities that it — they service.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="675" data-total-count="71767">Not only that — in our schools, as you’ve stated, we have issues with rats, mold, no working water fountains, not to mention non- certified teachers, lack of accountability around transportation and special education, and so much more.QUESTION: With that said, our students can no longer suffer due to lack of these things, or having these dilapidated issues take place. So, my question is who’s going to step up? Who’s going to ensure that the policies procedures are put in place that will ensure, and bring forth a successful future for our students because my daughter cannot wait eight more years for success to take place at your hands. At the leader’s hands.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="48" data-total-count="71815"><strong>COOPER:</strong> Senator Sanders, let’s start with you.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="136" data-total-count="71951"><strong>SANDERS:</strong> Well, thank you very much for not being resigned to that horrendous situation, but being prepared to stand up and fight back...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="26" data-total-count="71977"><strong>Q</strong>UESTION: ... Thank you...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="71987">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="57" data-total-count="72044"><strong>SANDERS:</strong> ... That’s what we need all over this country.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="277" data-total-count="72321">And, let me be very honest with you, hard thing to say, but it is true. A great nation is judged not by how many millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how it treats the most vulnerable amongst us, and that is the children, and that is the elderly. And, do you know what?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="70" data-total-count="72391">We should be ashamed of how we treat our kids and our senior citizens.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="20" data-total-count="72411"><strong>Q</strong>UESTION: Thank you.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="72421">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="326" data-total-count="72747"><strong>SANDERS:</strong> We have a Republican leadership in congress now fighting for hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the top two-tenths of one percent, but somehow we can’t come up with the money to fix Detroit’s crumbling public school system. Somehow we cannot make sure that Detroit has qualified, and good teachers.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="331" data-total-count="73078">Somehow we can’t make sure that there are summer programs for your children, and after school programs for your children. Somehow we cannot do what other countries around the world, is provide quality childcare and pre-K. We have got to change our national priorities, no more tax breaks for billionaires, and large corporations.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="92" data-total-count="73170">We are going to invest in our children, and have the best public school system in the world.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="347" data-total-count="73517"><strong>COOPER:</strong> Senator Sanders, before we go to Secretary Clinton — Senator Sanders, let me just follow up with you. As president, you have to decide where to spend your political capital. There’s a lot of things you want to do, where does fixing Mrs. Kim’s daughter’s school and other schools, where does that lay in your list of things to do...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="279" data-total-count="73796"><strong>SANDERS:</strong> ... Anderson, not only do we have a crumbling school system in Detroit, and in many other areas, we have — and everybody in this room should be embarrassed by this, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth. That is a disgrace.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="73806">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="346" data-total-count="74152"><strong>SANDERS:</strong> So, when you ask me about my priorities, my priorities are that no, we’re not going to give tax breaks to the wealthy. We’re going to ask them to start paying their fair share of taxes so we can raise the money to make sure that every child in this country, in Detroit, in Vermont, gets the quality education that he or she deserves.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="74162">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="26" data-total-count="74188"><strong>COOPER:</strong> Secretary Clinton?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="287" data-total-count="74475"><strong>CLINTON:</strong> Mrs. Kim (ph), here is what I would do as president. Number one, I would reinstate a program we did have during the 1990’s where the federal government provided funding to repair and modernize public schools because a lot of communities can’t afford to do that on their own.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="74485">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="192" data-total-count="74677"><strong>CLINTON:</strong> Secondly, I would use every legal means at my disposal to try to force the Governor and the state to return the schools to the people of Detroit — to end the emergency management...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="21" data-total-count="74698">(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="163" data-total-count="74861"><strong>CLINTON:</strong> ... which, I believe, if you look at the data, the situation has only gotten worse with these emergency managers that have put the system further in debt.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="74871">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="690" data-total-count="75561"><strong>CLINTON:</strong> Number three, I want to set-up inside the Department of Education, for want of a better term, kind of an education SWAT team, if you will. Where we’ve got qualified people, teachers, principals, maybe folks who are retired, maybe folks who are active, but all of whom are willing to come and help. When Detroit gets back their schools, they should have all the help they can get to be able to get teachers in the classroom, to be able to find spaces while schools are being repaired. And, I also would look at how we could through the federal government support more teachers because we’re going to have a teacher shortage in some of the hardest to teach districts...(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="23" data-total-count="75584"><strong>COOPER:</strong> ... (inaudible)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="31" data-total-count="75615"><strong>CLINTON:</strong> ... including Detroit.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="82" data-total-count="75697"><strong>COOPER:</strong> Let me just follow up with the Secretary and then I’ll come back to you.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="397" data-total-count="76094">Secretary Clinton, you’ve been endorsed by two of the biggest teachers’ unions. There’s an awful lot of great teachers in this country. It’s an incredibly difficult job, one of the most difficult jobs there is but union rules often make it impossible fire bad teachers and that means disadvantaged kids are sometimes taught by the least qualified. Do you think unions protect bad teachers?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="374" data-total-count="76468"><strong>CLINTON:</strong> You know, I am proud to have been endorsed by the AFT and the NEA, and I’ve had very good relationship with both unions, with their leadership. And we’ve really candid conversations because we are going to have to take a look at — what do we need in the 21st century to really involve families, to help kids who have more problems than just academic problems?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="256" data-total-count="76724">A lot of what has happened and honestly it really pains me, a lot of people have blaming and scape-goating teachers because they don’t want to put the money into the schools system that deserve the support that comes from the government doing it’s job.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="78" data-total-count="76802"><strong>COOPER:</strong> So just to follow up, you don’t believe unions protect bad teachers?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="191" data-total-count="76993"><strong>CLINTON:</strong> You know what - I have told my friends at the top of both unions, we’ve got take a look at this because it is one of the most common criticisms. We need to eliminate the criticism.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="281" data-total-count="77274">You know, teachers do so much good, they are often working under most difficult circumstances. So anything that could be changed, I want them to look at it. I will be a good partner to make sure that whatever I can do as president, I will do to support the teachers of our country.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="24" data-total-count="77298"><strong>COOPER:</strong> Senator Sanders?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="508" data-total-count="77806"><strong>SANDERS:</strong> What our campaign is about, is asking people to think big not small. And when we think big and we talk about education, we’ve got to ask ourselves a simple question, how is it — starting at college that hundreds of thousands of bright young people are today, unable to go to college because they can’t afford it? How is it that maybe your kid — and when I was growing up, we didn’t have any money — we’re not even dreaming about going to college because they knew it was another world.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="179" data-total-count="77985">So starting with the top, now I know some people think it’s a radical idea, I don’t. I believe that every public college and university in this country should be tuition free.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="77995">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="276" data-total-count="78271">So that your child regardless of the income of your family knows that if she’s studies hard, she is going to be able to go to college. And you know what else we do? We invest in child care. Right now, you’ve got child-care workers making McDonald’s wages, that is crazy.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="26" data-total-count="78297"><strong>COOPER:</strong> Thank you Senator.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="108" data-total-count="78405"><strong>SANDERS:</strong> I want well trained, well paid, child care workers to give our youngest kids advance opportunities.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="53" data-total-count="78458"><strong>COOPER:</strong> I want to go over to my colleague, Don Lemon.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="37" data-total-count="78495"><strong>LEMON:</strong> Anderson, thank you very much.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="519" data-total-count="79014">Secretary, I want to turn now from the state of our nation’s school to the state of our nation’s crumbling infrastructure, which you talked a little bit about in the beginning of this debate. But beyond the Detroit schools and Flint water crisis; pipes, roads, and bridges are in need of repair. It would take trillions of dollars to fix it all. Senator Sanders has proposed a one trillion dollar plan but yours is only a quarter of that, is your plan big enough to fix the crumbling infrastructure in this country?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="290" data-total-count="79304"><strong>CLINTON:</strong> Well, there’s no doubt, we have an enormous backlog of infrastructure repairs. Here’s what I’d do - the congress finally got around to pass the Highway Transportation Bill, which should never have been partisan - it turned into be one partisan argument.

And especially when you are in the position that I’m in and that Senator Sanders is in, where you are asking people to vote for you, to give you the most important job, not only in our country, but I would argue in the world.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="193" data-total-count="96429">I think humility is one of the most important attributes that you bring to both that seeking and then if you’re fortunate enough, to that holding of office and that’s what I will try to do.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="96439">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="526" data-total-count="96965"><strong>COOPER:</strong> Thank you, secretary. It’s time for closing statements. You’ll each have one minute for a closing statement. Senator Sanders, we begin with you. SANDERS: My father came to this country at the age of 17 without any money. Never made any money. We lived in a three and half room rent-controlled apartment. So I learned about economics, not just in college, but in living in a family that didn’t have money that had to scrape by. We are here tonight in Flint, Michigan, because a horrendous tragedy is taking place.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="432" data-total-count="97397">But it’s not just in Flint, Michigan. We are have 29 million people who have no health insurance. We’re the only major country on earth that doesn’t provide paid family and medical leave. We have school systems around America that are collapsing. And yet we are the wealthiest country in the history of the world. But most people don’t know that because almost all of the new incoming wealth is going to the top one percent.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="278" data-total-count="97675">I believe, and with all due respect to my good friend, Secretary Clinton, that it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics. It is too late for a corrupt campaign finance system and super-PACs that raise enormous amounts of money from special interests.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="155" data-total-count="97830">We need in this country a political revolution where ordinary people stand up and reclaim the government that men and women fought and died for. Thank you.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="97840">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="37" data-total-count="97877"><strong>COOPER:</strong> Thank you, senator.(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="26" data-total-count="97903"><strong>COOPER:</strong> Secretary Clinton?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="476" data-total-count="98379"><strong>CLINTON:</strong> Well, I’m running for president to do my very best to knock down every barrier that stands in the way of America realizing its potential and every American having a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. We have a lot of work to do. We have economic barriers. That’s why I’ve laid out plans for more good jobs with rising incomes. We have barriers that stand in the way of quality health care. That’s why I will build on the Affordable Care Act.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="326" data-total-count="98705">We have barriers to education. That’s why I want to start early and provide debt-free tuition, and deal with student debt so it is no longer the burden that weighs down so many young Americans. And I do want to take on the barriers of systemic racism. I may not have experienced them, but I see the results every single day.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="192" data-total-count="98897">So I’m asking for your support in the primary here in Michigan on Tuesday. I’m asking for it, and I will do whatever I can as the Democratic nominee to run a campaign you’ll be proud of.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="189" data-total-count="99086">I don’t intend to get into the gutter with whoever they nominate, but instead to lift our sights, to set big goals, to make it clear that America’s best days can be and are ahead of us.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="99096">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="211" data-total-count="99307"><strong>COOPER:</strong> I want to thank both the candidates. While we’ve been debating tonight, CNN has learned that a labor union fund has committed $25 million in low-interest loans to help replace lead- contaminated pipes.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="68" data-total-count="99375">I want to thank the candidates, the Democratic National Committee...</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="10" data-total-count="99385">(APPLAUSE)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="224" data-total-count="99609">... our hosts here at the Flint Cultural Center, and most of all, the people of Flint. Just two days from now, it’s another Super Tuesday, when Michigan and three other states have primaries. We’ll have all-day coverage.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="270" data-total-count="99879">On Wednesday we’ll simulcast the next Democratic presidential debate. We’ll air on CNN in English, and then on Univision in Spanish. And on Thursday, CNN hosts a Republican presidential debate in Miami — the last one before the critical Florida and Ohio primaries.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="221" data-total-count="100100">We’ll have full analysis of tonight’s debate in one hour.

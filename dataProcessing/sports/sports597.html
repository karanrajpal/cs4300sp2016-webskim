Peter Angelos, the owner of the Orioles, was a strong critic of the economic blockade of the island nation, however, and sought to foster improved relations between the countries through baseball.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="228" data-total-count="841">He had previously been denied requests to take his team to Cuba, but when President Bill Clinton announced an easing of travel restrictions, Angelos, a Clinton donor, appealed again and was granted permission to pursue his idea.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="459" data-total-count="1300">Bud Selig, then the baseball commissioner, appointed Sandy Alderson, now the Mets’ general manager but then one of his key deputies, as his point man. Alderson, Angelos and a small contingent of other baseball officials went to Cuba in early March to lay the groundwork for the trip. Weeks later, the Orioles played the Cuban national team, the first time a major league club had been in Cuba in 40 years. Five weeks later, there was a rematch in Baltimore.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="118" data-total-count="1418">In recent interviews, participants in those games looked back, often with a little bit of wonderment at what occurred.</p><div id="story-ad-1" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

In my mind, it was unfortunate and never should have happened. So I felt we had to put all that aside and re-establish the dialogue. I felt the two countries could get together and put behind their differences, and what better way to start than through baseball, the national sport of both countries?”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="222" data-total-count="2055"><strong>SANDY ALDERSON</strong>, <em>baseball’s point man in the talks with Cuba:</em> “I don’t think M.L.B. would have done it without Peter really pushing it. It ended up costing him a lot of money because he had to cover all the losses.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="286" data-total-count="2341"><strong>BRADY ANDERSON,</strong> <em>one of the Orioles’ top players at the time: </em>“I was for it. I wanted to go play the Cuban team. I had always dreamed of playing internationally, but I never had the chance to play in the Olympics. I knew it was going to be historic, interesting and unprecedented.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="19" data-total-count="2360"><strong>The Final Approvals</strong></p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="210" data-total-count="2570">The Orioles and Major League Baseball needed permission from the United States government before any game could take place. Both Clinton and his secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, weighed in on the matter.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="266" data-total-count="2836"><strong>ALDERSON</strong> “What I recall was most fascinating was all the preliminary work, the advance work both in Washington and Havana. We went to the White House and talked with Sandy Berger, who was the national security adviser at the time. We went to the State Department.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="208" data-total-count="3044">“We didn’t have to talk anyone into it, but there were clearly different elements of the government with different points of view. It was President Clinton and Peter Angelos who kind of rammed it through.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="469" data-total-count="3513">“The big issue was, what is going to happen to the revenue? Will it end up benefiting the Castro government? I kept saying, There isn’t going to be any revenue because of the cost of the television production, the cost of transporting the players and the upgrade of the stadium and all the accommodations and so forth. And I heard that the average ticket price for the game was, like, 10 cents. Unfortunately, most of the attendees were probably party officials.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="23" data-total-count="3536"><strong>Preparations For Game 1</strong></p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="289" data-total-count="3825"><strong>ALDERSON</strong> “ESPN had already committed its schedule for the day we were considering. I remember they were willing to clear their schedule, but they weren’t willing to pay for anything, including the cost of the production, which I believe included bringing the equipment in from Florida.</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

The whole stadium had to be upgraded, the turf, the dirt infield.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="326" data-total-count="4346">“Because of the sanctions, you couldn’t bring in anything that was going to stay in the country. Everything you brought in had to stay with you, or if it stayed in Cuba, it had to be licensed or come from a third country. So a lot of the supplies, especially the groundskeeping equipment and supplies, came from Canada.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="18" data-total-count="4364"><strong>Cuba Prepares, Too</strong></p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="387" data-total-count="4751"><strong>DANILO VALIENTE</strong>, <em>now a Yankees coach, then the third-base coach for the Cuban national team</em> <em>(he spoke last week through an interpreter): </em>“Before the game, we were worried because in our league, we don’t use wooden bats. We only had about 10 to 15 days to practice with wooden bats. There were a lot of expectations for us from the fans. They wanted us to do good and show our talent.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="81" data-total-count="4832">“Eventually we got used to it, but at the beginning, we broke a lot of bats.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="424" data-total-count="5256"><strong>PETER SCHMUCK</strong>, <em>a reporter for The Baltimore Sun</em>, who <em>accompanied the first delegation to Cuba:</em> “In order to get on the plane, I had to be listed as a special assistant to the owner, because the Cubans would not allow journalists. But they weren’t fooled.

His brother Raul was there, too.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="594" data-total-count="6932"><strong>BUD SELIG</strong>, <em>baseball’s commissioner at the time: </em>“We got to the hotel and my wife said to me, ‘I want to see downtown Havana on a Saturday night.’ The phone rang in our room and everything reminded me of my days in the 1950s because of what you saw, whether it was phones, hotels, cars, everything. This voice on the other end said, ‘Palace, 7 o’clock.’ I said to my wife, ‘We’ll stay there for 15 or 20 minutes, meet him and then go.’ We get there and after about 45 minutes, in comes Fidel dressed exactly as you had seen him for 40 years. He invited us to stay for dinner.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="222" data-total-count="7154">“We didn’t leave until 3 o’clock in the morning. I could tell you it was a seven-course meal, but it might have been a 27-course meal; I lost track. There was a lot of conversation. It was a remarkable experience.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="341" data-total-count="7495"><strong>ANGELOS</strong> “We had a great time meeting with him and talking about the problems that we were both confronted with. We Americans, at least I did, felt we should get back together again, and he seemed very willing and eager to talk about that, although I told him clearly that I had no authority to discuss that. It was just a personal opinion.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="295" data-total-count="7790">“A number of owners came along with us.

Cookie Rojas was the third-base coach of the Mets at the time. Bobby Valentine was the manager of the Mets, and Rey Ordonez, a Cuban defector, was the team’s shortstop. The Cuban-born Rafael Palmeiro was the Orioles’ designated hitter.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="320" data-total-count="9092"><strong>COOKIE ROJAS</strong> “I strongly disagreed with the decision because I did not want anything to support Castro.

Jose Contreras, who later defected to the United States, pitched eight scoreless innings in relief for Cuba, allowing only two hits and striking out 10.

The Cubans had planned to stay the night and leave the next day, but they mobilized their party ahead of schedule, presumably to thwart possible defections. One former player, who had become a team coach, did defect, and six others from the delegation, none of them players, missed the hastily arranged flight. But they returned home soon after.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="422" data-total-count="12676"><strong>ALDERSON</strong> “They were going to play the game that night in Baltimore and they were going to fly out the next morning. But they were so worried about defections that they decided to fly out that night after the game. They took people straight from the ballpark and rousted people out of the hotel and took off into the night, and they left about seven or eight people that they missed at the hotel.

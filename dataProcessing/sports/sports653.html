<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="64" data-total-count="1536" id="story-continues-2">Before all of them, and scores of others, there was Rene Arocha.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="147" data-total-count="1683">He never got a big-money contract or played memorably enough to be a household name, even among ardent fans. At best, he may be a curious footnote.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="239" data-total-count="1922">But on July 10, 1991, he committed a simple but utterly rebellious act that opened the way for the modern surge of Cuban players: He walked away from the Cuban national team during a layover in Miami and sought asylum in the United States.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="101" data-total-count="2023">Until then, no active player on the national team, the best of the best in the country, had defected.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="298" data-total-count="2321">“He was the one who started the current wave of players defecting and deciding to come to the U.S. and staying here,” said Peter C. Bjarkman, a longtime scholar of Cuban baseball, whose book “Cuba’s Baseball Defectors” is scheduled for publication in May. “He really was the pioneer.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="81" data-total-count="2402">Now, the kind of defections to which Arocha opened the way may be on the way out.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="167" data-total-count="2569">After Fidel Castro took power in 1959, he abolished professional baseball and established the National Series, a 16-team amateur league run by a government department.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="169" data-total-count="2738">“This is the triumph of free baseball over slave baseball,” Castro declared, showing his distaste for the buying and selling of players in the United States leagues.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="146" data-total-count="2884">Before Arocha defected, a few players managed to make it to the United States, but none had been active players on the high-profile national team.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="373" data-total-count="3257">One player, Barbaro Garbey, who had been imprisoned on a game-fixing charge and who left Cuba on the Mariel boatlift, a mass migration of more than 120,000 Cuban refugees to the United States in 1980, did make it to the major leagues. But Garbey was not an active player when he left Cuba, Bjarkman said, and his departure did not cause nearly the stir that Arocha’s did.</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

What made him above average is you could tell winning was always on his mind.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="28" data-total-count="10429"><strong>A Short but Pioneering Stint</strong></p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="72" data-total-count="10501">Pitching in Cuba was one thing; pitching in the big leagues was another.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="159" data-total-count="10660">“I thought my years of experience would help, but I had a lot to learn,” Arocha said. “Slider, sinker, everything. I mostly used the fastball in Cuba.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="144" data-total-count="10804">Arocha went 11-8 his rookie season in 1993. He remembered standing on the mound in that first game against the Cincinnati Reds on April 9, 1993.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="64" data-total-count="10868">“I thought, I really did it,” he said. “I have arrived.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="47" data-total-count="10915">It turned out to be the pinnacle of his career.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="39" data-total-count="10954">The next season, he was in the bullpen.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="311" data-total-count="11265">Arocha did not adjust well, mentally or physically, and ended up with an elbow injury that at first was diagnosed as a bone chip but was later found to be a torn tendon. He required Tommy John surgery, and in his eyes and the eyes of his associates, it signaled the end of his career. He missed the 1996 season.</p><div id="story-ad-7" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="182" data-total-count="11447" id="story-continues-10">He was cut by the Cardinals after playing three seasons and signed with the San Francisco Giants in 1997 for a season but did not start, relegated to one of their minor league teams.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="227" data-total-count="11674">In 1998, he played for the New Orleans Zephyrs, a Houston Astros Class AAA team, then went on to play in Mexican leagues in 1999 and discussed a comeback with the Mets in 2000, but there was not enough interest, and he retired.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="201" data-total-count="11875">He settled here, because the community had always welcomed him. Thousands of fans of Cuban descent had watched and cheered him here when he had pitched against the Marlins in a game that rookie season.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="258" data-total-count="12133">“Without a doubt, Arocha was a pitcher with a lot of talent, but injuries and bad luck always followed him,” said Ian Padron, a Cuban filmmaker who featured Arocha in his 2003 documentary on Cuban baseball, “Fuera de Liga” (“Out of This League”).</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="133" data-total-count="12266">Still, Arocha’s relative success when he was healthy answered doubts about whether top Cuban players could play in the big leagues.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="267" data-total-count="12533">“His rookie season alone was solid enough to answer the many doubts of the skeptics,” Bjarkman writes in his new book, “and to demonstrate that at least the top Cuban League pitchers could indeed make the grade at the highest levels of professional baseball.”</p><figure id="sports-email-promo" class="interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-small">

I don’t have patience for that. I liked playing baseball.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="81" data-total-count="12874">He likened his split with the sport to a “chapter in my life that has ended.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="101" data-total-count="12975">“Sometimes they come around and ask me to play softball,” he added. “I don’t even do that.”</p><div id="story-ad-8" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

His signing bonus with St. Louis was $15,000. (“I thought it was a fortune,” he said.) The most he made in a season was $300,000.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="167" data-total-count="13967">“I don’t have control over such things,” he said of the difference in contracts. “Those players deserve it. They have the talent. I was in a different time.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="362" data-total-count="14329">He still harbors doubts about Cuba and the talk of changes there. Several of his relatives have gone on trips to Cuba and encouraged him to go, but he said he doubted that much had really changed. His only visit came during a 1994 humanitarian tour to visit refugees at the American military base at Guantánamo, which is walled off from the rest of the country.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="88" data-total-count="14417">“Players are going to keep coming because there still is no freedom there,” he said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="182" data-total-count="14599">He noted that Puig and a few other players who had defected visited Cuba in November but only as part of a good-will trip organized by Major League Baseball and the players’ union.</p><div id="story-ad-9" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

I haven’t named it yet, but I have the name picked out.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="30" data-total-count="15324">He smiles, pausing for effect.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="19" data-total-count="15343">“Industriales!”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="64" data-total-count="15407">And he laughs loudly at the inside joke, one for the Cuban fans.</p><footer class="story-footer story-content">

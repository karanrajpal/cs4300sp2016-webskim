A bulky milepost?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="392" data-total-count="547">Carlton Hall pointed to the puzzling object and explained that it was once a tie-down block for securing structures like antenna towers. Dr. Hall, the chief scientist for the space center’s ecological program, said that when he started working here a few decades ago, the block had been buried. Now the sand that enveloped it is gone, swept away by the forces of coastal erosion and storms.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="106" data-total-count="653">He gestured toward the waves rolling in nearby and said, “The beach used to be at least 50 yards out.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="182" data-total-count="835">On the other side of the dunes, a quarter mile away, sit two artificial hills some 50 feet high.

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="328" data-total-count="6740">As climate change threatens, NASA has options that include hardening facilities against the rising seas with barriers and structures adapted to storms and flooding, or if adaptation is not possible, to strategically retreat. Any such strategies will be expensive — though how expensive at this early stage is anyone’s guess.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="211" data-total-count="6951">Retreat, however, is hardly an option any time soon for an agency that would need billions of dollars for new buildings and equipment alone — not to mention the need to relocate staff with extensive expertise.</p><div id="story-ad-4" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="237" data-total-count="7188" id="story-continues-8">One thing is certain: Pads will still be needed. Kennedy Space Center will be the home to NASA’s next-generation human spaceflight vehicles, and its pads are being used by private space companies like SpaceX and United Launch Alliance.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="123" data-total-count="7311">In fact, the Space Coast is enjoying a revival since the dire years after the space shuttle program was mothballed in 2011.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="437" data-total-count="7748">Christopher J. Ferguson, a former astronaut who now heads Boeing’s efforts to develop a new crew capsule for future launches, said he was excited to see the renewed activity. Communities along the Space Coast, he said, “went through very trying times.” Housing values plummeted and commerce ebbed. Even Shuttles, the space-themed restaurant and bar nearby on Merritt Island, shut down. Now the cold beer and cheeseburgers are back.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="30" data-total-count="7778">The question is, for how long?</p><h4 class="story-subheading story-content" data-para-count="14" data-total-count="7792">Why the Coast?</h4><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="138" data-total-count="7930">Which leads to another obvious question: Why build billions of dollars worth of launch infrastructure on a risky coast in the first place?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="380" data-total-count="8310">Safety and physics tell the tale. Launching over water is safer than over land and people. Also, rockets are best launched from sites closer to the Earth’s fat Equator, where the greater diameter of the planet provides a slingshot effect that gives each rocket more bang for the propulsion buck. The Air Force was already firing missiles from Cape Canaveral when NASA showed up.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="160" data-total-count="8470">The idea of firing from Florida preceded space travel by nearly 100 years. In 1865, Jules Verne foresaw launches from Tampa in “From the Earth to the Moon.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="473" data-total-count="8943">Verne, in fact, even <a href="http://www.online-literature.com/verne/earth_to_moon/11/">envisioned a competition</a> for the launch site between Florida and the Gulf Coast of Texas, with a pitched political battle for the plum program. In real life, Florida got the launches, and coastal Texas got the Johnson Space Center, home to mission control and astronaut training. Special barges from Michoud carried the oversize shuttle fuel tanks —too big for easy passage on rails or roads — via the Intracoastal Waterway to Kennedy Space Center.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="134" data-total-count="9077">And that is the conundrum for NASA. Water, once the solution to many of the space agency’s problems, is becoming its biggest threat.</p><footer class="story-footer story-content">

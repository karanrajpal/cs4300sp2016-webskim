<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="235" data-total-count="1464" id="story-continues-1">“The arithmetic is really brutal,” said Jeffrey D. Sachs, a prominent Columbia University economist. “We’re in such a dreadful situation that every country has to make this transformation, or else this isn’t going to work.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="348" data-total-count="1812">Dr. Sachs helped start what is perhaps the most serious effort to draw up a detailed road map for the energy transition: the <a href="http://deepdecarbonization.org/">Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project</a>, based in Paris and New York. Over the past couple of years, the effort enlisted teams from 16 countries, which account for the large majority of global emissions, to devise such plans.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="404" data-total-count="2216">The analysts used conservative assumptions about current technologies and their costs. They also presumed that developed countries would not be willing to make big changes in their way of life — that people would continue to insist on transportation, refrigerators, electric lights and so forth — and that poor countries would keep striving to reach higher standards of living, requiring more energy.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="463" data-total-count="2679">The experts also made a point of ruling out energy miracles, such as technologies like nuclear fusion that could help enormously if they became available but are still largely on the drawing board. “If we couldn’t put on a hard hat and go visit a technology in the field, at least in pilot stage, then we didn’t include it in our analysis,” said Ben Haley, a senior consultant at Energy and Environmental Economics, a consulting firm involved in the work.</p> <figure id="what-is-climate-change" class="interactive promo  layout-large">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="325" data-total-count="4408">Yet the new research on decarbonization also suggests that the environmentalists who have long called for a rapid expansion of existing clean-energy technologies also have a point: The very process of rolling them out helps to spur innovation, and as they spread beyond niche markets, economies of scale drive down the costs.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="321" data-total-count="4729">Solar power offers a stunning example, with costs of the panels plunging 80 percent in the last decade, a direct result of subsidies and other policies meant to create a larger market. In many places, <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/energy-environment/solar-energy/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about solar power." class="meta-classifier">solar power</a> is still more expensive than power produced from fossil fuels, but the difference has narrowed considerably.</p>        <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#story-continues-3">Continue reading the main story</a>

        <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="333" data-total-count="5062" id="story-continues-4">Wind turbines have been a big winner, too, in recent years. They supply almost 5 percent of the electric power in the United States, and in a handful of American states and some smaller countries, that figure has moved into double digits. Wind power is so abundant in Texas that one company there is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/09/business/energy-environment/a-texas-utility-offers-a-nighttime-special-free-electricity.html">giving away</a> electricity at night.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="289" data-total-count="5351">The good news about wind and solar power has inspired claims that they could carry the entire load of the energy transition. Mark Z. Jacobson, an engineer at Stanford University, has drawn attention with a finding that the entire world could <a href="http://thesolutionsproject.org/">operate on 100 percent renewable power</a> by 2050.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="319" data-total-count="5670">Yet such scenarios would involve an extraordinary push. Dr. Jacobson’s plans would require, among many other actions, that 156,000 wind turbines be built off American coasts in the next 35 years, and twice as many on land. In 20 years of effort, European countries have managed to build about 3,000 offshore turbines.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="345" data-total-count="6015">In an interview, Dr. Jacobson cited a scientific paper that calculated the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/energy-environment/oil-petroleum-and-gasoline/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about oil." class="meta-classifier">oil</a> and gas industry has been building 50,000 new wells a year in North America since 2000. Each of those, he said, is as complicated as erecting a wind turbine, and building tens of thousands of turbines a year would be well within the nation’s industrial capability.</p><div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="204" data-total-count="6219" id="story-continues-5">“We think it’s technically and economically feasible,” Dr. Jacobson said. “It ultimately does come down to political will. If people don’t want to do it, it’s not going to happen by itself.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="253" data-total-count="6472">Dr. Jacobson has often cited the United States’ mobilization during World War II as an example of what can be done by a determined society. But to some other experts, that very argument speaks to the political and economic impracticality of his plans.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="270" data-total-count="6742">“I just don’t see a World War II-style mobilization happening for anything other than a world war,” said Jesse Jenkins, an energy analyst at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “We’re not going to do that. So the question is, what are we going to do?”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="358" data-total-count="7100">The scenarios laid out by the Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project echo Dr. Jacobson’s plans to a degree, in that they call for substantial amounts of renewable power. But these scenarios also suggest that the energy transition would be easier and cheaper with additional technology options, including some that are disliked by the environmental movement.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="288" data-total-count="7388">For instance, in some countries with growing power demands, like China, the research found that nuclear power would be essential for staying within a strict emissions budget. Mr. Jenkins said that new nuclear plants would also be needed in some American states that had few other options.</p><figure id="2015-paris-climate-promo" class="interactive interactive-embedded  limit-xsmall layout-small">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="391" data-total-count="7779">And many experts believe the United States, even if it does not build many new nuclear plants, would be foolish to shut down the ones it has, given that they supply 19 percent of the country’s electric power with minimal emissions. Yet some of them have shut down lately, occasionally because of safety fears but mainly because of low power prices prompted by the abundance of <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/energy-environment/natural-gas/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about natural gas." class="meta-classifier">natural gas</a>.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="247" data-total-count="8026">The research also suggests that to meet strict targets, some countries might need to keep burning coal or natural gas to generate power while capturing the carbon dioxide emerging from smokestacks, compressing it and injecting it deep underground.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="440" data-total-count="8466">Governments have discussed the need for this technology, known as carbon capture and storage, for decades. But they have put <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/11/science/earth/study-finds-setbacks-in-carbon-capture-projects.html">little effort</a> into developing it, and it has not advanced much beyond the demonstration scale, though a few projects are starting to come online. Environmental groups have been wary of the technology, and Germany, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/science/earth/sun-and-wind-alter-german-landscape-leaving-utilities-behind.html">among the most determined countries</a> in battling global warming, has largely decided not to pursue it.</p><div id="story-ad-4" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="185" data-total-count="8651" id="story-continues-6">Most fossil-fuel companies do not appear to be putting much effort into the approach, either, even though it may be the only way for some of them to stay in business over the long haul.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="162" data-total-count="8813">“It is a highly contested technology, but if they want to save their industry, they should be investing like crazy in proving the technology,” Dr. Sachs said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="270" data-total-count="9083">Perhaps the most compelling finding of the Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project is that governments could easily flub the energy transition by failing to plan far enough ahead. Most countries are setting 10- and 15-year targets that can be met with incremental changes.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="197" data-total-count="9280">Yet that almost guarantees that the toughest problems, like perfecting the carbon-capturing technology, will be tackled too late to meet the long-term goal of zero emissions, the researchers found.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="283" data-total-count="9563">“By the time you get to the hard things, you’ve lost too much time,” Mr. Schmidt-Traub said. Instead, governments have to figure out where they want to be in 2050, he said, and then work backward to plot the necessary technological path, while remaining open to new inventions.</p><h4 class="story-subheading story-content" data-para-count="13" data-total-count="9576">Shared Themes</h4><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="205" data-total-count="9781">While the best technology mix varies by state or country — wind is a good option in Iowa, solar power in Arizona or Australia — the researchers found some themes across all the countries they examined.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="324" data-total-count="10105">To achieve the emissions goals, the entire economy, including transportation, needs to be electrified as much as possible. That might mean cars’ running on batteries, but it could also mean cars’ running on hydrogen, created by using nighttime electricity from nuclear reactors or wind turbines to split water molecules.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="300" data-total-count="10405">Either way, the implication is that the internal-combustion engine that has powered cars since the 19th <sup></sup> century is a technological dead end in the 21st<sup></sup>. So countries like the United States that are spending a lot of effort trying to make gasoline cars more efficient may be going down a blind alley.</p><div id="story-ad-5" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="294" data-total-count="10699" id="story-continues-7">The scenarios for the United States, according to the Deep Decarbonization project, do not envision broad adoption of electric cars until the 2030s. But that is only 14 years away, suggesting an urgent need to make the cars better and cheaper, and to roll out charging stations by the millions.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="334" data-total-count="11033">Another potential dead end, the research suggests, would be an overreliance on natural gas. Gas is a lower-carbon fuel than coal, and switching power plants to run on gas can achieve big emission reductions in the short run. The Obama administration, with its Clean Power Plan, is trying to lock in such a switch in the United States.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="219" data-total-count="11252">But the deep-decarbonization research suggests that gas has to go away within a few decades, which means that heavy investment in natural gas pipelines and power plants now could wind up undermining the long-term goals.</p><h4 class="story-subheading story-content" data-para-count="22" data-total-count="11274">What Government Can Do</h4><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="263" data-total-count="11537">If it is mayors and city councilors and governors who are most determined to move forward — as the <a href="http://under2mou.org/">pledge</a> they are signing before and during the Paris conference makes clear — what effect can they have on their own, without much support at the national level?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="328" data-total-count="11865">Some answers are fairly obvious, experts said. In some countries, including the United States, state and local governments control the building codes, many of which still do not include tough requirements for reducing energy demand in new buildings. Cities like Austin, Tex., have shown how to set strict codes and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/18/business/energy-environment/18codes.html">enforce</a> them.</p><figure id="climate-change-promotron" class="interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-sub-medium">

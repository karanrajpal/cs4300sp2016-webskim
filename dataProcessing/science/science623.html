They’re making fun of me,” Frank said recently over pizza near his apartment in the San Francisco Bay Area. Dressed in a light jacket and khakis, he was watchful, low-key and engaged, as if discussing something with a professor after class. “The real voices would merge with the ones in my head, and there was just too much noise. I had to shut it down.”</p><h4 class="story-subheading story-content" data-para-count="17" data-total-count="3287">A Downward Spiral</h4><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="318" data-total-count="3605">He told no one what was happening. Not his parents, not his friends. He simply retreated; in his spare time, he would hole up in his bedroom in his family’s colonial-style house outside New York City, the shades down, the door locked, the covers pulled over his head, his face lost in the dead blue glow of a laptop.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="82" data-total-count="3687">“I thought at first he was just being an obstinate teenager,” his father said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="327" data-total-count="4014">His best friend, Perry, said he got Frank out of the house one morning, and the two went to a local bagel place. “He just told me: ‘Hey man, it’s over, I don’t want to see you anymore,’” said Perry, who asked that his last name not be used, to protect Frank. “He was so calm when he said it, it freaked me out.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="572" data-total-count="4586">Frank’s parents had sent their son to specialists before and received diagnoses of <a href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/depression/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="In-depth reference and news articles about Depression (Mental)." class="meta-classifier">depression</a> and <a href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="In-depth reference and news articles about Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder." class="meta-classifier">attention deficit disorder</a>. But this was something much more ominous, his mother said in an interview recently in the sunroom of their home. The walls in the formal living room were a gallery of proud family memories. She and Frank’s father asked that the family’s identity be protected so their son would have a chance at a normal life in a country where psychosis is often stigmatized.

EASA began with five centers and in 2007 opened centers in counties throughout the state. The New York program began in 2013, with four locations around New York City, and has since added a half-dozen more statewide. The programs rely on a combination of state funds and insurance reimbursement, and 32 states have begun using block grants set aside by Congress in 2014 to fund such programs.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="206" data-total-count="9042">How much difference those programs will make is not clear. For example, the government-backed study released this fall found that the new approach had not reduced hospitalizations, a big driver of expenses.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="419" data-total-count="9461">But at last count, about 80 percent of the people who enrolled in OnTrackNY 18 months ago have remained in the program. Most of them were still in school or working, according to Dr. Dixon, who is also a professor of psychiatry at Columbia. About 60 percent of those who received care through EASA, the longer-running Oregon program, are working or in school, according to Tamara Sale, the program’s director of care.</p> <figure id="lives-restored-series" class="interactive promo  layout-large">

He had gained 20 pounds on one of the drugs, and another had made it hard for him to form thoughts. Both are common side effects of such medications.</p> <figure id="2015-top-health-medical-stories" class="interactive promo  layout-small">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="317" data-total-count="11442">It was during one unmedicated period that Frank developed his elaborate suicide plan. He was serious enough to promise an equally troubled Facebook friend that he was on the brink of acting. But he also informed Dr. Dole, almost casually, as he recalls it — and, this time, she was the one who had him hospitalized.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="170" data-total-count="11612">“I never would have said anything if I didn’t trust her, so yeah, I felt betrayed when she had me taken away,” Frank said. “But I am still here, thanks to her.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="233" data-total-count="11845">Dr. Dole used that art of persistent suggestion to persuade Frank to try medication again, reminding him that the two of them, with the help of the program’s psychiatrist, would work out what dosage — and which drug — was best.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="182" data-total-count="12027">If he did not like a medication, she told him, he could quit. If he preferred very low doses — enough to ease the voices but not quiet them, for instance — he could do that, too.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="364" data-total-count="12391">Many people quit the drugs, not only because of the side effects but because they do not think the medicine is making much difference. These new programs address this doubt by having the patient and at least one family member keep a careful diary of behavior change as a dosage is gradually reduced. The diaries provide a clear record from multiple points of view.</p><div id="story-ad-6" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="162" data-total-count="12553" id="story-continues-9">Frank also met with a social worker at the program, Jim Coyle, who helped arrange for him to continue his studies at home while trying to cope with the psychosis.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="369" data-total-count="12922">In spring 2014, about six months into the program and back home from the hospital, Frank began speaking to his parents again. He and his father talked about the saxophonist John Coltrane and played albums together. He hung out with his mother in the kitchen, helping her cook. And then, one night, as his parents were going to sleep, Frank came in and sat on their bed.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="66" data-total-count="12988">He had a plan, he said. He wanted to go to college. In California.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="161" data-total-count="13149">“My husband and I turned to each other and said, ‘We can’t even get him out of his room, how are we going to get him to California?” his mother recalled.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="100" data-total-count="13249">“After everything that happened,” Frank said, “I didn’t think they’d take it seriously.”</p><h4 class="story-subheading story-content" data-para-count="23" data-total-count="13272">On His Own a Coast Away</h4><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="395" data-total-count="13667">But they did. He is in his second year now at college in the Bay Area, taking a light load of three classes and conducting his own course, of sorts, in self-treatment. He regularly visits a clinic here, where he receives medication — an antidepressant, as well as an antipsychotic drug. From a low-dosage beginning, he has decided he needs more. Until recently, he also attended group therapy.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="68" data-total-count="13735">“I know what I need now,” he said over lunch on a recent Friday.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="322" data-total-count="14057">That first year away, he said, he was off medication and began to have a creeping feeling that the housing complex where he lived was the center of a prostitution ring run by the Yakuza, a Japanese crime syndicate. “The Yakuza,” he said, shaking his head. “That’s when I knew I better go back on the medication.”</p><button class="button comments-button  theme-speech-bubble-large" data-skip-to-para-id="">
</button>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="297" data-total-count="14354">He’s in regular touch with his parents, he said, and has reconnected with his friend Perry back in New York, and plans to become a psychologist to help others like himself. He has also made some new friends at college. They occasionally ask him where he has been after a psychiatric appointment.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="168" data-total-count="14522">He does not feel the need to tell them. “I don’t think of myself as somebody who is mentally ill, you know?” he said. “I think of myself as a regular person.”</p><footer class="story-footer story-content">

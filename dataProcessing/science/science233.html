Robinson nuclear power plant, about 70 miles from Columbia, S.C., has been producing electricity with few interruptions since the Nixon administration. But as of now, its fate is clear: The plant will have to shut down by 2030, when it will be six decades old.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="303" data-total-count="572">The Robinson reactor is one of the oldest still operating in the United States, but others are getting on in years. From 2029 to 2035, three dozen of the nation’s 99 reactors, representing more than a third of the industry’s generating capacity, will face closure as their operating licenses expire.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="529" data-total-count="1101">Any shutdowns would be another blow to <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/energy-environment/atomic-energy/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about nuclear energy." class="meta-classifier">nuclear energy</a>, which provides 19 percent of the nation’s electricity but has struggled in recent years to compete against subsidized solar and wind power and plants that burn low-priced natural gas. Industry advocates say that by removing sources of clean electricity — a nuclear reaction produces no carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases — the closings could affect the government’s ability to fulfill its pledge, made at the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/world/europe/climate-change-accord-paris.html" title="Times article, Dec. 12, 2015.">Paris climate talks</a> last year, to reduce emissions.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="130" data-total-count="1231">And to continue to meet the nation’s electrical load, new generating capacity will have to be built to replace any that is lost.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="217" data-total-count="1448">“Some of those plants are going to be retiring,” said Stephen E. Kuczynski, the chief executive of Southern Company’s nuclear subsidiary. “Which means we’re going to need to meet this load with something.”</p><div id="story-ad-1" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

Plant operators may be able to buy time by seeking license extensions for another 20 years from the <a href="http://www.nrc.gov/">Nuclear Regulatory Commission</a>, or by building more large reactors like four that are under construction.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="329" data-total-count="2104">The industry and the <a href="http://energy.gov/">Department of Energy</a> are also pinning their hopes on the development of less conventional reactor designs that are meant to be safer and cheaper to build and operate. Yet it is unclear whether any new designs could reach the market in time to make a dent in the generating capacity lost as plants are closed.</p>        <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#story-continues-3">Continue reading the main story</a>

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="265" data-total-count="2634">“Our target is — can we really move the process forward and have a commercial option by 2030?” Mr. Kuczynski said. To do that, he and others say, the pace of the design process, and of the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/nuclear_regulatory_commission/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about Nuclear Regulatory Commission" class="meta-org">Nuclear Regulatory Commission</a>’s review process, needs to be sped up.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="164" data-total-count="2798">But some say the shortened timetables are unrealistic, given safety and other concerns and the need to test new designs before seeking approval from the commission.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="472" data-total-count="3270">“It’s a 25-year process, no matter what,” said Michael McGough, the chief commercial officer of NuScale Power, which is the furthest along among companies working on less conventional reactors. NuScale’s design, called a <a href="http://www.energy.gov/ne/nuclear-reactor-technologies/small-modular-nuclear-reactors" title="D.O.E. page.">small modular reactor</a>, uses water as a coolant, but the units are far smaller than current reactors and have advanced safety features. They could be built largely in a factory, saving money, and up to 12 of them could be installed at one site.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="487" data-total-count="3757">Mr. McGough knows all about long timetables; NuScale’s design has been under development since 2000. It has lined up a potential first customer, Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems, or Uamps, which operates in the Intermountain West, and hopes to have 12 of the small reactors operating at a site in Idaho by the mid-2020s. “It’s improbable to me that you will see any new design developed or licensed in a much shorter time frame than the kind we’re on,” Mr. McGough said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="253" data-total-count="4010">NuScale has been testing its design for 13 years, using a nonnuclear prototype. Later this year, it plans to submit an 11,000-page application to the N.R.C. to have its design certified. The commission then has up to 40 months to review the application.</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="387" data-total-count="4397" id="story-continues-5">The certification process, and a later application by Uamps for a construction and operating license, could be delayed if the N.R.C. asks for more information. But even if all goes smoothly, the plant will produce only about half the electricity of many existing reactors. About 50 of these 12-reactor plants would be needed to replace the generating capacity that could be lost by 2035.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="227" data-total-count="4624">Many in the industry hope that extending the licenses of existing reactors will forestall at least some closings. Nuclear plants were originally licensed for 40 years, but almost all have sought and received 20-year extensions.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="377" data-total-count="5001">The regulatory commission has begun researching what would be required to extend a plant’s life to 80 years. “We’re asking very basic questions, like how long can a reactor vessel remain acceptable since it’s being bombarded by neutrons,” said Scott Burnell, a spokesman. “The information we have at this point is that those are issues that are not showstoppers.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="294" data-total-count="5295">So far one operator has announced plans to seek such an extension, for two reactors set to close in the early 2030s, but an application and possible approval are still years away. Duke Energy, owner of the Robinson plant in South Carolina, said it was evaluating whether to pursue an extension.</p><figure id="climate-change-promotron" class="interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-sub-medium">

Skeptics cite two American plants that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/05/us/vermont-yankee-nuclear-plant-begins-slow-process-of-closing.html" title="Times article, Jan. 4, 2015.">have been closed</a> for economic reasons since 2012, after their licenses were extended to 60 years.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="335" data-total-count="6013">Similar economic uncertainties surround the latest generation of reactors, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/10/business/energy-environment/2-new-reactors-approved-in-georgia.html" title="Times article, Feb. 10, 2012.">Westinghouse AP1000</a>, a design that is similar in many respects to existing units but has safety improvements and cost-saving features. Four of these are being built in the United States, and there have been lengthy construction delays and ballooning costs.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="310" data-total-count="6323">But Mr. Kuczynski of Southern, which is building two of the reactors in Georgia, said the industry was learning from experience, which would lower the cost of subsequent plants. “We’re going to get through the first of a kind,” he said, and any future orders “are going to be just terrific bargains.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="364" data-total-count="6687">Others are not so sure the industry will rush to build more. “What eventually happens with the four AP1000s will be very important,” said Matthew McKinzie, a senior scientist with the <a href="http://www.nrdc.org/">Natural Resources Defense Council</a>. “If the economics of extending the lifetime of a plant to 80 years are poor, then what does that say about the economics of a new plant?”</p><div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

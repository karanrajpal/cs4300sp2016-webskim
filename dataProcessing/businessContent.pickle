aS'Heres how we analyzed the Republican debate._______MIAMI  The four candidates still battling for the Republican nomination for president gathered at the University of Miami for the partys 12th debate, hosted by CNN. Donald J. Trump leads in both delegates and states won, with Gov. John Kasichs home state, Ohio, and Senator Marco Rubios home state, Florida, both heading to the polls on Tuesday. In a surprise twist, the first question, on jobs and the economy, goes to Mr. Kasich. Asked by Jake Tapper, the debate moderator, if his advocacy for trade deals had come at the expense of the middle class, Mr. Kasich cited his blue-collar background  his father was a mailman and his family worked in the steel industry  and said he believes in free trade, but fair trade. Mr. Rubio  who supports increasing the number of H-1B visas for high-skilled workers  was asked about the case of Disney, which used a loophole in the program to lay off American workers and replace them with foreign workers. Companies like Disney that abuse the program, he said, should be barred from using it in the future. On the question of visas for high-skilled workers, Mr. Trump seemed to try to have it both ways. As a businessman, he said, he uses the program and I do what I have to do. But, he added, its unfair for workers  And we should end it. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas used the H-1B question to switch to the issue of illegal immigration, a hot topic for the Republican base. He said he would cut federal funds to sanctuary cities that dont follow the nations immigration laws. And, he added, Democrats dont have the political will to fix the nations broken immigration system, because they view those illegal immigrants as potential voters. And the mystery of just why Mr. Trump is holding a news conference at Mar-a-Lago, his private club, on Friday morning became clear midway through the first hour, when Mr. Trump declared that Ben Carson, the retired pediatric neurosurgeon, would be endorsing him. He will make sure Mr. Carson will be very involved in his education policies, he added. First of all, Ted was in favor of amnesty, Mr. Trump said. Theres no question about that. In any other debate, those would have been fighting words. But none of the candidates have really had a highly heated exchange yet. As Mr. Trump himself said, just moments later, I cannot believe how civil its been up here. Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump did get into a brief back-and-forth over Mr. Trumps threat to impose a 45 percent tariff on foreign goods. Mr. Trump called it a threat that would become a tax only if foreign countries, like China, dont behave. Mr. Cruz countered that its not China who pays the tax, but the working men and women here in the United States.Not so, Mr. Trump argued, explaining that he would start building those factories and those plants here instead of China, thus creating more jobs. And then it was time for a commercial break. Asked about his recent comments that Islam hates us, and if he really meant all Muslims, Mr. Trump doubled down:  I mean a lot of them, I mean a lot of them, he said. Theres tremendous hatred, and I will stick with exactly what I said. He is not willing to be politically correct, he said.Im not interested in being politically correct  Im interested in being correct, Mr. Rubio retorted, saying the nation would need to work with Muslim countries to help defeat radical extremism. Mr. Kasich, similarly, said that the United States would need Muslim and Arab countries to fight the Islamic State. On an issue that has dogged Mr. Trump in recent weeks  his calls for violating international law and targeting the families of suspected terrorists  the New York billionaire called on existing laws to be expanded in order to fight terrorists on equal footing. Both Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio, meanwhile, quickly and firmly said they would not target the families of terrorists. Mr. Trump said that he would be a strong supporter of Israel, citing a somewhat unlikely list of credentials: his Jewish son-in-law, his daughter Ivanka who converted to Judaism, and his Jewish grandchildren. He also mentioned that he had served as the grand marshal of the Israeli Day Parade down Fifth Avenue.He also added that a peace deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians would be a tough negotiation. But, he said, Id like to give it a shot. Asked about his comments seeming to praise authoritarian governments  calling both President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Chinas government during the Tiananmen Square massacre strong  Mr. Trump said that strong doesnt mean good, adding that he was not endorsing the massacre.Putin is a strong leader, absolutely, he said. I dont say that in a good way or a bad way. I say that as a fact. Mr. Kasich, asked a follow-up question, was swift in his rebuke: I think the Chinese government butchered those kids, he said. Does Mr. Trump share some culpability for encouraging the hostile tone at his rallies, which in recent weeks have turned increasing violent, Mr. Tapper asked.I hope not, I truly hope not, Mr. Trump said. But, he said, when his supporters see protesters, when they see whats going on in this country, they have anger thats unbelievable. And, he added, We have some protesters who are bad dudes and are really dangerous. There are only two of us who have a path to winning the nomination  Donald and myself, Mr. Cruz said, responding to a question about the possibility of a brokered convention, and noting that he has finished ahead of Mr. Trump in eight states. He then appealed to voters, saying that if Mr. Trump is the nominee, Hillary Clinton will win in November and urging, Come and join us.But Mr. Trump also returned to the numbers. What Mr. Cruz doesnt mention, he said, is that he has actually beaten Mr. Cruz far more frequently  in 13 states.'

aS'LANSING, Mich.  As voters in Michigan go to the polls on Tuesday, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio is getting some help from Mitt Romney, who recorded a get-out-the-vote call for Mr. Kasichs campaign.Mr. Romney spoke out forcefully last week against Donald J. Trump, and he also recorded a phone message for Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who, like Mr. Kasich, is trying to cut into Mr. Trumps support. Mr. Romneys calls are going to Republican voters in Michigan and the three other states voting on Tuesday: Mississippi, Idaho and Hawaii.Mr. Romneys father, George Romney, was Michigans governor, and Mr. Kasich has put significant effort into the state, which borders Ohio. He held a rally at a brewery in Lansing on Tuesday, then planned to return to Ohio, where he will spend primary night.The call recorded by Mr. Romney on Mr. Kasichs behalf is virtually identical to the one he recorded for Mr. Rubio. It focuses on undermining Mr. Trump, rather than making a case for Mr. Kasich.These are critical times that demand a serious, thoughtful commander in chief, Mr. Romney says in the message. If we Republicans were to choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future would be greatly diminished, and Im convinced Donald Trump would lose to Hillary Clinton.Asked if he agreed with Mr. Romneys assertion about how the countrys future would be affected by Mr. Trump being the nominee, Mr. Kasich put some distance between himself and the phone message.Governor Romneys kind of recording robocalls for everyone, and I didnt want somebody to think that he favored one person over me, because he doesnt, Mr. Kasich told reporters after the rally in Lansing. So, you know, its his words. I dont write his scripts.Reminded that his own campaign paid for the calls, he responded, We want to make sure people dont think that Romneys for somebody else and not for me, particularly in the state of Michigan.So is this the scenario that I would have liked to have had it work out like this? Not really, he added. But it is what it is.'

aS'Following is a transcript of the Democratic debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.COOPER: And welcome to The Whiting Auditorium on the campus of the Flint Cultural Center in Flint, Michigan for a special CNN democratic presidential debate.COOPER: Im Anderson Cooper. I want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world. Tonights debate will be seen on CNN, CNN International, CNN en Espanol, by American soldiers, sailors, and airmen on the American Forces Network, and nationwide on the Westwood One Radio Network.And now we want to welcome the Democratic candidates for president of the United States, please welcome Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Please welcome former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Ladies and gentlemen, the Democratic candidates for president of the United States!(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Before we begin tonight, we want to take a moment to remember former first lady Nancy Reagan. As probably know she passed away this morning at the age of 94. Her grace and elegance in the White House, her deep love for President Reagan, and her strength and advocacy in the fight against Alzheimers and drug abuse will always be remembered. We would like to pause of a moment of silence in honor of Mrs. Reagan.And now will you please rise for our national anthem performed by the Flint City Wide Choir, conducted by Darnell Ishmel. (MUSIC PLAYING, THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER)(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Our thanks to the Flint City Wide Choir.Candidates take your positions behind the podium. Before we begin as the candidates take their positions, I just want to set out some ground rules as moderators, Ill ask questions, Ill ask follow- ups and guide the discussion. The candidates will have one minute and 15 seconds to answer questions. Theyll have 30 seconds for follow- ups. CNNs Don Lemon will join me in the questioning, as will members of our audience here tonight. The members of our audience are Democrats and independents from Flint and elsewhere in Michigan. Weve reviewed their questions just so they dont overlap.COOPER: Now weve come to Flint because this is a city in crisis, a city where, as you probably know, the tap water is toxic. Public servants, public institutions not only failed to prevent the crisis, their decisions created this crisis. The state of Michigan, in an effort to save money, switched Flints water source to a cheaper, but riskier alternative, the Flint River. Safeguards were ignored. That river water corroded residential pipes, and for nearly two years, lead leaked into the water used in peoples homes. Now, for much of that time, the state downplayed the danger, even in the face of growing complaints and physical evidence.For 100 days, the federal government knew about it, and yet in all that time nobody told the people of Flint. They bathed in the water, they drank it, and so did their kids. Even today, lead is still present in some of the water.Tonight the Democratic candidates are here to answer questions about what they would do for Flint, as well as about other issues facing their country right now.Each candidate has one minute for an opening statement, Senator Sanders is first. We begin with him. Senator Sanders?SANDERS: Anderson, thank you very much.Over the last several weeks I had the opportunity to meet with a number of residents of Flint at a town meeting in Flint, and I have to tell you what I heard, and what I saw literally shattered me. And, it was beyond belief that children in Flint, Michigan in the United States of America in the year 2016 are being poisoned.That is clearly not what this country should be about.As Anderson indicated, theres a lot of blame to go around, and one of the points that I have made is that I believe the Governor of this state should understand that his dereliction of duty was irresponsible. He should resign.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: But more importantly, what is happening in Flint to a lesser degree is happening throughout this country. In recent years we have seen a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires, and increase in income and wealth inequality, and all over this country middle class families are struggling. Cities and towns are struggling, in order to provide basic services. Among many other things, we need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, our water systems, our waste water plants, our roads and our bridges. The wealthiest country in the history of the world has got to get its priorities right, take care of the people, no more tax breaks for billionaires.COOPER: Thank you, Senator.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, Ill start by saying amen to that.(APPLAUSE)We are here in Flint, Im very grateful that my request that we hold this debate be held here so we can continue to shine a very bright spotlight on what has happened in this city.I agree, the Governor should resign, or be recalled...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: ... support the efforts of citizens attempting to achieve that. But, that is not enough. We have to focus on what must be done to help the people of Flint.I support a hundred percent the efforts by your senators and members of congress to get the money from the federal government in order to begin the work that must occur to fix the infrastructure. The state should also be sending money immediately to help this city.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)CLINTON: I know the state of Michigan has a rainy day fund for emergencies, what is more important than the health and wellbeing of the people, particularly children? It is raining lead in Flint, and the state is derelict in not coming forward with the money that is required.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: And, well get to what we need to do to help the children and the people when I have a little more time because thats just as important as fixing the pipes.COOPER: Were going to have a lot of time for that. We want to begin tonight with the people of Flint themselves. This is Mikki Wade, shes a public housing program manager, and the mother of two kids. She says shes currently undecided, and has a question that both of you will be able to weigh in on. Ms. Wade?QUESTION: The water has impacted our lives in such a way that living comfortably in our home isnt the same anymore. The constant drives to pick up water just so my children can wash their hair, to wash our fruits and vegetables, and to brush our teeth is incredibly difficult. Once the pipes are replaced, Im not so sure I would be comfortable ever drinking the water.QUESTION: If elected president, what course will you take to regain my trust in the government?COOPER: Secretary Clinton, well begin with you.CLINTON: Well Nikki, its a very fair question.Your government at all levels have let you and your children and the people of Flint down. So I think that there are there several things. All the repair work that is being done  and Mayor Weaver program that we support to begin to help train people in Flint to be able to do this work to distribute the water. Everything that is done has to be triple checked to regain your trust and to hold those who are responsible for fixing the pipes and delivering the clean water which has you said, you bathe in it and drink it and wash food in it. You do everything with it.Every one of us should have to run through in our minds how we use water every single day to understand the pressures and the real pain that families are going through. So I will make sure as President that I double and triple check. I will work with elected officials who I trust like your mayor and like your senators and member of Congress so that we can assure you that when its fixed, you can trust it. You deserve nothing less.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, let me follow-up with that, he people here still wasnt drink the water in their homes as you well know. They cant bathe their kids in the water and they are desperate for accountability and specifics. As president can you give a specific about what you can do if you were president that would make Ms. Wades life better and life better for people here?CLINTON: Well, I support what President Obama is doing. He called for and got accountability from the officials at the EPA to make sure the state is doing its job. He expanded Medicaid for helping kids particularly to get the health care they need. He is also ordered that there be a Head Start program. I support that.When it comes to the water itself, we are supporting a program that Mayor Waver announced through Flint Waterworks to pay people in Flint, not outsiders, but people here to deliver the water while we are fixing the pipes. I would do even more of that. As president, what we were able to put together was a beginning. As president, I would concentrate resources on the city for economic development for more jobs as we fix the water and provide the health and education, interventions that children need. COOPER: Senator Sanders for Ms. Wade specifically?SANDERS: What is going is a disgrace beyond belief. As the president of the United States, this is what I would do is if local government does not have the resources  if state government for whatever reason America shouldnt be poisoned, federal government comes in, federal government acts.(APPLAUSE)What is absolute incredible to me is that water rates have soared in Flint. You are paying three times more for poison water than I am paying in Burlington, Vermont for clean water.First thing is you say, people are not paying a water bill for poison and that is retroactive.(APPLAUSE)Second of all, to ease anxiety, CDC has to come in and examine every child and adult in this community in terms of the amount of lead they may have. Thirdly, the wealthiest country has to rebuild the crumbling infrastructure, our water systems. I have a bill for a trillion dollars, it creates 13 million jobs rebuilding flint, Michigan and communities all over the country.COOPER: Thank you, senator.(APPLAUSE)We will have more on the infrastructure shortly but I want to follow up with you.This crisis in flint as you know, as everybody in the room knows was created by the government. Your policies are about expanding government. Why should people from flint trust that more government is the answer?SANDERS: Thats a good point, Anderson.Listen, I suppose they can trust the corporations who have destroyed Flint by a disastrous trade policy which have allowed them to shut down plants in flint and move to China or Mexico. We could trust them Im sure.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Or maybe  you know, maybe, Anderson, tell you what  we should  maybe we should let Wall Street come in and run the city of Flint...(APPLAUSE)... because we know their honesty and integrity has done so much for the American people. Look, we live in a democracy, and Im not in (ph) the last person to deny that government is failing in many respects.But at the end of the day, I will trust the people to create a government that works for them, rather than Wall Street or corporate America.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Secretary Clinton  Secretary Clinton, you  youve now both called for the governor to resign. I believe thats  thats new for you. Previously, you had not called for that, but youre calling for that tonight.Its easy to blame the Republican governor, Rick Snyder. But the federal government also dropped the ball here. According to Section 1414 of the Safe Drinking Water Act, the EPA has to step in and take action when a state is informed at (ph)  about water problems and doesnt do anything for 30 days, as the state here didnt do.The EPA knew for months and months, never warned the people of Flint not to drink the water. As president, would you fire the head of the EPA?CLINTON: Well, I think that the people here in the region, who knew about this and failed to follow what you just said, rightly, the law required, have been eliminated from the EPA.COOPER: So far, one person has resigned.CLINTON: I dont  well, I dont know how high it goes. I would certainly be launching an investigation. I think there is one. I was told that  you know, some of the higher-ups were pushing to get changes that were not happening.So I would have a full investigation, determine who knew what, when. And yes, people should be fired. How far up it went, I dont know. But as far as it goes, they should be relieved, because they failed this city.But let me just add this, Anderson. This is not the only place where this kind of action is needed. We have a lot of communities right now in our country where the level of toxins in the water, including lead, are way above what anybody should tolerate.(APPLAUSE)We have a higher rate of tested lead in people in Cleveland than in Flint. So Im not satisfied with just doing everything we must do for Flint. I want to tackle this problem across the board. And if people know about it and theyre not acting, and theyre in the government at any level, they should be forced to resign.COOPER: Senator Sanders, would a President Sanders fire the head of the EPA?(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: President Sanders would fire anybody who knew about what was happening and did not act appropriately.(APPLAUSE)And President Sanders would make the point that, how does it happen, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world? What are our priorities when, among others, Republicans today are fighting for hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the wealthiest people?How did we have so much money available to go to war in Iraq and spend trillions of dollars...(APPLAUSE)... but somehow not have enough money  not just for Flint, the secretary is right. There are communities all over this country  its not just infrastructure, it is education. Detroits public school system is collapsing.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Thank you  thank you, Senator.SANDERS: Anderson, the bottom line is, and what my campaign is, is changing our national priorities. We need a government that works for all of us...COOPER: Thank you, Senator.SANDERS: ... not just wealthy campaign contributors.COOPER: I want to go to Lee-Anne Walters. This is Lee-Anne Walters. She was one of the first people to report problems with the water in Flint. One of her twin boys stopped growing. Her daughter lost her hair.She says shes undecided, and has a question for both of you to answer, but well start with Senator Sanders. Ms. Walters?QUESTION: After my family, the city of Flint and the children in D.C. were poisoned by lead, will you make a personal promise to me right now that, as president, in your first 100 days in office, you will make it a requirement that all public water systems must remove all lead service lines throughout the entire United States, and notification made to the  the citizens that have said service lines.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: I will make a personal promise to you that the EPA and the EPA director that I appoint will make sure that every water system in the United States of America is tested, and that the people of those communities know the quality of the water that they are drinking, and that we are gonna have a plan to rebuild water systems in this country that are unsafe for drinking. COOPER: Let me just point out for accuracys sake, there is 10 million lead service pipes delivering water to people all across this country tonight. Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, I agree completely. I want to go further though. I want us to have an absolute commitment to getting rid of lead wherever it is because its not only in water systems, its also in soil, and its in lead paint that is found mostly in older homes. Thats why 500,000 children today have lead  lead in their bodies.So, I want to do exactly what you said. We will commit to a priority to change the water systems, and we will commit within five years to remove lead from everywhere.We were making progress on this in the 1990s. I worked with then Senator Obama to get more money, more support to do more to remove lead.COOPER: Thank you.CLINTON: That has, unfortunately, been in many ways, moved to a lower priority. I will elevate it, and I will do everything I can. Water, soil, and paint...COOPER: ... Thank you...CLINTON: ... Were going to get rid of it.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Thank you, Secretary. I want to go to my colleague, Don Lemon.LEMON: Anderson, thank you very much. Secretary Clinton, tonight you call for the resignation, or for Governor Snyder to be recalled. There are residents of this city who want to see criminal charges brought against those who are responsible. Do you think people should go to jail?CLINTON: Well, thats going to be up to the legal system, Don. I mean, I cant standing here  I dont have all the facts, but people should be held accountable wherever that leads. If it leads to resignation, or recall if youre in political office.If it leads to civil penalties, if it leads to criminal responsibility. There has to be an absolute accountability, and I will support whatever the outcome of those investigations are.LEMON: Senator Sanders, do you think people should go to jail?SANDERS: Well, I agree, you know? We cant sit up here  I cant sit up here and make judgment over whether or not somebody committed a criminal act. But, I will tell you this that after an investigation, if people, in fact, were found to have committed a criminal act  I talked to a mother.Imagine this for a second, imagine a mother who had a bright seven-year-old gregarious girl doing well in school. Two years later, that child is now in special education, intellectual capabilities significantly deteriorated. That is a crime against that child, and the people of Flint. And, clearly, people are going to have to be held accountable.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Secretary.I want to turn now to Bryn Mickle, the editor of the Flint Journal, hes our local partner in this debate. He has our next question.Bryn?QUESTION: Secretary Clinton, it took this water crisis for politicians like yourself to notice we are a city in trouble. Youve only both recently started talking about Flint, holding campaign events here in just the past few weeks. Secretary Clinton, youve even made the crisis a centerpiece of a new campaign ad. Why should the people of Flint believe that you arent just using this crisis to secure political points?CLINTON: Well, I think because throughout my public career I have been evening the odds for people in every way that I could. I started out with the Childrens Defense Fund, I worked throughout my time as a young lawyer as a person, an activist. Certainly, in Arkansas, then in the White House, to try to fix problems wherever I saw them.And, this problem is one that is particularly outrageous and painful at the same time.So, when I heard about it I immediately sent people here to find out what was going on. It was almost unbelievable. We have this problem in other places, but we dont say that it was actually caused by decisions made by public officials in positions of authority, as this one was.Then, when I talked to the mayor I basically said, What can I do to help?Then, when I came here, and I met with some of the mothers, and met their children, and heard their stories  Im just determined to do whatever I can. So, I have put together resources from the private and philanthropic communities to help provide a bridge because youve got to get the federal money, youve got to get the state money, but Im going to do everything I can. And, I will be with Flint all the way through this crisis in whatever capacity I am.And, if Im president, it will always be a priority for action from me.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Bryn has a follow up.QUESTION: Senator Sanders, how about you? Your first visit to Flint as a presidential candidate was just over a week ago. Thats almost five months after the people here were told to stop drinking the water. What took you so long?SANDERS: Well, first of all, thats not quite accurate. I was here long before that. I will you what I did. What I did was meet very quietly in Detroit with parents and others who were impacted by this disaster.And the second thing I did is hold a town meeting, which was as nonpolitical as I could make it for hundreds of people to tell me and the world through the media exactly what was happening here in Flint. I think the fear and the legitimate fear of the people of Flint is that a certain point the TV cameras and CNN will disappear.(APPLAUSE)And people are going to be left struggling in order to live in a safe and healthy community. All I can say is if you check my record going back a long time, I have stood with those who are hurting. I have stood with those who have no money, and I have taken on virtually every powerful special interest in the United States of America. Thats my record and Im proud of it.COOPER: Thank you, Senator.This city is also facing a jobs crisis, 75 percent of Flints manufacturing jobs have been lost in the last 25 years and about the same amount of time, Michigan lost 230,000 manufacturing jobs.I want to go to Tanisha Motron, she grew up in flint and now works in Detroit at the Shinola watch factory which as you know, is often held up as the blueprint for how to save American industry jobs. She says shes leaning towards secretary Clinton and has a question for her.QUESTION: A lot of members work in the auto industry here in Flint. Thats ultimately what I wanted to do when I got out of school unfortunately, I was unable to get any one of the big three and thats why I now reside at Shinola. If you are elected president, what are you going to do to in the United States instead of sending them overseas to other countries?COOPER: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Im going to do what I think will work which is both carrots and sticks. Let me talk about the carrots. Were going to have a very clear set of proposals and incentives for manufacturing so that we change the way that companies think about making investments again in America. I have a comprehensive manufacturing plan that I will be implementing.Were also going to invest more on infrastructure as we both have said, its woefully under resourced. That will put a lot of people to work. I want to do more to help small businesses, they are the source of two thirds of our jobs and we have to help them start and grow, particularly minority and women-owned small businesses.We need to do more to help create clean energy as a source of good jobs but I am also going to go after companies. You know, when a company decides to leave like Nabisco is leaving and they have gotten tax benefits from Chicago and Illinois to stay there, I will claw back the benefits. They will have to pay them back if they are leaving a place that actually invested in them.I am also going to go after companies like Johnson Controls in Wisconsin. They came and got part of the bailout because they were an auto parts supplier and now they want to move headquarters to Europe. They are going to have to pay an exit fee. We are going to stop this kind of job exporting and we are going to start importing and growing jobs again in our country.COOPER: Senator sanders, I will let you...SANDERS: I am very glad, Anderson, that secretary Clinton discovered religion on this issue but its a little bit too late.Secretary Clinton supported virtually every one of the disastrous trade agreements written by corporate America.(APPLAUSE)NAFTA, supported by the Secretary cost, us 800,000 jobs nationwide, tens of thousands of jobs in the Midwest. Permanent normal trade relations with China cost us millions of jobs. Look, I was on a picket line in early 1990s against NFATA because you didnt need a PhD in economics to understand that American workers should not be forced to compete against people in Mexico making 25 cents an hour.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: And the reason that I was one of the first, not one of the last to be in opposition to the TPP is that American workers...(APPLAUSE)... should not be forced to compete against people in Vietnam today making a minimum wage of $0.65 an hour. Look, what we have got to do is tell corporate America that they cannot continue to shut down. Weve lost 60,000 factories since 2001. Theyre going to start having to, if Im president, invest in this country  not in China, not in Mexico.COOPER: Secretary Clinton?(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well  well, Ill tell you something else that Senator Sanders was against. He was against the auto bailout. In January of 2009, President-Elect Obama asked everybody in the Congress to vote for the bailout.The money was there, and had to be released in order to save the American auto industry and four million jobs, and to begin the restructuring. We had the best year that the auto industry has had in a long time. I voted to save the auto industry.(APPLAUSE)He voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry. I think that is a pretty big difference.SANDERS: Well, I  If you are talking about the Wall Street bailout, where some of your friends destroyed this economy...CLINTON: You know...SANDERS: ... through  excuse me, Im talking.COOPER: Let him (ph) (inaudible).(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: If youre gonna talk, tell the whole story, Senator Sanders.SANDERS: Let me tell my story. You tell yours.CLINTON: I will.SANDERS: Your story is for  voting for every disastrous trade agreement, and voting for corporate America. Did I vote against the Wall Street bailout?When billionaires on Wall Street destroyed this economy, they went to Congress and they said, please, well be good boys, bail us out. You know what I said? I said, let the billionaires themselves bail out Wall Street. It shouldnt be the middle class of this country.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: OK, so...COOPER: Secretary Clinton?SANDERS: Wait a minute. Wait. Could I finish? Youll have your turn, all right?But ultimately, if you look at our records, I stood up to corporate America time and time again. I went to Mexico. I saw the lives of people who were working in American factories and making $0.25 an hour.I understood that these trade agreements were going to destroy the middle class of this country. I led the fight against us (sic). That is one of the major differences that we have.COOPER: Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Well, if I  if I could...(APPLAUSE)... to set the record straight, I voted against the only multinational trade agreement that came before me when I was in the Senate. It was called CAFTA. I came out against the TPP after it was finished. I thought it was reasonable to actually know what was in it before I opposed it. I oppose it.(APPLAUSE)Now let me get back to what happened in January of 2009. The Bush administration negotiated the deal. Were there things in it that I didnt like? Would I have done it differently? Absolutely.But was the auto bailout money in it  the $350 billion that was needed to begin the restructuring of the auto industry? Yes, it was. So when I talk about Senator Sanders being a one-issue candidate, I mean very clearly  you have to make hard choices when youre in positions of responsibility. The two senators from Michigan stood on the floor and said, we have to get this money released. I went with them, and I went with Barack Obama. You did not. If everybody had voted the way he did, I believe the auto industry would have collapsed, taking four million jobs with it.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Senator Sanders?SANDERS: I believe that the recklessness, the greed, and the illegal behavior of Wall Street drove this country into the worst economic downturn in the history of the United  modern history of the United States of America. And I will be damned if it was the working people of this country who had to bail out the crooks on Wall Street.(APPLAUSE)And what I proposed  and I had an amendment that was defeated  it was defeated by a voice vote on the floor of the Senate  that said to those people on the top who benefited from Wall Street greed  I said, you pay for the bailout. Dont go to my constituents, who are struggling to make ends meet.In terms of the auto bailout, of course that made sense. In terms of the stimulus package, of course that made sense, and I strongly supported President Obamas position on that.SANDERS: But let us be clear, one of the major issues Secretary Clinton says Im a one-issue person, well, I guess so. My one issue is trying to rebuild a disappearing middle class. Thats my one issue.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Senator Sanders...CLINTON: Well, all I can say is that given the terrible pressures that the auto industry was under and that the middle class of this state and Ohio and Indiana and Illinois and Wisconsin and Missouri and other places in the Midwest were facing, I think it was the right decision to heed what President-elect Obama asked us to do.He sent a letter, an authorized letter, asking us to support that to save the auto industry. Yes, were there things in it that you and I would not have necessarily wanted? Thats true. But when it came down to it, you were either for saving the auto industry or you were against it. I voted to save the auto industry. And I am very glad that I did.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Let me just say this, while we are on Wall Street, one of us has a super PAC. One of us has raised $15 million from Wall Street for that super PAC. One of us has given speeches on Wall Street for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Now, I kind of think if you get paid a couple hundred thousand dollars for a speech, it must be a great speech. I think we should release it and let the American people see what that transcript was.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: And I have said and I will say again, I will be happy to release anything I have as long as everybody else does too, because what really is behind that question, Republicans and Democrats, is where I can stand up to Wall Street.Well, lets have some facts instead of some rhetoric for a change. I went to Wall Street when I was a United States senator. I told them they were wrecking the economy. I asked for a moratorium on foreclosures. I asked that we do more to try to prevent what I worried was going to happen. I also called for closing loopholes including the carried interest loophole. I also called for changes in CEO pay. I have a record. And you know what, if you were going to be in some way distrusted or dismissed about whether you can take on Wall Street if you ever took money, President Obama took more money from Wall Street in the 2008 campaign than anybody ever had.And when it came time to stand up to Wall Street, he passed and signed the toughest regulation since the Great Depression with the Dodd-Frank regulations.COOPER: Senator Sanders, just yesterday, in fact, you said just  I believe it was yesterday you said not only her speech must have been a fantastic speech, it must have been a Shakespearean speech for that amount of money. Is her answer enough for you that she will release it when all the Republicans and Democrats do? SANDERS: All right, look, Secretary Clinton wants everybody else to release it, well, Im your Democratic opponent, I release it, here it is. There aint nothing. I dont give speeches to Wall Street for hundreds of thousands of dollars, you got it.Second of all, when we talk about being tough on Wall Street, and this galls me and the American people. Recently Goldman Sachs, among many other major financial institutions on Wall Street, as you know, reached a settlement with the federal government for $5 billion because they were selling worthless packages of subprime mortgages, $5 billion settlement.You know how many people, executives on Wall Street have gone to jail? If you are a kid caught with marijuana in Michigan, you get a police record. If you are an executive on Wall Street that destroys the American economy, you pay a $5 billion fine, no police record.If I am elected president, we are going to bring justice back to a broken criminal justice system.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, I think we are in vigorous agreement on this. I have said repeatedly no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail. And I have said that I would use the tools in the Dodd-Frank regulations, that if any bank posed a systemic risk to the economy, they would be broken up.Because we now have tools, laws that we didnt have before. And I am very happy we did. Because there does need to be accountability, including criminal accountability if it is called for.COOPER: Senator Sanders, I just want to show the audience, you sent a tweet, I want to return to trade.You sent a tweet on Thursday, this is the tweet, Im showing it to viewers. It says the people of Detroit know the real costs of Hillary Clintons free trade policies. It shows pictures of crumbling buildings. It seems like youre blaming her for the situation in Detroit.SANDERS: Well, Im blaming the trade policies. You know what? This is an amazing thing which I didnt know until recently, and I wonder how many people did know this.COOPER: But, youre calling them Hillary Clintons failed trade policies.SANDERS: Well, Hillary Clinton, and everybody else who supported these disastrous trade policies. She wasnt alone. We have many, many Republicans and far too many Democrats who supported these disastrous trade policies.Do you know...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: ... Do you know that in 1960 Detroit Michigan was one of the wealthiest cities in America? Flint, Michigan was a prosperous city, but then what happened is corporate America said why do I want to pay somebody in Michigan a living wage when I can pay slave wages in Mexico or China? Were going to shut down, were going to move abroad, were going to bring those products back into this country.Those trade policies, as much as any other set of policies, has resulted in the shrinking of the American middle class. And, Ill tell you what else it did. Its not only job loss by the millions, it is the race to the bottom so that new jobs in manufacturing, in some cases today, pay 50 percent less than they did 20 years ago. How stupid is that trade policy?(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: You know, if were going to argue about the 1990s instead of talking about the future, which Id much prefer because I think every election is about the future, and you all deserve to know what we will do to help you have a brighter future  but, if we are going to talk about the 1990s I think its only fair to say that at the end of the 1990s, after two terms of my husbands presidency, the unemployment rate in Michigan was 4.4 percent.There had been a net increase of 54,000 manufacturing jobs. There had been a net increase of 653,000 jobs overall.And, one of the ways jobs were brought to, and grown here in Michigan was through something called the Export-Import Bank which helped a lot of businesses, particularly small businesses, be able to export around the world.Senator Sanders opposes that. I think were in a race for exports. I think China, Germany, everybody else supports their businesses. Here in Michigan theres been $11 billion dollars in recent years used to support exports, primarily from small businesses.I favor that, hes opposed it. I want to do everything I can for us to compete and win in the global economy...COOPER: ... Senator Sanders...CLINTON: ... and thats what I will do as president...COOPER: ... I just want to explain to viewers what the Export- Import Bank is, in case everybody is not quite as wonkish as everybody on this stage here.The Export-Import Bank, its a federal agency, it gives loans to companies that export American products. Senator Sanders, you do oppose it. The vast majority of the banks customers are small businesses, 176 right here in Michigan. What do you say to small business owners....SANDERS: ... Ill tell you what I say...COOPER: ... Who rely on the banks to make their company profitable...SANDERS: ... Ill tell you what I say. Do you know what the other name of the Export-Import Bank is? What its called in Washington? Its called the bank of Boeing because Boeing itself gets 40 percent of the money discharged by the Export-Import Bank.Seventy-Five percent of the funds going from the federal government, the Export-Import Bank, goes to large, profitable corporations. Many of these corporations have shut down in America, and have gone abroad to exploit poor people.You know what? I dont think its a great idea for the American taxpayer to have to subsidize through corporate welfare profitable corporations who downsize in the United States of America.COOPER: Senator...SANDERS: ... Seventy-Five percent of that money goes to large profitable corporations.COOPER: Senator Sanders, you are the only member of the Democratic caucus to vote against it. Youre agreeing with Senator Ted Cruz on this, why is he right and the Democrats wrong?SANDERS: Well, let me tell you, I dont want to break the bad news.(LAUGHTER)SANDERS: Democrats are not always right. Democrats have often supported corporate welfare...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Democrats have supported disastrous trade agreements, but on this issue I do not believe in corporate welfare, and in fact, secretary Clinton may know or not know, but as a member of the Financial Services Committee, I worked hard and successfully to make sure that at least 20 percent of the money went to small businesses which is where it should go and not to profitable corporations and downsizing in our country.COOPER: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: When I traveled around the world on you behalf as Secretary of State and went to 112 countries, one thing I saw everywhere was how European and Asian countries were supporting their companies back in their countries, to be able to make sales and contracts in a lot of the rest of the world. In fact, without the export-import bank, supporting businesses of all sizes  I believe more jobs would be lost here at home and more jobs literally would be exported. Instead of exporting products, we would be exporting jobs.I just believe that Senator Sanders took that lonely position because most of us who saw the results  I saw it as a senator from New York. Your Senators saw it here in Michigan. They can give you the names of 240 companies in Michigan that have been helped.There is a company in Levonia being helped, there are companies all over this state. I know, if we are going to compete and win in the global economy, we cant let every other country support their companies and we take a hands off approach. I will not agree with that.COOPER: Im going to let you respond but I just want to push back on this. Senator Sanders is correct, the majority of the money does go Boeing, does go to companies like Caterpillar. Do they need this money?CLINTON: I will tell you what, Anderson, after I investigated it, I concluded they did and heres why. There two big plane manufacturers in the world, theres Airbus and Boeing. Airbus does everything it can to get contracts to sell planes everywhere in the world. We dont have as quite an aggressive outreach from our government.I did go in many places around the world to sell American products because the alternatives were usually European, Asian, primarily Chinese products. That to me was an unacceptable concession. So yes, Boeing and other big companies get support just like their competitors do from the companies that they are from in the countries that provide the support.COOPER: Thank you.Senator sanders?SANDERS: Isnt it tragic that the large multinational corporations making billions of dollars a year, shutting down in America, going to China, going to Mexico? Absolutely they need a handout from the American middle class  I dont think so.Second of all.(APPLAUSE)Second of all, secretary Clinton traveled the world, she has been to Europe. And lets talk about Europe versus the United States. Im sure that when you were in Europe, and France, and Germany and the U.K., and all of the other countries; you noticed something and that is every one of those countries guarantees health care to all of their people as a right.(APPLAUSE)And I am sure you know as you know you do that in countries like the U.K. compared to America, we are spending almost three times as much as they spend in the U.K. for health care for our people. We are spending 50 percent more than the French. When we talk about Europe and their pluses and minuses, one thing they have done well that we should emulate and that is guaranteed health care for all people for a better care for all.COOPER: Thank you, Senator Sanders. Secretary Clinton, 30 seconds and we have to take a break. So 30 seconds if you can.CLINTON: We are on the path to doing that thanks to President Obama and the Affordable Care Act, we have 90 percent coverage. We are lacking 10 percent. We are going to stay on that and get to 100 percent universal coverage.COOPER: We have to take a break. We will continue this discussion. We have a lot more to talk about. We will take a short break. We have more of the Presidential Democratic Debate from Flint, Michigan when we come back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)COOPER: And welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential debate, live here in Flint, Michigan. We want to continue the discussion now  were gonna turn to the subject of crime.As most of you know, two weeks ago, an Uber driver in Kalamazoo, which is two hours from where we are tonight, went on a shooting rampage, killing six people, injuring two people.One of the injured was a 14-year-old girl. Her name is Abigail Kopf. She was shot in the head, her heart stopped, she was on life support  looked like she might  might not make it. But amazingly, Abigail pulled through. Her father...(APPLAUSE)... her father Gene Kopf is here tonight. And I know, Gene, you have a question. But before you ask your question, I just want to ask, how is Abigail doing tonight?QUESTION: She is now laughing and giggling, but she has a long road of physical recovery.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: I should point out you are leaning toward Senator Sanders, but I know you have a question that applies to both candidates. Well first toss it to Secretary Clinton. Whats your question?QUESTION: The United States has had a rash of mass shootings over the years  42 shootings in the United States this year alone. The man who shot everyone, including my daughter, in Kalamazoo, had no mental health issues recorded, and had a clear background.What do you plan to do to address this serious epidemic? I dont want to hear anything about tougher laws for mental health or criminal backgrounds, because that doesnt work.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, first of all I am looking at your daughter and Im very grateful that she is laughing and she is on a road to recovery. But it never should have happened. You know, on average, 90 people a day are killed by gun violence in our country.I think we have to try everything that works to try to limit the numbers of people and the kinds of people who are given access to firearms. The Brady Bill, which has been in effect now for about 23 years, has kept more than two million purchases from going forward. So we do have to continue to try to work on that because not every killer will have the same profile.But the comprehensive background checks, closing the gun show loophole, closing the online loophole, closing whats called the Charleston loophole, where you get a gun at the end of three days, even if the background check is not completed which is what the killer in Charleston did. And then they found out later, he shouldnt have gotten the gun when he killed nine people at Mother Emmanuel Church.I also believe, so strongly Gene (ph), that giving immunity to gunmakers and sellers was a terrible mistake.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Because it removed any accountability from the makers and the sellers. And it also disrupted what was a very promising legal theory, to try to get makers to do more to make guns safer for example. To try to give sellers more accountability for selling guns when they shouldnt have. So that is an issue that Senator Sanders and I differ on, I voted against giving them immunity, but I think we should very seriously move to repeal that and go back to making sure gun makers and sellers are like any other business. They can be held accountable.And then I do think we have got to have a public...QUESTION: Thank you.CLINTON: Well, weve got to have a public discussion, because we have created a culture in which people grab for guns all the time.COOPER: Thank you. CLINTON: And there has got to be a way to have more warning signals and more efforts to try to stop that from happening like with the man who shot your daughter.COOPER: I want to go to Senator Sanders.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Senator Sanders?SANDERS: I remember President Obama being on television maybe three months ago. Showed the secretary members as well. She knows the president, I know the president. And he is generally speaking in public and hes not a very emotional guy. And he  after the mass killing in Oregon if my memory is correct, he said look. There  to be honest with you, lets be honest. Nobody has a magic solution to this problem.Any lunatic tomorrow, any person can walk into a theater and do something horrific. And you know what? For us to tell you that that absolutely will not happen would be untrue. But what the president said, he said look, this is a tough issue. But we have got to do everything we possibly can to minimize the possibility of these mass killings.You are looking at a guy who comes from a rural state with no gun control. I have a D minus voting record from the NRA. You are looking at a guy who in 1988 lost a statewide election for Congress because I was the only candidate who said you know what, I dont think its a great idea in this country to be selling military-style assault weapons which are designed to kill people.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: I lost that election by three votes. I agree with what the secretary said. We need to expand and improve the instant background checks. Bottom line is people who should not have guns in America should not be able to buy guns in America.COOPER: Senator Sanders, Secretary Clinton mentioned the so- called Charleston loophole. What she is calling the Charleston loophole. Is that something, if you were president, you would you work to extend that three day?SANDERS: Absolutely, I agree. Look, that bill had some sensible provisions in it. It had the banning of bullets that pierce policemens armor. Is that a good thing? I think we would want to get rid of that. particular legislation had safety locks on guns so the kids do not pick them up and shoot them. That bill had bad things in it. What I have said...COOPER: So you would want a longer than three days waiting period?SANDERS: Absolutely. That was a very arbitrary decision. What that real debate was about, as you may or may not know, was about how long it would take for the instant background check to go into effect. I wanted that instant background check to go into effect as soon as possible. That was the most important part of that bill.COOPER: Secretary Clinton  actually, Senator Sanders, let me continue to follow-up, because Secretary Clinton mentioned the liability.Right now, families of Sandy Hook victims announced that they are going to sue Remington, who made the AR-15 which was used in the Newtown massacre.(APPLAUSE)Now, they believe  those families believe that  that Remington, the distributors, the sellers  should be held legally responsible for how that gun  how their product is used.Now, the lawsuit may not go anywhere because of the bill you voted for  legislation that prevents gun makers from being sued. Tonight, what do you say to those families?SANDERS: Well, this is what I say, if I understand it  and correct me if Im wrong. If you go to a gun store and you legally purchase a gun, and then, three days later, if you go out and start killing people, is the point of this lawsuit to hold the gun shop owner or the manufacturer of that gun liable?If that is the point, I have to tell you I disagree. I disagree because you hold people  in terms of this liability thing, where you hold manufacturers liability is if they understand that theyre selling guns into an area that  its getting into the hands of criminals, of course they should be held liable.But if they are selling a product to a person who buys it legally, what youre really talking about is ending gun manufacturing in America. I dont agree with that.COOPER: Secretary Clinton?(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well, that  that is not  that is not what happened, and I think its important for people to understand.Because of the proliferation of guns, because of the epidemic of gun violence in our country, there were a group of cities, states, and other concerned people who, in the late 90s and in the early 2000s, were working on legal theories that they thought would force gun makers to do more to make guns safer and force sellers to be much more responsible.The NRA saw this happening, and they said, weve got to stop it. Last thing in the world we want is to have guns that you can only shoot with your fingerprint, or to have guns with such strong safety locks on them that they may not be sellable.So the NRA went to the Congress, and the head of the NRA has said this was the most important NRA legislation in more than 20 years...COOPER: Secretary...CLINTON: ... and they basically went to the Congress  I was there.COOPER: ... Secretary...CLINTON: I was in the Senate. And they said, give us absolute immunity. No other industry in America has absolute immunity...(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: ...and they sell products all the time that cause harm...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: So lets say this. Lets say this.CLINTON: ... and theyre held responsible.COOPER: Senator Sanders.SANDERS: If I understand  and  you know, as I understand it, what youre really talking about is not what Secretary Clinton is responding to.As I understand it  and maybe Im wrong on this, but what you were essentially saying, and what people are saying, is that, if somebody who is crazy or a criminal or a horrible person goes around shooting people, the manufacturer of that gun should be held liable.And if that is your position, then what you are saying, essentially  if that is the case, as I understand it  its not what Secretary Clinton is talking about. I agree with what she said.But if that is the case, then essentially, your position is there should not be any guns in America, period.(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: That is like the NRA position. No.SANDERS: Can I  can I finish, please? All right?And you can  there are people who hold that view. And thats fine, if you hold it. I think what you do is you hold those people who have used the gun accountable. You try to make...COOPER: Were gonna move on.SANDERS: ... guns as safe as possible, but I would disagree on that.COOPER: Were gonna move on. Dawn (ph)...CLINTON: Anderson, I just want to finish, because this  I know some of the parents from Sandy Hook. I want people in this audience to think about what it must feel like to send off your first grader, little backpack, maybe, on his or her back, and then the next thing you hear is that somebody has come to that school using an automatic weapon, an AR-15, and murdered those children.Now, they are trying to prevent that from happening to any other family.SANDERS: Hold...CLINTON: And the best way to do that is to go right at the people...COOPER: Senator Sanders...CLINTON: ... you talk about corporate greed?SANDERS: Hold it.CLINTON: The gun manufacturers sell guns to make as much money as they can make. (APPLAUSE)COOPER: Senator Sanders.SANDERS: You know, I think it is a little bit  it is a little bit  look, what happened at Sandy Hook, what happened in Michigan, what has happened far too often all over this country is a terrible, terrible tragedy, and we have got to do everything we can, as I mentioned a moment ago, to end these mass killings.But, as I understand what your question is  and, youre not the only person whose heart was broken. I know, I was there in the Senate when we learned about this killing. It is almost unspeakable to talk about some lunatic walking into a  I mean; it is hard to even talk about it.We all feel that way. But it, as I understand it, Anderson, and maybe Im wrong, what youre really talking about is people saying lets end gun manufacturing in America. Thats the implications of that, and I dont agree with that.COOPER: Were going to move on. Don Lemon?LEMON: Alright, thank you very much, Anderson.As a black man in America, if I were born today Id have a one in three chance of ending up in prison in my life. Secretary Clinton, on the campaign trail, you are calling for an end to the era of mass incarceration, but a lot of folks in the black community blame the 1994 Crime Bill, a bill you supported for locking up a generation of black men.Given whats happened since 1994, why should black people trust you to get it right this time?CLINTON: Well, Dont, let me say this, Senator Sanders voted for that bill, we both supported it. And, I think its fair to say we did because back then there was an outcry over the rising crime rate, and people from all communities were asking that action be taken.Now, my husband said at the NAACP last summer that it solved some problems, but it created other problems, and I agree. And, one of those problems was, unfortunately, a move to expand the reasons why people would be incarcerated, not just at the federal level which is what this bill about, but in states and localities as well. And, thats why the very first speech that I gave in this campaign was about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration because I believe absolutely that too many families were broken up, too many communities were adversely affected. So, weve got to do a bunch of things.On the criminal justice side, look, weve got to have better policing. That means body cameras, that means ending profiling, that means doing everything we can to make sure theres respect between the community and the police.And, when it comes to incarceration...LEMON: But, Secretary...CLINTON: ... That means we have to limit mandatory minimums, we have to end disparities and treatment at last through (ph) incarceration...LEMON: The question is why should black people trust you this time to get it right? Thats the question.CLINTON: Well, Senator Sanders voted for it as well. Are you going to ask him the same question?SANDERS: Probably will.LEMON: Do you think your support  your husband has said that this bill was a mistake. Do you think it was a mistake?CLINTON: I just said that. He said at the NAACP that there were some aspects that worked well. The violence against women provisions have worked well, for example. But, other aspects of it were a mistake and I agree. Thats why Im focused, and have a very comprehensive approach toward fixing the criminal justice system, going after systemic racism that stalks the criminal justice system, ending private prisons, ending the incarceration of low-level offenders, and I am committed to doing that.(APPLAUSE)LEMON: And, Senator Sanders, before you respond, I want to ask you this. Back in 1994, heres what you warned, we are dooming tens of millions of young people to a future of bitterness, mystery, hopelessness, drugs, crime, and violence, but you voted for the bill anyway. Was your vote a mistake?SANDERS: You know, as I think Secretary Clinton knows, as we all know, there are bills in congress that have bad stuff, there are bills in congress that have good stuff. Good stuff and bad stuff in the same bill.Now, if I have voted against that bill, Secretary Clinton would be here tonight and shed say, Bernie Sanders voted against the ban on assault weapons. Bernie Sanders voted against the violence against women act. Those were provisions in the bill, as the Secretary just indicated. So, in that bill there was some good provisions, I have been a fierce fighter against domestic violence ever since I was mayor in Burlington.Violence against women act has protected millions of women in this country, it was in that bill. The ban on assault weapons, thats what I have fought for my whole life. It was in that bill.Now, what you are reading though is I went to the floor, as I recall, and thats what I said. I tried to get the death penalty aspects in that bill out. Secretary Clinton have a disagreement. I was then, and I am now opposed to the death penalty.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: So, to answer your question, what you read was a congressman who was torn, who said there are good things in that bill, there are bad things overall. I voted for it.But where we are right now is having more than 2.2 million people in jail  more than any other country on earth. This is a campaign promise, at the end of my first term, we will not have more people in jail than any other country.COOPER: Thank you very much. I want to go to David Mcghee. David Mcghee runs a youth development program director and he is undecided, but his question is for Senator Sanders. David?QUESTION: We live in a diverse nation. Opportunities to lead however to be frank, are often at the feet at older Caucasian men and women.SANDERS: You are not talking about me, are you?(LAUGHTER)QUESTION: Men more so than women. However, what experiences do you have that have helped you deeply understand the mind sets and values of other cultures?SANDERS: Well, I think the best answer  I dont know that I can give you a definitive answer here, but I will give you this answer. When I was a young man at the University of Chicago, I worked with fellow black and white students trying to desegregate the University of Chicago owned housing. Most candidates for president, dont put this on their resume, but I was arrested by the Chicago police for trying to desegregate the Chicago school system.(APPLAUSE)In 1963, and an important day for me, I went to the march on Washington led by Dr. King for jobs and freedom. Dr. King has been an important inspiration for me. In this campaign, if you go toberniesanders.com and read our position on criminal justice, it is I believe the strongest position of any candidate. What it says among other things, 51 percent of African-American kids today are unemployed  you know were going to do? Were going to provide education and jobs for those kids, not jails or incarceration. COOPER: In a speech about policing, the FBI director borrowed a phrase from Avenue Q saying, everybody is a little racist. So on a personal front, what racial blind spots do you have?CLINTON: Let me go answer Mr. Mcghees question because I think its a profound one.I think the most important that happened to me was a combination of my church and youth minister when I was a teenager, insisting that we go in to inner-city Chicago because I lived in a suburb and have exchanges with kids in black and hispanic churches. It was also important for me to be a baby-sitter for the children of migrant workers and to learn more about their lives, and to hear Dr. King speak in Chicago when I was about 14 years old. That got me thinking about what I needed to do to try to fulfill my faith.When I was in law school, I had the opportunity to mead a visionary woman, named Mary Right Adelman, who worked with Dr. King who was the first African-American woman who passed the Mississippi bar. I asked her for a job and she said she didnt have any money. I was working my way through law school and she said if I could get a job and get myself paid, she would give me a job. So I got law students a Civil Rights Research Council Grant.The first thing she did was send me to look at South Carolina, to investigate juveniles being sent to adult jails. The second thing she did was to send me to Alabama to investigate segregated academies. So from that moment until today, I am so grateful for my experiences as a very young woman driven by my church and my experiences working for the Childrens Defense Fund which have given me some insight and have lit a fire inside me to do everything I can to address systemic racism.LEMON: I want to ask both of you this question. I appreciate you responding to that question, but I want to ask both of you again. In a speech about policing, the FBI director James Comey borrowed a phrase saying, everyone is a little bit racist. What racial blind spot do you have? Secretary, you first.CLINTON: Well, Don, if I could, I think being a white person in the United States of America, I know that I have never had the experience that so many people, the people in this audience have had. And I think its incumbent upon me and what I have been trying to talk about during this campaign is to urge white people to think about what it is like to have the talk with your kids, scared that your sons or daughters, even, could get in trouble for no good reason whatsoever like Sandra Bland and end up dead in a jail in Texas.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: And I have spent a lot of time with the mothers of African-American children who have lost them, Trayvon Martins mother. And Ive gotten to know them. Ive listened to them. And it has been incredibly humbling because I cant pretend to have the experience that you have had and others have had. But I will do everything that I possibly can to not only do the best to understand and to empathize, but to tear down the barriers of systemic racism that are in the criminal justice system, in the employment system, in the education and health care system.That is what I will try to do to deal with what I know is the racism that still stalks our country.(APPLAUSE)LEMON: Thank you, Secretary.Senator Sanders, on a personal front, what racial blind spots do you have?SANDERS: Well, let me just very briefly tell you a story. When I was in one of my first years in Congress, I went to a meeting downtown in Washington, D.C. And I went there with another congressman, an African-American congressman. And then we kind of separated during the meeting. And then I saw him out later on. And he was sitting there waiting and I said, well, lets go out and get a cab. How come you didnt go out and get a cab?He said, no, I dont get cabs in Washington, D.C. This was 20 years ago. Because he was humiliated by the fact that cabdrivers would go past him because he was black. I couldnt believe, you know, you just sit there and you say, this man did not take a cab 20 years ago in Washington, D.C. Tell you another story, I was with young people active in the Black Lives Matter movement. A young lady comes up to me and she says, you dont understand what police do in certain black communities. You dont understand the degree to which we are terrorized, and Im not just talking about the horrible shootings that we have seen, which have got to end and weve got to hold police officers accountable, Im just talking about every day activities where police officers are bullying people.So to answer your question, I would say, and I think its similar to what the secretary said, when youre white, you dont know what its like to be living in a ghetto. You dont know what its like to be poor. You dont know what its like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car.And I believe that as a nation in the year 2016, we must be firm in making it clear. We will end institutional racism and reform a broken criminal justice system.(APPLAUSE)LEMON: Thank you, Senator Sanders. Senator Sanders, a CNN poll found that 64 percent of Americans felt like race relations got worse over the last decade. You have said they would absolutely be better under a Sanders presidency.So how would you be more effective in tackling racial issues than President Barack Obama?SANDERS: Its not a question of being better than President Obama, it is a question of building on the work that President Obama has done, the very important work.(APPLAUSE)LEMON: You said absolutely, though, in an answer.SANDERS: No, well, he has given us a good, good basis and foundation. We have got to do better than that. And of course we should.But heres what I would do. I would end  I would make sure that the Department of Justice investigated every killing of a citizen of this country when they are under apprehension from a police officer or when they are killed in police custody.I would end the militarization of local police departments.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: I would develop model programs to make police departments look like the communities that they serve. I would end minimal sentencing and give judges more discretion. I would recognize that substance abuse and drug addiction is a health issue, not a criminal issue.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: And I would make sure that those people who left jail had the education and job training so they dont go back into the same environment which got them in jail in the first place. (APPLAUSE)LEMON: Senator, thank you very much.Secretary Clinton, in 1996, you used the term super predators to describe some young kids. Some feel like it was racial code. Was it and were you wrong to use that term?CLINTON: Well, I was speaking about drug cartels and criminal activity that was very concerning to folks across the country. I think it was a poor choice of words, I never used it before, I havent used it since, I would not use it again.Because my whole life, to go back to what I was saying to Mr. Mcgee (ph), is, you know, really, ever since I went to work for the Childrens Defense Fund, is to try to figure out ways to even the odds for people that are left out and left behind.And I know very well that we have too many kids in our country right now who are living in poverty, who are going to schools like the ones in Detroit that have mold and rodents in them. I saw that in South Carolina. Its unfortunately across America. So what we have got to do is provide more opportunities earlier in the lives of every child.Thats why I believe in supporting families, early childhood education, universal pre-kindergarten, help kids be successful. And here is Flint, weve got to do more to mitigate against the effects of lead, because too many kids are having the experiences Ive been told about, where theyre falling back in school, where they are having headaches because of the lead exposure.LEMON: Thank you.CLINTON: So were going to have to do even more here than we would do in most other counties.LEMON: Were going to talk about education in just a moment.SANDERS: But can I respond to that briefly?COOPER: Were...SANDERS: Just in this. I am not sure which legislation that was. But I think it may have been the Welfare Reform, so-called...CLINTON: No, it was the crime bill.SANDERS: Oh, it was the crime bill.CLINTON: Crime bill.SANDERS: But during that same period, 96. There was a bill called  so-called, it had a long title to it, Welfare Reform Bill. And this bill really was a bill that scapegoated the poorest people in this country. I strongly opposed that legislation. Secretary Clinton had a different position then.And what that legislation ended up doing is increasing extreme poverty, the poorest people in this country have become much poorer as a result of that  really a bill that was written by Republicans. Bad bill.LEMON: Thank you. Secretary Clinton, you were in, so 30 seconds.CLINTON: Well, once again, if were going to argue about the 90s, lets try to get the facts straight. That bill had a lot of provisions that unfortunately were stripped out by George W. Bush, by Republican governors. And I disagreed with the way it was applied. And I have a very clear set of ideas about what should be done to try to provide more support, including trying to cut poverty in half in the next years.But if we are going to talk about the 90s, lets talk about 23 million new jobs, incomes went up for everybody. The median African- American income went up 33 percent at the end of the 90s and we lifted more people out of poverty than at any other time in recent history.So we were on the right path. More jobs, rising incomes.LEMON: Senator Sanders.CLINTON: Along came George W. Bush and trickle down economics and brought us the Great Recession, which thank goodness President Obama has been digging us out of ever since.LEMON: Senator Sanders.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Secretary Clinton is right. In the 1990s, we created a whole lot of jobs. Good. And I supported many of your husbands initiatives. But in the 1990s, you know what we also did? We deregulated Wall Street, which allowed Wall Street to end up destroying our economy.(APPLAUSE)We passed NAFTA and other disastrous trade agreements which had a horrendous impact on African-Americans in particular, in Flint, in Detroit and all across this country. So when we talk about the 90s, youre right. A lot of good things happened, but a lot of bad things happened.LEMON: Thank you Senator.SANDERS: I voted against those trade agreements.LEMON: Thank you Senator.SANDERS: And I voted against Wall Street deregulation.COOPER: Thank you Senator. We have to take a short break. The Democratic presidential discussion and debate continues here from Flint in just a moment.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)COOPER: And welcome back. Welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential debate, here live in Flint, Michigan. Lets  lets move on to the subject of education.In nearby Detroit, the public schools have become a national symbol of neglect and failure. That school system is $3.5 billion in debt. Officials say they could run out of money by April.I want to bring in Shoniqua Kemp. Shes right here  Ms. Kemp. Her 14-year-old daughter Imani is a student in Detroit. Shoniqua is one of ten parents suing Detroit public schools  not for money, she says, but to improve conditions.She says shes currently leaning towards Senator Sanders. Her question will go to both of you, but well start with Senator Sanders. Ms. Kemp?QUESTION: Thank you. Speaking of opportunities for success, in Detroit, schools open and close with no accountability to  or transparency to the communities that it  they service.Not only that  in our schools, as youve stated, we have issues with rats, mold, no working water fountains, not to mention non- certified teachers, lack of accountability around transportation and special education, and so much more.QUESTION: With that said, our students can no longer suffer due to lack of these things, or having these dilapidated issues take place. So, my question is whos going to step up? Whos going to ensure that the policies procedures are put in place that will ensure, and bring forth a successful future for our students because my daughter cannot wait eight more years for success to take place at your hands. At the leaders hands.COOPER: Senator Sanders, lets start with you.SANDERS: Well, thank you very much for not being resigned to that horrendous situation, but being prepared to stand up and fight back...QUESTION: ... Thank you...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: ... Thats what we need all over this country.And, let me be very honest with you, hard thing to say, but it is true. A great nation is judged not by how many millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how it treats the most vulnerable amongst us, and that is the children, and that is the elderly. And, do you know what?We should be ashamed of how we treat our kids and our senior citizens.QUESTION: Thank you.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: We have a Republican leadership in congress now fighting for hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the top two-tenths of one percent, but somehow we cant come up with the money to fix Detroits crumbling public school system. Somehow we cannot make sure that Detroit has qualified, and good teachers.Somehow we cant make sure that there are summer programs for your children, and after school programs for your children. Somehow we cannot do what other countries around the world, is provide quality childcare and pre-K. We have got to change our national priorities, no more tax breaks for billionaires, and large corporations.We are going to invest in our children, and have the best public school system in the world.COOPER: Senator Sanders, before we go to Secretary Clinton  Senator Sanders, let me just follow up with you. As president, you have to decide where to spend your political capital. Theres a lot of things you want to do, where does fixing Mrs. Kims daughters school and other schools, where does that lay in your list of things to do...SANDERS: ... Anderson, not only do we have a crumbling school system in Detroit, and in many other areas, we have  and everybody in this room should be embarrassed by this, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth. That is a disgrace.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: So, when you ask me about my priorities, my priorities are that no, were not going to give tax breaks to the wealthy. Were going to ask them to start paying their fair share of taxes so we can raise the money to make sure that every child in this country, in Detroit, in Vermont, gets the quality education that he or she deserves.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Mrs. Kim (ph), here is what I would do as president. Number one, I would reinstate a program we did have during the 1990s where the federal government provided funding to repair and modernize public schools because a lot of communities cant afford to do that on their own.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Secondly, I would use every legal means at my disposal to try to force the Governor and the state to return the schools to the people of Detroit  to end the emergency management...(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)CLINTON: ... which, I believe, if you look at the data, the situation has only gotten worse with these emergency managers that have put the system further in debt.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Number three, I want to set-up inside the Department of Education, for want of a better term, kind of an education SWAT team, if you will. Where weve got qualified people, teachers, principals, maybe folks who are retired, maybe folks who are active, but all of whom are willing to come and help. When Detroit gets back their schools, they should have all the help they can get to be able to get teachers in the classroom, to be able to find spaces while schools are being repaired. And, I also would look at how we could through the federal government support more teachers because were going to have a teacher shortage in some of the hardest to teach districts...(APPLAUSE)COOPER: ... (inaudible)CLINTON: ... including Detroit.COOPER: Let me just follow up with the Secretary and then Ill come back to you.Secretary Clinton, youve been endorsed by two of the biggest teachers unions. Theres an awful lot of great teachers in this country. Its an incredibly difficult job, one of the most difficult jobs there is but union rules often make it impossible fire bad teachers and that means disadvantaged kids are sometimes taught by the least qualified. Do you think unions protect bad teachers?CLINTON: You know, I am proud to have been endorsed by the AFT and the NEA, and Ive had very good relationship with both unions, with their leadership. And weve really candid conversations because we are going to have to take a look at  what do we need in the 21st century to really involve families, to help kids who have more problems than just academic problems?A lot of what has happened and honestly it really pains me, a lot of people have blaming and scape-goating teachers because they dont want to put the money into the schools system that deserve the support that comes from the government doing its job.COOPER: So just to follow up, you dont believe unions protect bad teachers?CLINTON: You know what - I have told my friends at the top of both unions, weve got take a look at this because it is one of the most common criticisms. We need to eliminate the criticism.You know, teachers do so much good, they are often working under most difficult circumstances. So anything that could be changed, I want them to look at it. I will be a good partner to make sure that whatever I can do as president, I will do to support the teachers of our country.COOPER: Senator Sanders?SANDERS: What our campaign is about, is asking people to think big not small. And when we think big and we talk about education, weve got to ask ourselves a simple question, how is it  starting at college that hundreds of thousands of bright young people are today, unable to go to college because they cant afford it? How is it that maybe your kid  and when I was growing up, we didnt have any money  were not even dreaming about going to college because they knew it was another world.So starting with the top, now I know some people think its a radical idea, I dont. I believe that every public college and university in this country should be tuition free.(APPLAUSE)So that your child regardless of the income of your family knows that if shes studies hard, she is going to be able to go to college. And you know what else we do? We invest in child care. Right now, youve got child-care workers making McDonalds wages, that is crazy.COOPER: Thank you Senator.SANDERS: I want well trained, well paid, child care workers to give our youngest kids advance opportunities.COOPER: I want to go over to my colleague, Don Lemon.LEMON: Anderson, thank you very much.Secretary, I want to turn now from the state of our nations school to the state of our nations crumbling infrastructure, which you talked a little bit about in the beginning of this debate. But beyond the Detroit schools and Flint water crisis; pipes, roads, and bridges are in need of repair. It would take trillions of dollars to fix it all. Senator Sanders has proposed a one trillion dollar plan but yours is only a quarter of that, is your plan big enough to fix the crumbling infrastructure in this country?CLINTON: Well, theres no doubt, we have an enormous backlog of infrastructure repairs. Heres what Id do - the congress finally got around to pass the Highway Transportation Bill, which should never have been partisan - it turned into be one partisan argument. I want to go further.I want to put 250 billion dollars additional, on top of what Congress has done. That gets us to a half a billion. I want to start a National Infrastructure Bank. I want to capitalize it with 25 billion that I believe will leverage 10 times that, thats another 250 billion.So Im trying to do this in a way that will gain support and be affordable but theres no doubt, we have to do more on our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports. And as weve talked in the beginning here, under our ground, our water systems, our sewer systems. We have pipelines that are leaking and that are dangerous. We have so much work to be done and if we can put millions of peoples to work, I think my plan is a very good way to begin doing that work and get people out there doing it.LEMON: Thank you, Secretary. Senator Sanders, critics of the proposal say its yet another example of a costly plan that will never get through Congress and cant be paid for. The best deal is what the Secretary just mentioned, the deal President Obama could negotiate with Republicans, is a $305 billion dollar highway bill. If he couldnt do more, how can you?SANDERS: Well, lets begin by discussing the problem. As youve indicated, the American Society of Civil Engineers say we need trillions of dollars  trillions of dollars  just to bring up our infrastructure to deal with  water systems like Flint, just to bring them up to decent levels.We have suggested a trillion-dollar investment. Now, you know how were gonna pay for that? Ill tell you how were gonna pay for that. Right now, this country is losing $100 billion every single year because profitable corporations are stashing their profits in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda and in other tax havens...(APPLAUSE)... and in some cases, not paying five cents in federal income tax. I will eliminate that outrageous loophole, and we will raise $1 trillion. And by the way, not only do we rebuild our crumbling infrastructure  $1 trillion over five years creates 13 million decent-paying jobs.COOPER: Thank you  thank you, Senator Sanders.(APPLAUSE)The issue of climate change has been a major talking point for both of you. I wanted to bring in Sarah Bellaire, shes a student at the University of Michigan at Dearborn who says shes currently undecided.Ms. Bellaire has a question on fracking, which, for viewers, is a process of oil and gas drilling thats led to a significant increase in American energy production and jobs, but also raises serious environmental concerns.Sarah, your question is for Secretary Clinton, but youll both be able to weigh in. Sarah?QUESTION: Fracking can lead to environmental pollution including, but not limited to, the contamination of water supply. Do you support fracking?COOPER: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: You know, I dont support it when any locality or any state is against it, number one. I dont support it when the release of methane or contamination of water is present. I dont support it  number three  unless we can require that anybody who fracks has to tell us exactly what chemicals they are using.So by the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place. And I think thats the best approach, because right now, there places where fracking is going on that are not sufficiently regulated.So first, weve got to regulate everything that is currently underway, and we have to have a system in place that prevents further fracking unless conditions like the ones that I just mentioned are met.COOPER: Senator Sanders, you...SANDERS: My answer  my answer is a lot shorter. No, I do not support fracking.(APPLAUSE)And by the way  by the way, Anderson, Im glad you raised the issue of climate change, because the media doesnt talk enough about what the scientists are telling us, and that is, if we dont get our act together...(APPLAUSE)... the planet that were gonna leave our children may not be healthy and habitable. I have introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation in the history of the Senate, which, among other things, calls for a tax on carbon, massive investments...(APPLAUSE)... in energy efficiency, wind, solar and other sustainable energy.COOPER: Senator...SANDERS: This is a crisis we have got to deal with now.COOPER: Senator Sanders, though...(APPLAUSE)... to Secretary Clintons point, there are a number of Democratic governors in many states who say that fracking can be done safely, and that its helping their economies. Are they wrong?SANDERS: Yes.(APPLAUSE)You know  you know, one of the differences  look, Secretary Clinton  and Ive said this before, and I admit it  she has the support of all the governors  Democratic  all the Senators, all the Congressmen. I dont. I am not part of that establishment. I plead guilty.(APPLAUSE)I happen to be a member of the Environmental Committee. I have talked to scientists all over the world. And what they are telling me  if we dont get our act together, this planet could be 5 to 10 degrees warmer by the end of this century  cataclysmic problems for this planet.This is a national crisis. And I talk to scientists who tell me that fracking is doing terrible things to water systems all over this country. We have gotta be bold now. We gotta transform our energy system to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. Weve gotta do it yesterday.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, before we come to you...CLINTON: Yeah. Yeah.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Secretary Clintons gonna be able to respond. But, Senator Sanders, youve been very tough lately. Last week, you said this about Secretary Clinton.Quote, just as I believe you cant take on Wall Street while taking their money, I dont believe you can take on climate change effectively while taking money from those who would profit off the destruction of the planet.Are you suggesting that shes in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry? SANDERS: No, what I am suggesting is that we have a corrupt campaign finance system. And instead of standing up to that finance system...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: And instead of standing up to that finance system, Secretary Clinton has super PAC, which is raising huge amounts  well, I hate to say the word huge, every time I say huge it...(LAUGHTER)SANDERS: A lot of money from Wall Street and from the fossil fuel industry. I am doing it a different way. I have 5 million individual contributors who have gone to BernieSanders.com to make a $27 contribution. I dont take money from the fossil fuel industry.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Thank you, Senator.Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, first, let me say I think I have the most comprehensive plan to combat climate change. It sets some very big goals, a half billion more solar panels deployed by the end of my first term, if Im so fortunate to be president. And enough clean energy to power every home by the end of my second term.What I am looking at is how we make the transition from where we are today to where are today to where we must be. I worked with President Obama during the four years I was secretary of state to begin to put pressure on China and India and other countries to join with us to have a global agreement which we finally got in Paris.So I am committed to and focused on how we make that transition. Ive already said we are taking away the subsidies for oil and gas, but it is important that people understand that a president cant go ordering folks around. Our system doesnt permit that. I am going to set the goals. I will push everybody as hard as I can to achieve those goals. We will make progress on clean renewable energy and create millions of jobs through that.(APPLAUSE) COOPER: Senator Sanders, on the  on the campaign trail, Senator Sanders often refers to a fundraiser in January that was hosted by executives from a firm that has invested significantly in domestic fracking. Do you have any comment on that?CLINTON: I dont have any comment. I dont know that. I dont believe that there is any reason to be concerned about it. I admire what Senator Sanders has accomplished in his campaign. I have more than 850,000 donors, most of them give less than $100. I am very proud of that.And I just want to make one point. You know, we have our differences. And we get into vigorous debate about issues, but compare the substance of this debate with what you saw on the Republican stage last week.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Senator Sanders.SANDERS: Well, let me make a couple of responses. Let me pick up on the last point the secretary made. You know, we are, if elected president, going to invest a lot of money into mental health. And when you watch these Republican debates, you know why we need to invest in that.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: But heres the difference. Here is the difference. Its not a personal difference. We just do things differently. All right. I honestly  look, we have a corrupt campaign finance system. And what Secretary Clinton is saying and what every candidate who receives from the fossil fuel industry or the drug companies or Wall Street say, not going to impact me.The question the American people have to ask is, why are these people putting millions of dollars into candidates if its not going to make a difference?(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Thank you, Senator.SANDERS: And that is why, by the way, that is why one of my top priorities, if elected president will be to overturn this outrageous Citizens United Supreme Court (INAUDIBLE).(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Thank you very much, Senator.CLINTON: And...COOPER: Secretary Clinton, no, we have to go.CLINTON: And that is one of the many reasons we must all support President Obamas right to nominate a successor to Justice Scalia and demand that the Senate hold hearings and a vote on that successor because there are so many issues at stake. On the first day of my campaign, I said, we are going to reverse Citizens United. And if we cant get it done through the court, I will lead a constitutional amendment effort to reverse it that way.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: More questions coming up. Much more of the Democratic presidential debate here in Flint right after this.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)COOPER: Welcome back to the CNN Democratic Presidential Debate. Thanks very much for joining us.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Secretary Clinton, I want to ask you about something you talked about this morning. You said this morning, about your emails, that you expect the investigation to be wrapped up soon. The Republican front-runner, Donald Trump says, hes going to talk about your emails every single day if he is the nominee and out on the campaign trail.Democrats want to know, your supporters want to know, if youre the nominee, how are you going to take him on?CLINTON: Well, let me start by saying that the last time I checked as of last night, Donald Trump had received 3.6 million votes, which is a good number. And there is only one candidate in either party who has more votes than him and thats me.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: And, I am building a broad, diverse coalition across our country. Im very excited by the support were receiving. I have said, and Ill repeat here, I think that Donald Trumps bigotry, his bullying, his bluster, are not going to wear (oh) well on the American people.(APPLAUSE)So, I will look forward to engaging him because, you know, I dont think we need to make America great again. America didnt stop being great, we have to make it whole again. We have to knock down the barriers, we have to end the divisiveness, we have to unify the country.And, if Im fortunate enough to be the nominee thats exactly what I will do.COOPER: Senator Sanders, I want to ask you basically the same question. Hes called you a communist, how are you going to...SANDERS: ... That was one of the nice things that he said about me.(LAUGHTER)SANDERS: Ill tell you something, this is my right arm. Im prepared to give  no, I shouldnt say that. I would love to run against Donald Trump, and Ill tell you why.For a start, but almost  not all, but almost every poll has shown that Sanders versus Trump does a lot better than Clinton versus Trump.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Right here in Michigan there was a poll done, I think yesterday, or today, had me beating Trump in Michigan by 22 points.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Secretary Clinton beat him as well, but not by so much. And, thats true nationally, and in many other states. And, the other reason I think we can beat Trump is that our campaign is generating an enormous amount of excitement. Just in the last two days we have won the caucuses in Maine, we won that tonight with a very large turnout.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)SANDERS: We won Nebraska, we won Kansas, and Kansas was the biggest turnout in their caucus history.I think we are exciting working class people, young people who are prepared to stand up and demand that we have a government that represents all of us.COOPER: Thank you.SANDERS: And not just the few.COOPER: Thank you. I want to  we have a question from Denise Ghattas, she grew up here in Flint, Michigan. She says shes undecided on a candidate, shes got a question for  actually shes got two questions. The first one if for Senator Sanders, then shell ask another question to Secretary Clinton. Denise?QUESTION: Thank you. Senator Sanders, do you believe that God is relevant, why or why not?SANDERS: Well, I think  well, the answer is yes, and I think when we talk about God whether it is Christianity, or Judaism, or Islam, or Buddhism, what we are talking about is what all religions hold dear. And, that is to do unto others as you would like them to do unto you.(APPLAUSE)I am here tonight, and Im running for president. Im a United States Senator from my great state of Vermont because I believe that, because I believe morally and ethically we do not have a right to turn our backs on children in Flint, Michigan who are being poisoned, or veterans who are sleeping out on the street.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: What I believe as the father of seven beautiful grandchildren, I want you to worry about my grandchildren, and I promise you I will worry about your family. We are in this together.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Senator Sanders, let me just follow up. Just this weekend there was an article I read in the Detroit News saying that you keep your Judaism in the background, and thats disappointing some Jewish leaders. Is that intentional?SANDERS: No. I am very proud to be Jewish, and being Jewish is so much of what I am.Look, my fathers family was wiped out by Hitler in the Holocaust. I know about what crazy and radical, and extremist politics mean. I learned that lesson as a tiny, tiny child when my mother would take me shopping, and we would see people working in stores who had numbers on their arms because they were in Hitlers concentration camp.I am very proud of being Jewish, and that is an essential part of who I am as a human being.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Denise has a question for Secretary Clinton. DeniseQUESTION: Yes. Secretary Clinton, during our church services, we pray for the president of the United States, we pray for the armed forces, we pray for all civil authorities, three times during our liturgy. And we give thanks to them. We pray for our loved ones. We pray for our enemies. To whom and for whom do you pray?CLINTON: Well, I have been several times in your services and have joined in those prayers and have also been privileged to lead them in some settings. I pray very specifically for people whom I know by name. People who either have gone through or are experiencing difficult times, illness, divorce, death, disappointment, all of the life experiences that confront most of us.I pray for the will of God to be known that we can know it and to the best of our limited ability, try to follow it and fulfill it. I have said many times that, you know, I am a praying person, and if I havent been during the time I was in the White House, I would have become one. Because its very hard to imagine living under that kind of pressure without being able to fall back on prayer and on my faith.So I do pray for people in authority. I try to think about what they are going through, even when I disagree with them. Trying to find some common ground, some common understanding that perhaps can make me more empathetic. I dont always succeed. I will tell you that.So I pray on a pretty regular basis during the day, because I need that strength and I need that support. And especially when you are in the position that Im in and that Senator Sanders is in, where you are asking people to vote for you, to give you the most important job, not only in our country, but I would argue in the world.I think humility is one of the most important attributes that you bring to both that seeking and then if youre fortunate enough, to that holding of office and thats what I will try to do.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Thank you, secretary. Its time for closing statements. Youll each have one minute for a closing statement. Senator Sanders, we begin with you. SANDERS: My father came to this country at the age of 17 without any money. Never made any money. We lived in a three and half room rent-controlled apartment. So I learned about economics, not just in college, but in living in a family that didnt have money that had to scrape by. We are here tonight in Flint, Michigan, because a horrendous tragedy is taking place.But its not just in Flint, Michigan. We are have 29 million people who have no health insurance. Were the only major country on earth that doesnt provide paid family and medical leave. We have school systems around America that are collapsing. And yet we are the wealthiest country in the history of the world. But most people dont know that because almost all of the new incoming wealth is going to the top one percent.I believe, and with all due respect to my good friend, Secretary Clinton, that it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics. It is too late for a corrupt campaign finance system and super-PACs that raise enormous amounts of money from special interests.We need in this country a political revolution where ordinary people stand up and reclaim the government that men and women fought and died for. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Thank you, senator.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, Im running for president to do my very best to knock down every barrier that stands in the way of America realizing its potential and every American having a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. We have a lot of work to do. We have economic barriers. Thats why Ive laid out plans for more good jobs with rising incomes. We have barriers that stand in the way of quality health care. Thats why I will build on the Affordable Care Act.We have barriers to education. Thats why I want to start early and provide debt-free tuition, and deal with student debt so it is no longer the burden that weighs down so many young Americans. And I do want to take on the barriers of systemic racism. I may not have experienced them, but I see the results every single day.So Im asking for your support in the primary here in Michigan on Tuesday. Im asking for it, and I will do whatever I can as the Democratic nominee to run a campaign youll be proud of.I dont intend to get into the gutter with whoever they nominate, but instead to lift our sights, to set big goals, to make it clear that Americas best days can be and are ahead of us.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: I want to thank both the candidates. While weve been debating tonight, CNN has learned that a labor union fund has committed $25 million in low-interest loans to help replace lead- contaminated pipes.I want to thank the candidates, the Democratic National Committee...(APPLAUSE)... our hosts here at the Flint Cultural Center, and most of all, the people of Flint. Just two days from now, its another Super Tuesday, when Michigan and three other states have primaries. Well have all-day coverage.On Wednesday well simulcast the next Democratic presidential debate. Well air on CNN in English, and then on Univision in Spanish. And on Thursday, CNN hosts a Republican presidential debate in Miami  the last one before the critical Florida and Ohio primaries.Well have full analysis of tonights debate in one hour. Right now, please stay tuned for the premiere of a brand-new CNN original series about great American presidential races. Here is The Race for the White House.'

aS'Heres how we analyzed the Democratic debate.Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont faced off yet again Sunday night, after a weekend of voting where both Democrats notched wins. Mr. Sanders won the Maine Democratic caucuses, according to The Associated Press. The debate, hosted by CNN, took place in Flint, Mich., a town facing a drinking water crisis, in a state where voters head to the polls on Tuesday that will prove a crucial test for both candidates. Anderson Cooper, the debate moderator, kicked off the night by explaining why CNN had chosen to stage its latest debate in Flint, Mich. The city is in crisis, he said, and the water is toxic. Both Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton also paid homage to Flint in their minute-long opening statements, calling for the states governor, Rick Snyder, to resign. Mr. Sanders called the situation in Flint a dereliction of duty, and Mrs. Clinton said she planned to continue to shine a very bright spotlight on what has happened in this city. Mrs. Clinton declined to say if the head of the Environmental Protection Agency should be fired, saying she didnt know how high up the chain the problem went. But both she and Mr. Sanders said whoever was responsible for the crisis should absolutely be relieved of their job. The water crisis in Flint dominated the first 20 minutes of the debate, with every question (and follow-up) focusing on some aspect of the tragedy. The first question not about the water maintained focus on the community, with a voter asking what Mrs. Clinton would do to keep jobs from being sent overseas. The first heated moment came after Mrs. Clinton talked about her efforts to stop jobs from going overseas. I am very glad that secretary Clinton has discovered religion on this issue, but its a little bit too late, Mr. Sanders said, arguing that his rival had supported many disastrous trade agreements. Mrs. Clinton countered by pointing out that Mr. Sanders had opposed the auto bailout  a key issue for Michigan, with its reliance on the auto industry, and one that she had supported. The two candidates also tussled over the speeches Mrs. Clinton gave to banking groups. Mr. Sanders said if you get paid a couple hundred thousand dollars for a speech, it must be a great speech  I think we should release it. Mrs. Clinton said she would be happy to release transcripts of her speeches, assuming her potential opponents did the same. Ill release it! Here it is! Mr. Sanders said, throwing up his hands and prompting chuckles. There aint nothing! I dont give speeches to Wall Street! Mrs. Clinton used an emotional question on gun violence  from a father whose daughter was recently injured in a shooting spree  to highlight a key difference between herself and Mr. Sanders: Her vote against giving immunity to gun manufacturers. Mr. Sanders argued that he has a D-minus rating from the N.R.A., but still stands by his position, saying that what Mrs. Clinton is suggesting is ending gun manufacturing in America. I dont agree with that.As the exchange grew increasingly heated, Mrs. Clinton ended by evoking the children who were killed in the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, to applause. Youre not the only person whose heart was broken, Mr. Sanders said. Mr. Sanders, who has struggled with minority voters, was asked to talk about personal experiences that have helped him understand the mind-set and values of other cultures. The Vermont senator discussed how, as a student at the University of Chicago, he had worked with his fellow students, black and white, to desegregate housing owned by the university. Most candidates running for president usually dont put this on their rsum, but a year later I was arrested by Chicago police for trying to desegregate the Chicago school system, he added.Mrs. Clinton, for her part, talked about a meaningful experience shed had as a young woman working for Marian Wright Edelman, investigating whether schools in Alabama were discriminating based on race. Asked a follow-up question on racial blind spots, Mrs. Clinton said that as a white woman in America, there were some experiences she simply hasnt had  like having The Talk with your children, about a routine stop by the police that could end in violence. Mr. Sanders recalled visiting the nations capital with an African-American colleague, only to learn the man refused to hail cabs in Washington, D.C., for fear that as a black man he might be ignored. When youre white, you dont know what its like to be living in a ghetto, he said, later. On the issue of fracking, Mrs. Clinton said she supported the process only if it were highly regulated. Laying out several conditions, she explained that, by the time you get through all of my conditions, she doubted there would be much fracking occurring in America. Mr. Sanders offered a slightly more succinct answer: My answer is a lot shorter, he said. No. I do not support fracking. Because no debate is complete without the looming presence of Donald J. Trump, one of the final questions was how Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders would take on the real estate billionaire. The last time I checked, as of last night, Donald Trump had received 3.6 million votes, which is a good number, Mrs. Clinton said. Theres only one candidate in either party who has more votes than him  and thats me.Donald Trumps bigotry, his bullying, and his bluster are not going to wear well on the America people, she added. Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, offered, Sanders versus Trump does a lot better than Clinton versus Trump.'

aS'Heres how we analyzed the Republican debate, and fact checked it._______As members of the Republican Partys establishment denounced Donald J. Trump after his string of Super Tuesday victories, the four remaining candidates gathered in Detroit on Thursday for yet another face-off. These were the highlights: And the first question, unsurprisingly, went to Mr. Trump, asking him to respond to Mitt Romneys scathing attack against him on Thursday. The billionaire was quick to dismiss Mr. Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, as a failed candidate who is desperate to be relevant. Mr. Trump also got the second question, about the other major news of the week  his refusal to instantaneously reject the support of David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan. This time, Mr. Trump was ready: I totally disavow the Ku Klux Klan, he said. I totally disavow David Duke. Things got personal  and slightly crude  quickly, when Senator Marco Rubio of Florida was asked about his recent strategy of transforming himself into Trump Lite, hitting the reality TV star with frat-boy-style personal insults. Mr. Rubio said that if anyone deserved such treatment, it was the insult king himself, Mr. Trump, but that he would prefer to talk about substantive policy.Suffice it to say, he did not get his wish. Given the chance to respond, Mr. Trump singled out a winking insult of Mr. Rubios  that Mr. Trump has small hands, an implication that other parts of his, er, anatomy may be similarly small. I guarantee you, theres no problem, Mr. Trump clarified. Hardly fighting words, or even a bold declaration, but in his first exchange of the debate, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio promised that he would finish first in his home state: I will win Ohio, he said. (Senator Ted Cruz of Texas won his home state on Tuesday, and Mr. Rubio needs to win Florida to stay politically viable.) The fifth candidate onstage? Fox News itself, which did a real-time fact check  complete with ready-to-go infographics  of Mr. Trumps numbers, saying the cost savings hes laid out to reduce the total deficit dont add up. The figures spoke for themselves, and Mr. Trump never directly addressed the inconsistencies with his math. (That said, Mr. Trump is hardly the first candidate whose lofty plan isnt entirely rooted in reality.) Mr. Trump is starting to sound like a general election candidate. Asked about reports that he had told the editorial board of The New York Times, in an off-the-record interview, that he might be more flexible on immigration than his public stance, Mr. Trump replied, There always has to be some tug and pull and deal. He was quick to add that hes still the strongest on fighting illegal immigration, and plans to build a wall at the nations Southern border  but implied that he might, for instance, be open to negotiating on the exact height of the wall. We need give and take in government, Mr. Trump said. And again on immigration, Mr. Trump showed signs of pivoting toward the general election. Im changing, Im changing, he said, explaining that he was softening his position on high-skilled workers, who he said are valuable to the nations economy and should be allowed to stay in the country. Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio teamed up against Mr. Trump over the fact that he used foreign workers, rather than Americans, at Mar-a-Lago, his Palm Beach, Fla., club.You argue that youre here to fight for the American worker, but when you have a chance to fight for the American worker, youre hiring workers from overseas and youre making your clothes overseas, Mr. Rubio said. The exchange ended with Mr. Cruz accusing Mr. Trump of lying, and Mr. Trump returning fire, calling the Texas senator Lying Ted. Lets just say that Mr. Kasich, who has cast himself as a happy warrior, doesnt have a very high opinion of his remaining rivals. I knew Ronald Reagan, Mr. Kasich said, reprising a famous debate line with a twist of his own. And Ill leave it right there. You can figure that out. Mr. Rubio used Trump University, which is currently embroiled in a class-action lawsuit, to attack Mr. Trump, saying the students paid $1,500 and never received what they were promised. Hes trying to con people into giving him their vote, just like he conned these people into giving him their money, Mr. Rubio said.The Florida senator received an assist from Megyn Kelly, one of the moderators, who was quick with her own facts criticizing Trump University, including the fact that the Better Business Bureau had most recently graded it a D-minus. But, undaunted, Mr. Trump turned the attack back on Mr. Rubio, saying he was the true con artist. He doesnt go to vote, Mr. Trump said. Hes absent. During a heated exchange with Mr. Trump  Count to 10, Donald, count to 10, Mr. Cruz said, treating him like a child mid-tantrum  Mr. Cruz also used the debate stage to make a broad pitch to Republican voters, urging them to coalesce around his candidacy. Come join us, we welcome you to our team, Mr. Cruz said, noting that he has finished ahead of Mr. Trump in five nominating contests so far, the only candidate to have done so that many times. If you dont want him to be the nominee, I ask you to stand with us as a broad coalition of people who believe in the Constitution, who believe in freedom. A back-and-forth over Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., whom many Republicans blame for upholding portions of President Obamas health care law, quickly devolved into an amusing insult-off between Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump. Donald has a tenuous relationship with the truth, Mr. Cruz said. Breathe, breathe, breathe.Lying Ted, Mr. Trump countered.Mr. Rubio then injected a bit a humor, pointing at his rivals and asking if he could answer the question when theyre done doing yoga. Well, hes very flexible, Mr. Rubio added, referring to Mr. Trumps previous claim that he was more flexible on the topic of immigration than previously stated, so you never know. As the debate wound down, Fox News asked Mr. Trumps rivals if they would support him, should he become the nominee. All three men gave an unequivocal yes  though Mr. Kasich also gave himself a playful plug. I kind of think before its all said and done, Ill be the nominee, the Ohio governor said. Im the little engine that can.Asked a version of the same question  if hell support the Republican nominee if its not him  Mr. Trump was first incredulous: Even if its not me?! he asked. But then he, too, said yes, committing to support the Republican nominee, whomever that may be.'

aS'DemocratsWhen Hillary Clinton visited here last week, Mayor Kasim Reed gripped a microphone at City Hall and offered some words of reassurance: Dont worry about Georgia.Mr. Reeds assessment was prescient, and Mrs. Clinton picked up a commanding victory in a state whose 102 delegates made it one of Super Tuesdays most valuable.The outcome in Georgia, especially in predominantly black areas, was a disappointment for Senator Bernie Sanders, who appeared at Morehouse College, which is historically black, last month.Mrs. Clintons widely expected victory was a reversal of her electoral fortunes in Georgia in 2008, when she lost to Barack Obama by 35 percentage points statewide and faltered in most counties in metropolitan Atlanta.But on Tuesday, news organizations projected Mrs. Clintons victory as soon as the polls closed. She was expected to win by significant margins in the states most populous counties, some of which are traditional Democratic strongholds in general elections.It was all too much for Mr. Sanders, who struggled to win the support of many African-American voters here. Exit polling indicated that at least eight in 10 black voters cast their ballots for Mrs. ClintonRepublicansIn the days before the Republican primary in Georgia, where 76 delegates were at stake, Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio seemed to know that they could only square off for second place. On Tuesday night, Donald J. Trump showed why.Mr. Trumps victory was projected by The Associated Press soon after voting ended on Tuesday, one day after he appeared at an enormous rally in Valdosta, near the Florida border. The outcome of the scramble to be the runner-up was far less clear.Although exit polls showed that Mr. Trump performed well among evangelical voters, a vast voting bloc in Republican politics in Georgia, he also captured the support of half of voters who said that a candidates religion did not matter.Mr. Trump may have benefited from decisions by some of the states leading Republicans not to endorse a candidate, but his support appeared widespread and, according to some polling, might have grown in the final days.Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio made late efforts in Georgia to cut into Mr. Trumps support, and each others. Mr. Cruz made a pair of stops here on Saturday, while Mr. Rubio returned twice in three days.Mr. Rubios schedule showed a clearer play for voters in vote-rich metro Atlanta, but Mr. Cruz seemed to seek a broader blend of suburban and rural support. ALAN BLINDER DemocratsHillary Clinton narrowly won in Massachusetts, wresting from Senator Bernie Sanders one of the few Super Tuesday states he had seriously contested.Massachusetts was perceived as a must-win for Mr. Sanders: If he could not win a progressive Northeast state that had half a million college students and bordered his home state of Vermont, his viability elsewhere would be seriously questioned. And so he poured in resources here, visited twice in the last week and matched the Clinton ground game.But Mrs. Clinton had a lot going for her in Massachusetts, which has 116 delegates. She won the state in 2008 against Barack Obama by 16 percentage points. She had widespread institutional backing from Democratic officials, including the mayor of Boston, Martin J. Walsh. She raised more than $4 million from residents, almost three times as much as Mr. Sanders. And she significantly increased her television spending in the last week, though he still outspent her by more than two to one.Mr. Sanders did win over voters under 30 by nearly two to one, according to exit polls by Edison Research. But Mrs. Clinton did better among older voters, and led by double digits among those 30 to 44. Among voters with family incomes below $100,000, Mr. Sanders topped Mrs. Clinton by about 10 percentage points; among those with family incomes above that threshold, Mrs. Clinton won by about 20 points.RepublicansDonald J. Trump vanquished his opponents in the Massachusetts Republican primary on Tuesday, his projected victory declared moments after the polls closed.Nearly 20,000 Massachusetts voters dropped out of the Democratic Party in recent weeks and changed their affiliation to Republican  most likely to vote for Mr. Trump, according to Secretary of State William Galvin, a Democrat. Unenrolled voters can vote in either primary.Mr. Galvin said in an interview that he had seen such shifts in previous primaries, including in 2000, when Democrats switched parties to vote for Senator John McCain. But, he said, the movement this year was the most he has seen in such a short time frame. Its clearly all Trump-related, he said.The state has plenty of angry white, working-class voters who were drawn to Mr. Trump, much as they were drawn to Scott Brown in his successful Senate race in 2010.Another factor believed to be in Mr. Trumps favor here was that he was the least overtly religious of the candidates; like the rest of New England, Massachusetts is among the least religious states.Mr. Trump dominated nearly every demographic group, losing only among voters with postgraduate degrees, who supported Senator Marco Rubio, according to exit polls by Edison Research.Mr. Trumps several visits to the state and outspoken admiration for the Patriots quarterback Tom Brady probably did not hurt, nor did Mr. Bradys reciprocal support. KATHARINE Q. SEELYEDemocratsHillary Clintons commanding victory in Texas on Tuesday showed that her appeal to minority voters extends to Hispanics as well as African-Americans, whose support had propelled her landslide win three days earlier in South Carolina.Mrs. Clinton defeated Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose strength with Hispanic voters in the Nevada caucuses had worried the Clinton campaign.Mrs. Clintons share of Texas 252 delegates, more than twice the number at stake in any other Democratic race on Tuesday, should widen a gap that is increasingly difficult mathematically for Mr. Sanders to bridge.The victory was expected after Mrs. Clinton had led in Texas polls by double digits before Tuesday. Mr. Sanders rarely campaigned in the state in recent days, instead focusing on states outside the South where Democratic turnout is not as heavily Hispanic and African-American.About three in 10 voters were Hispanic, according to exit polls by Edison Research, and about two-thirds of them supported Mrs. Clinton. Hispanics accounted for about one in three registered Democrats in Texas in 2012, and they participated in the 2014 midterm elections at a higher rate than blacks, according to exit polls.Eight in 10 black voters supported her, according to the exit polls taken Tuesday.RepublicansSenator Ted Cruz carried his home state of Texas on Tuesday, a must-win for his campaign that may strengthen his assertion that he alone is the viable alternative in a head-to-head contest with Donald J. Trump after an earlier victory in the Iowa caucuses.Two in three Texas Republicans said in exit polls by Edison Research that they would be satisfied with Mr. Cruz as the nominee, compared with fewer than half who would be satisfied with Mr. Trump.Hispanics represented about 10 percent of voters,and almost a third of them supported Mr. Cruz. No candidate won a higher share of their votes. Voters were split over whether illegal immigrants should have a path to legal status or should be deported.From the day Mr. Cruz entered the race, he was focused on the seven Southern states voting on Tuesday, but he has watched Mr. Trump snatch away white evangelical Christians and Tea Party voters who he hoped would form a Cruz coalition.Mr. Cruz, who won his Senate seat in 2012 as an uncompromising outsider, ended up retreating to Texas  where 155 delegates were at stake, the most of any state voting on Tuesday  as if it were his own personal Alamo. On Monday, he held rallies in Dallas, San Antonio and Houston, assuring supporters, Were going to have a very good Super Tuesday.And despite leading a government shutdown in 2013, Mr. Cruz lost the anti-establishment mantle to Mr. Trump. TRIP GABRIELDemocratsEight years ago, Hillary Clinton lost the Democratic primary in Virginia by a wide margin to Barack Obama. On Tuesday night, it was a far different story, with the race being called in her favor over Senator Bernie Sanders almost as soon as the polls closed.Mrs. Clintons win appeared attributable, in large part, to Democratic voters in favor of the status quo. Six in 10 voters said the next president should generally continue President Obamas policies, and these voters overwhelmingly supported Mrs. Clinton, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research.Another important demographic in Mrs. Clintons win appeared to be blacks, who accounted for about a quarter of Democratic primary voters in the state, according to exit polls. More than eight in 10 of them supported Mrs. Clinton, who also won a majority of white voters.The top issue to Democratic primary voters in Virginia was the economy, and the candidate quality most important to voters was experience. Mrs. Clinton won the support of two-thirds of voters who cited the economy, and more than nine in 10 voters who prioritized experience.Even as she led in polls, Mrs. Clinton campaigned Monday in Virginia, where 110 delegates were at stake.RepublicansDonald J. Trump won Virginia, staving off an effort by Senator Marco Rubio to make it a closer race than some polls predicted.Voters who supported Mr. Trump appeared to strike a sharp contrast with those who backed Mr. Rubio, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research.Mr. Trump won among men, lower-income and less-educated voters, conservatives, veterans, evangelicals and those who preferred a government outsider. Mr. Rubio seemed to take a larger share of women, while winning among well-educated and higher-income voters, and those who favored political experience.Mr. Trump led with 35 percent of the vote, with 93 percent of precincts reporting. Mr. Rubio was second, with 32 percent, having pulled in a larger share of votes in suburban areas near Washington like Fairfax County.What appeared to make it a narrower race was Mr. Rubios broad appeal. A majority of voters said they would be satisfied with Mr. Rubio as the nominee, while only about four in 10 said they would be satisfied with either Mr. Trump or Senator Ted Cruz. About three in 10 voters leaving Republican primary sites identified as independents, exit polls showed.Back in November, Mr. Trump was the first of the Republican candidates to submit signatures for the primary in Virginia, where there were 49 delegates at stake, awarded proportionately.

aS'Heres how we analyzed the Republican debate, and fact checked.HOUSTON  With less than a week to go before 12 states cast their ballots on Super Tuesday, the remaining Republican presidential candidates gathered here for their final debate before the vote. These were the highlights: The first question of the debate focused on immigration, as Donald J. Trump and Senator Marco Rubio disagreed over each others record on immigration. Mr. Rubio accused Mr. Trump of shifting his position on immigration, and for hiring illegal immigrants at his hotels. Mr. Trump defended his past, saying it was the only help he could get, and shot back at Mr. Rubio: Im the only one on the stage who has hired anyone. The criticism of Mr. Trump would continue for most of the night, with Mr. Rubio accusing him again of using illegal immigration to build his properties and that his name brand ties are made in China. Mr. Trump shot back that it made for a such a cute sound bite, but Mr. Rubio was undeterred. Make them in America, he said repeatedly to Mr. Trump. As Senator Ted Cruz and Mr. Trump argued over deportation, Gov. John Kasich offered a more moderate stance on immigration, proclaiming I dont think were going to tear families apart. He favored a guest worker program, and a path to legal status, not citizenship. Ben Carson also backed a guest worker program, but they do not become American citizens, they do not vote. Mr. Trump promised that religious liberty would be a litmus test for nominating a Supreme Court justice, while Mr. Cruz promised to nominate a strict constitutionalist. But the debate over the court quickly turned into a battle between the two, as Mr. Trump pointed to Mr. Cruzs support of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. as a worrisome point in his record, saying Justice Roberts gave the country Obamacare, or might as well be called Robertscare.  Mr. Trump, asked about Mitt Romneys insinuations regarding his unreleased tax returns, attributed the delay in releasing them is because he is being audited right now for two or three years. He added: you dont learn anything about anyones wealth from a tax return. Mr. Kasich said that he thought religious liberty should not interfere with business. If youre in the business of commerce, conduct commerce, he said, adding that If you dont agree with their lifestyle, say a prayer for them later. As Mr. Rubio challenged Mr. Trumps position on the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Trump said he would keep pre-existing conditions and remove the lines around the states to allow insurance companies to compete nationally, an idea he repeated verbatim when challenged. Now hes repeating himself, Mr. Rubio said with a smile. Mr. Cruz accused Mr. Trump of supporting socialized medicine, something Mr. Trump flatly denied. But he also added he would not let people go untreated. Call it what you want, people are not going to be dying on the street, Mr. Trump said. Debating the crisis in the Middle East, Mr. Trump reiterated his pro-Israel position, but added that it doesnt do any good to start demeaning the neighbors, as he hoped to make peace there a key goal of his administration. Mr. Rubio said that was an anti-Israel position, and Mr. Cruz retorted saying he would stand unapologetically with the nation of Israel. Mr. Kasich said he would love to see regime change in North Korea, but stopped short of saying he would risk military intervention, noting it would depend on what the situation was. The Chinese, in Mr. Kasichs view, were best positioned to force regime change in North Korea. As Mr. Trump, Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz continued to argue over Israel, flinging insults like liar and choke artist, Mr. Carson, who has received the least amount of speaking time, grew frustrated. Could somebody attack me please? A rare moment of agreement in a very contentious debate: Mr. Cruz, Mr. Rubio and Mr. Carson all said that Apple should comply with a court order to allow the F.B.I. to investigate the iPhone from one of the San Bernardino shooters.'

aS'From Lee Atwaters whispers that a congressional candidate was psychotic to rumors that John McCain had fathered a black child out of wedlock to fake Mormon holiday cards supposedly sent by Mitt Romney, South Carolina is infamous for its dirty politics.While this year has not lived up to past levels of salaciousness  so far  presidential candidates are not shying away from employing underhanded tricks ahead of the Republican South Carolina primary on Saturday. And they have been more than happy to cry foul.Here are some of the more creative efforts:Senator Marco Rubio spends much of his time on the campaign trail discussing how President Obama is trying to destroy America. To rebut that notion, Senator Ted Cruzs campaign set up The Real Rubio Record website highlighting Mr. Rubios cooperation with Democrats over the years. Taking some license with imagery, the Cruz campaign blended photographs to create an image of a beaming (and short) Mr. Rubio shaking hands with Mr. Obama.The Cruz campaign was also put on the defensive by a false Facebook post that depicted Representative Trey Gowdy, a prominent supporter of Senator Marco Rubio, changing his mind and formally backing Mr. Cruz. Mr. Cruz said his team had absolutely nothing to do with this fraudulent Facebook post.Mr. Cruz has also been on the receiving end of some mudslinging. Donald J. Trump happily posted a quotation on Twitter purportedly from former Senator Tom Coburn calling Mr. Cruz one of the most dishonest people in D.C. The only problem was that Mr. Coburn never said that. Mr. Trump and his social media director deleted the tweets, but the candidate still managed to mention the quotation on the campaign trail.Mr. Trump, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio have all accused one another of using push polls, a tactic in which a fake pollster calls up voters and asks loaded questions that spread misinformation. Faced with its own allegations of dishonesty, the Cruz campaign employed former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas this week to accuse Mr. Rubio of spreading rumors. The Rubio campaign has hypocritically and falsely accused the Cruz campaign of negative push polling, while at the same time hitting South Carolinians all across the state with their own negative and inaccurate push polls against Cruz, Mr. Perry said.South Carolina is not known for having a large Spanish-speaking population, but voters are getting automated calls in Spanish that detail Mr. Rubios support for so-called amnesty for undocumented immigrants. The Huffington Post unearthed the recordings, which are intended to make Republican voters think that Mr. Rubio is promising not to deport immigrants. The Rubio campaign said that Mr. Cruzs team has now gone bilingual with their false dirty tricks. The Cruz campaign denied any responsibility for the calls.'

aS'Following is a transcript of the Republican debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.DICKERSON: Good evening. Im John Dickerson. This holiday weekend, as America honors our first president, were about to hear from six men who hope to be the 45th. The candidates for the Republican nomination are here in South Carolina for their ninth debate, one week before this state holds the first-in-the-South primary.George Washington wrote that the truth will ultimately prevail where there is pains taken to bring it to light. We hope to shed some light on the candidates positions tonight to help voters make up their minds.So gentlemen, please join us on stage.(APPLAUSE)With us tonight  with us tonight are retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson of Florida, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.(APPLAUSE)Businessman Donald Trump of New York.(APPLAUSE)Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.(APPLAUSE)Former Governor Jeb Bush of Florida.(APPLAUSE)And Governor John Kasich of Ohio.(APPLAUSE)Now, as most of you have heard by now, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died today at the age of 79. He was the longest-serving member of the court, appointed by President Reagan in 1986. Justice Scalia was the courts leading conservative, and even those who disagreed with his opinions regarded him as a brilliant legal scholar. Please join us and the candidates on our stage in a moment of silence for Justice Antonin Scalia. Thank you.We will talk to the candidates about Justice Scalia and the road ahead when the debate begins in a moment.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)DICKERSON: Before we get started, candidates, here are the rules. When we ask you a question, you will have one minute to answer, and 30 seconds more if we ask a follow-up. If youre attacked by another candidate, you get 30 seconds to respond.And heres how we keep time. After we ask a question, youll get a green light. The yellow light means you have 30 seconds left to finish your answer, and when time is up, the light turns red. That means please stop talking. If you keep talking, youll hear this.(BELL RINGING)You dont want to hear that. Joining me in the questioning tonight, my CBS News colleague, chief White House correspondent Major Garrett, and Kimberley Strassel, who is on the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal.And you can participate in the debate through our partnership with Twitter. Tweet us your questions and comments using the hashtag #GOPDebate.So, lets begin.First, the death of Justice Scalia, and the vacancy that leaves on the Supreme Court. Mr. Trump, I want to start with you. Youve said that the president shouldnt nominate anyone in the rest of his term to replace Justice Scalia. If you were president and had a chance, with 11 months left to go in your term, wouldnt it be an abdication, to conservatives in particular, not to name a conservative justice with the rest of your term?TRUMP: Well, I can say this. If the president, and if I were president now, I would certainly want to try and nominate a justice. Im sure that, frankly, Im absolutely sure that President Obama will try and do it. I hope that our Senate is going to be able  Mitch, and the entire group, is going to be able to do something about it.In times of delay, we could have a Diane Sykes, or you could have a Bill Pryor  we have some fantastic people. But this is a tremendous blow to conservatism. Its a tremendous blow, frankly, to our country.DICKERSON: So, just to be clear on this, Mr. Trump, youre O.K. with the president nominating somebody ...TRUMP: ... I think hes going to do it whether or Im O.K. with it or not. I think its up to Mitch McConnell and everybody else to stop it. Its called delay, delay, delay.(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Governor Kasich, I want to get your thoughts on this. Justice Scalia was a real believer, obviously, in the strict word of the Constitution. Now, Harry Reid says that a failure to fill his vacancy would be, quote, shameful abdication of one of the Senates most essential constitutional responsibilities.Where do you come down on this?KASICH: Well, John, first of all, if I were president, we wouldnt have the divisions in the country we have today. I do want to take a second as we reflected on Judge Scalia, its amazing  its not even two minutes after the death of Judge Scalia, nine children here today, their father didnt wake up. His wife, sad, but I just wish we hadnt run so fast into politics.Heres my concern about this. The country is so divided right now, and now were going to see another partisan fight take place. I really wish the president would think about not nominating somebody. If you were to nominate somebody, lets have him pick somebody thats going to have unanimous approval, and such widespread approval across the country that this could happen without a lot of recrimination. I dont think thats going to happen, and I would like the president just to, for once here, put the country first. Were going to have an election for president very soon, and the people will understand what is at stake in that election.And so I believe the president should not move forward, and I think that we ought to let the next president of the United States decide who is going to run that Supreme Court with a vote by the people of the United...(BELL RINGING)KASICH: ... States of America.(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Dr. Carson. Dr. Carson, you, like others, put out a statement after the death was announced, and you said the president should delay.Youve written a book on the Constitution recently. What does the Constitution say about whose duty it is here to act in this kind of a situation?CARSON: Well, the current Constitution actually doesnt address that particular situation, but the fact of the matter is the Supreme Court, obviously, is a very important part of our governmental system. And when our Constitution was put in place, the average age of death was under 50, and therefore the whole concept of lifetime appointments for Supreme Court judges and federal judges was not considered to be a big deal.Obviously, that has changed, and its something that probably needs to be looked at pretty carefully at some point. But, we need to start thinking about the divisiveness that is going on in our country. I looked at some of the remarks that people made after finding out that Justice Scalia had died, and they were truly nasty remarks. And that we have managed to get to that position in our country is truly a shame. And we should be thinking about how we could create some healing in this land.But, right now, were not going to get healing with President Obama. Thats very United Nations clear. So, I...(BELL RINGING)CARSON: ... fully agree that we should not allow a judge to be appointed during his time.DICKERSON: Senator Rubio, youre a...(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Senator Rubio, youre a lawyer. Quickly, can you address the issue of whether the Constitution tells us who has the power to appoint Supreme Court justices?And then, also, the Senate Republicans last year floated an idea of removing the filibuster for Senate  excuse me, for Supreme Court nominations. You seemed open to that. Whats your feeling on that now?RUBIO: Well, let me first talk about Justice Scalia. His loss is tremendous, and obviously our hearts and prayers go out to his family. He will go down as one of the great justices in the history of this republic.You talk about someone who defended consistently the original meaning of the Constitution, who understood that the Constitution was not there to be interpreted based on the fads of the moment, but it was there to be interpreted according to its original meaning.Justice Scalia understood that better than anyone in the history of this republic. His dissent, for example, on the independent counsel case is a brilliant piece of jurist work. And, of course, his dissent on Obergefell as well.No. 2, I do not believe the president should appoint someone. And its not unprecedented. In fact, it has been over 80 years since a lame duck president has appointed a Supreme Court justice.And it remind us of this, how important this election is. Someone on this stage will get to choose the balance of the Supreme Court, and it will begin by filling this vacancy thats there now.And we need to put people on the bench that understand that the Constitution is not a living and breathing document. It is to be interpreted as originally meant.DICKERSON: Quickly, though, on this question...(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Very quickly, Senator, on this specific question, though. You were once in favor of dropping the threshold...(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: Thats not accurate.DICKERSON: ... majority  you were never in favor of that?RUBIO: No, Ive never  there has been, for example, today, according to the changes Harry Reid made, appellate judges can now be appointed by a simple majority, but not Supreme Court justices.And I think today you see the wisdom of why we dont want that to change. Because if that were the case and we were not in charge of the Senate, Harry Reid and Barack Obama would ram down our throat a liberal justice, like the ones Barack Obama has imposed on us already.DICKERSON: O.K. Thank you, Senator.Governor Bush, I would like to ask you, conservatives for a long time have felt like that their Republican presidents have picked justices that didnt turn out to be real conservatives.BUSH: Right.DICKERSON: Bernie Sanders has said he would have a litmus test. He would make sure that he appointed a justice who was going to overturn Citizens United. If they can have a litmus test for a nominee, what about you? Would you have a litmus test for a nominee? And what would it be?BUSH: Not on specific issues, not at all. I think the next president  if Im president, I will appoint people  Ill nominate people that have a proven record in the judiciary.The problem in the past has been we have appointed people thinking you can get it through the Senate because they didnt have a record. And the problem is that sometimes were surprised.The simple fact is the next president needs to appoint someone with a proven conservative record, similar to Justice Scalia, that is a lover of liberty, that believes in limited government, that consistently applied that kind of philosophy, that didnt try to legislator from the bench, that was respectful of the Constitution.And then fight and fight, and fight for that nomination to make sure that that nomination passes.Of course, the president, by the way, has every right to nominate Supreme Court justices. Im an Article II guy in the Constitution. Were running for the president of the United States. We want a strong executive for sure. But in return for that, there should be a consensus orientation on that nomination, and theres no doubt in my mind that Barack Obama will not have a consensus pick when he submits that person to the Senate.DICKERSON: Right, so, Senator Cruz, the Constitution...(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: So, Senator Cruz, the Constitution says the president shall appoint with advice and consent from the Senate, just to clear that up. So he has the constitutional power. But you dont think he should.Where do you set that date if youre president? Does it begin in election year, in December, November, September? And once you set the date, when youre president, will you abide by that date?CRUZ: Well, we have 80 years of precedent of not confirming Supreme Court justices in an election year. And let me say, Justice Scalia...DICKERSON: Just can I  Im sorry to interrupt, were any appointed in an election year, or is that just there were 80 years...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Eighty years of not confirming. For example, L.B.J. nominated Abe Fortas. Fortas did not get confirmed. He was defeated.DICKERSON: But Kennedy was confirmed in 88.CRUZ: No, Kennedy was confirmed in 87...DICKERSON: He was appointed in 87.CRUZ: He was appointed in...DICKERSON: ... confirmed in 88. Thats the question, is it appointing or confirming, whats the difference?CRUZ: In this case its both. But if I could answer the question...DICKERSON: Sorry, I just want to get the facts straight for the audience. But I apologize.(BOOING)(LAUGHTER)CRUZ: Justice Scalia was a legal giant. He was somebody that I knew for 20 years. He was a brilliant man. He was faithful to the Constitution. He changed the arc of American legal history. And Ill tell you, his passing tonight, our prayers are with his family, with his wife, Maureen, who he adored, his nine children, his 36 grandkids. But it underscores the stakes of this election. We are one justice away from a Supreme Court that will strike down every restriction on abortion adopted by the states. We are one justice away from a Supreme Court that will reverse the Heller decision, one of Justice Scalias seminal decisions, that upheld the Second Amendment right to keep and to bear arms.We are one justice away from a Supreme Court that would undermine the religious liberty of millions of Americans  and the stakes of this election, for this year, for the Senate, the Senate needs to stand strong and say, Were not going to give up the U.S. Supreme Court for a generation by allowing Barack Obama to make one more liberal appointee.And then for the state of South Carolina, one of the most important judgments for the men and women of South Carolina to make is who on this stage has the background, the principle, the character, the judgment and the strength of resolve to nominate and confirm principled constitutionalists to the court? That will be what I will do if Im elected president.DICKERSON: All right.(APPLAUSE)Thank you, Senator Cruz. All right, were going to move on to national security here, and we are going to  I want to read a quote from Secretary Robert Gates, former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who served for eight year  under eight presidents.And this is what he said about Republican candidates, quote, Part of the concern that I have with the campaign is that the solutions being offered are so simplistic and so at odds with the way the world really works.So, in that spirit, were going to work tonight to be more specific.Mr. Trump, I want to start with you. You have said as president, youll get up to speed very quickly. Youll know more quickly as president than any of the experts.So, youve been elected president. Its your first day in the Situation Room. What three questions do you ask your national security experts about the world?TRUMP: What we want to do, when we want to do it, and how hard do we want to hit? Because we are going to have to hit very, very hard to knock out ISIS.Were going to also have to learn who our allies are. We have allies, so-called allies, were spending billions and billions of dollars supporting people  we have no idea who they are in Syria. Do we want to stay that route, or do we want to go and make something with Russia?I hate to say Iran, but with Russia, because we  and the Iran deal is one of the worst deals I have ever seen negotiated in my entire life. Its a disgrace that this country negotiated that deal. But very important...(APPLAUSE)Not only a disgrace, its a disgrace and an embarrassment. But very important, who are we fighting with? Who are we fighting for? What are we doing? We have to rebuild our country. But we have to  Im the only one on this stage that said: Do not go into Iraq. Do not attack Iraq. Nobody else on this stage said that. And I said it loud and strong. And I was in the private sector. I wasnt a politician, fortunately.But I said it, and I said it loud and clear, Youll destabilize the Middle East. Thats exactly what happened.I also said, by the way, four years ago, three years ago, attack the oil, take the wealth away, attack the oil and keep the oil. They didnt listen. They just started that a few months ago.(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Senator Rubio  just 30 seconds on this question, Senator Rubio. Are those the questions you would ask?RUBIO: No. I think there are three major threats that you want to immediately get on top of. No. 1 is, what are we doing in the Asia-Pacific region, where both North Korea and China pose threats to the national security of the United States.No. 2 is, what are we doing in the Middle East with the combination of the Sunni-Shia conflict driven by the Shia arc that Iran is now trying to establish in the Middle East, also the growing threat of ISIS.And the third is rebuilding and reinvigorating NATO in the European theater, particularly in Central Europe and in Eastern Europe, where Vladimir Putin is now threatening the territory of multiple countries, already controls 20 percent of Georgia and a significant percentage of Ukraine.DICKERSON: Let me ask you a follow-up, a full, proper question, then.(APPLAUSE)Violent extremists are operating or active in 40 countries. Some 80 countries are in different degrees of instability. And so, thats just the crises overseas. Barack Obama walked into an economic collapse when he came into office. We face international health crises, from Ebola to Zika.So, there is a lot of opportunity for crisis, as you have talked about. What would you point to in your past to show voters that youve been in a crisis and that youve been tested when that inevitable crisis comes when youre president?RUBIO: Well, let me tell you what has happened a couple of years ago. One of the hardest decisions youll ever make in Congress is when you are asked by the president to authorize the use of force in a conflict, because you are now putting your name, on behalf of the people of your state, behind a military action, where Americans in uniform could lose their life.So, in 2014, Barack Obama said he would not take military action against Assad unless it was authorized by the Senate, beginning on the Committee of Foreign Relations, where I am one of its members. And it was hard because you looked at the pictures. I saw the same images people saw. Im the father of children. I saw the images of these little children  been gassed and poisoned by their own leaders, and we were angry. Something had to happen, and there was the sense that we needed to seek retribution.And then I looked at Barack Obamas plan. Barack Obamas plan, which John Kerry later described as unbelievably small, and I concluded that that attack would not only not help the situation, it would make it actually worse. It would allow Assad to stand up to the United States of America, survive a strike, stay in power and actually strengthen his grip.So it was a difficult decision to make, and when we only had a few days to look at and make a decision on it, and I voted against Barack Obamas plan to use force, and it was the right decision.DICKERSON: Dr. Carson, I want to ask you a question...(APPLAUSE)Dr. Carson, you said youve had more 2 a.m.  2 a.m. phone calls than anybody up on this stage. But when those 2 a.m. phone calls came, you operated on a foundation of all of that amazing medical work that you did, all of that learning. So if you were to be president, though, you wouldnt have the political foundation that hones those instincts when the 2 a.m. phone call comes. So isnt that a liability?CARSON: No, it isnt. First of all, let me go back to your first question for me. It wasnt phrased as who gets to nominate Supreme Court appointees. Of course thats the president. So I know that there are some left-wing media who would try to make hay on that.Secondly, thank you for including me in the debate. Two questions already. This is great. Now, as far...(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)As far as those 2 a.m. phone calls are concerned, judgment is what is required. And the kinds of things that you come up with are sometimes very, very difficult and very unique. One of the things that I was known for is doing things that have not been done before. So no amount of experience really prepares you to do something that has never been done before. Thats where judgment comes in.And that, I think, is a situation that were in right now, a situation that we have never been in before with the kinds of threats that pose real danger to our nation, and it comes in very handy in those situations.DICKERSON: Governor Kasich, Russia is being credited...(APPLAUSE)Russia is being credited with bombing U.S.-backed rebels on behalf of Assad in Aleppo and Syria. Theyve also moved into the Crimea, eastern Ukraine. Youve said you want to punch them in the nose. What does that mean? What are you going to do?KASICH: First of all  yes. First of all, look, we have to make it clear to Russia what we expect. We dont have to declare an enemy, rattle a sword or threaten, but we need to make it clear what we expect. No. 1 is we will arm the folks in Ukraine who are fighting for their freedom. They deserve it. There will be no ifs, ands or buts about it.Secondly, an attack on NATO, trumped up on any excuse of Russian-speaking people, either in the NATO countries or in Finland or Sweden, is going to be an attack on us. And look, I think we have an opportunity as America to put something really great together again.The Egyptians, the Saudis, the Jordanians, the Gulf states, they all know theyre at risk. We need to look into Europe, we look at France, we look at Germany and the migrants. We look at Belgium, we look at Britain. Everybody now is being threatened by radical Islam. We have an opportunity to lead.You know, the fact of the matter is the world is desperate for our leadership. Sometimes they may  they may make a remark here or there that we dont like, but frankly, the world needs us. And we have an opportunity now to assemble a coalition of the civilized people, those who respect civilization, the rights of women, the rights to protest, to be able to reassert our leadership all across this globe again and make sure this century is going to be the best weve ever seen.DICKERSON: Governor...(APPLAUSE)Governor Bush.BUSH: Yes.DICKERSON: You said defeating ISIS requires defeating Assad. But wouldnt that also put us into conflict with Russia, a country that supports Assad? So doesnt that mean, effectively, Assads there to stay?BUSH: No, it doesnt, and thats the problem. The lack of leadership in this country by Barack Obama, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, thinking that this is a policy that works, this policy of containment with ISIS. Its a complete, unmitigated disaster. And to allow Russia now to have influence in Syria makes it harder, but we need to destroy ISIS and dispose of Assad to create a stable Syria so that the four million refugees arent a breeding ground for Islamic jihadists.This is the problem. Donald Trump brought up the fact that he would  hed want to accommodate Russia. Russia is not taking out ISIS. Theyre  theyre attacking our  our  our team, the team that weve been training and the team that weve been supporting. It is absolutely ludicrous to suggest that Russia could be a positive partner in this. They are on the run. They are making  every time we step back, theyre on the run. The question that you asked was a really good one about what you would do  what three things would you do.I would restore the military, the sequester needs to be reversed. I would have a strategy to destroy ISIS, and I would immediately create a policy of containment as it relates to Irans ambitions, and to make it make clear that we are not going to allow for Iran to do what its doing, which is to move towards a nuclear weapon.Those three things would be the first and foremost things that we need to do...(BELL RINGING)BUSH: ... in 2017.DICKERSON: Mr. Trump, youre...(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Mr. Trump, you were mentioned here. You did say that you could get along very well with Vladimir Putin. You did at one point say let Russia take care of ISIS...TRUMP: ... (INAUDIBLE) called me a genius, I like him so far, I have to tell you. Let me just tell you this.Jeb is so wrong. Jeb is absolutely self  just so you understand, you know what that is? Thats Jebs special interest and lobbyist talking.Look, let me just tell you something, Jeb  Jeb is so wrong. You got to fight ISIS first. You fight ISIS first. Right now you have Russia, you have Iran, you have them with Assad, and you have them with Syria. You have to knock out ISIS. Theyre chopping off heads. These are animals. You have to knock em out. You have to knock them off strong. You decide what to do after, you cant fight two wars at one time.If you listen to him, and you listen to some of the folks that Ive been listening to, thats why weve been in the Middle East for 15 years, and we havent won anything. Weve spent $5 trillion dollars in the Middle East with thinking like that. Weve spent $5...(BELL RINGING)TRUMP: Lindsey Graham, who backs him, had zero on his polls. Let me just say something  weve spent  weve spent.I only tell the truth, lobbyists.Weve spent $5 trillion dollars all over the  we have to rebuild our country. We have to rebuild our infrastructure. You listen to that, youre going to be there for another 15...DICKERSON: ... All right...TRUMP: ... Youll end up with World War III...DICKERSON: ... All right, Governor Bush, please respond.BUSH: The very basic fact is that Vladimir Putin is not going to be an ally of the United States. The whole world knows this. Its a simple, basic fact.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: Theyre not taking out  theyre not even attempting to take out ISIS. Theyre attacking the troops that were supporting. We need to create a coalition, Sunni-led coalition on the ground with our special operators to destroy ISIS and bring about stability. And you cant do that with Assad in power. He has...TRUMP: ... Were supporting troops...BUSH: ... Let me finish...TRUMP: ... that we dont even know who they are.DICKERSON: ... O.K., settle...BUSH: ... This is ridiculous...TRUMP: ... Were supporting troops that we dont even know who they are...DICKERSON: ... All right, Mr. Trump, all right...TRUMP: We have no idea who they are.DICKERSON: Gentleman, I think were going to leave that there. Ive got a question for Senator...BUSH: ... This is coming from a guy who gets his foreign policy from the shows.TRUMP: ... Oh, yeah, yeah...BUSH: ... This is a guy who thinks that Hillary Clinton is a great negotiator in Iran...TRUMP: ... Let 44 million in New Hampshire, it was practically (INAUDIBLE)...BUSH: ... This is a man who insults his way to the nomination...TRUMP: ... 44 million  give me a break.(CROSSTALK)DICKERSON: ... All right, all right, gentlemen, gentlemen, lets leave it there so I can ask a question of Senator Cruz, whos also running for president.(LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Senator Cruz, you talked about the first Gulf War as being a kind of model for your focused and determined effort to go after ISIS. But there were 700,000 ground troops as a part of that, and you dont have a ground component to your plan. Why?CRUZ: Well, we need to focus on what the objective is, you know? Your question about the first three questions you would ask in this Situation Room. I think it is a problem if the president, commander in chief, weve elected does not have the experience and background to understand the threats facing this country coming in on Day 1.If you look at the threats facing this country, the single gravest threat, national security threat, is the threat of a nuclear Iran. Thats why Ive pledged on Day 1 to rip to shreds this Iranian nuclear deal, and anyone that thinks you can negotiate Khamenei does not understand the nature of Khamenei.When it comes to ISIS, weve got to have a focused objective. One of the problems of Barack Obama and Hillary Clintons foreign policy, and, sadly, too many establishment Republicans in Washington, is they focus on issues unrelated to protecting this country. They focus on nation building, they focus on toppling governments to promote democracy, and it ends up undermining our national security.Now, with regard to ISIS, we need a commander in chief that sets the objective we will utterly defeat them because they have declared war. Theyve declared a jihad on us.Now, what do we need...(BELL RINGING)CRUZ: ... to carry that out. We need overwhelming air power, we need to arm the Kurds, who can be our boots on the ground, and if ground troops are necessary, then we should employ them, but it shouldnt be politicians demonstrating political toughness. It should be military expert judgment carrying out the objectives set out by the commander in chief.(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Very quickly, 30-second follow-up. Youve said that, essentially, the Kurds would be the American ground forces in there. The criticism that experts have on that is that the Kurds only can work within their territory.If they take larger amounts of territory, you have an ethnic war with the Arabs. So the Kurds cant really do as much as you seem to be putting on their backs.CRUZ: We have Kurds in both Iraq and Syria. They are fighting ISIS right now. They are winning victories right now. ISIS is using American military equipment theyve seized in Iraq. And the Obama administration refuses to arm the Kurds, the pesh merga, the fighting forces who have been longtime allies.We ought to be arming them and letting them fight. Now, if we need to embed Special Forces to direct our overwhelming air power, if it is required to use ground troops to defeat ISIS, we should use them, but we ought to start with using our incredible air power advantage.The first Persian Gulf War, we launched 1,100 air attacks a day. Today, were launching between 15 and 30. Were not using the tools we have, and its because the commander in chief is not focused on defeating the enemy.DICKERSON: All right. Mr. Trump...(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: ... On Monday, George W. Bush will campaign in South Carolina for his brother. As youve said tonight, and youve often said, the Iraq war and your opposition to it was a sign of your good judgment.In 2008, in an interview with Wolf Blitzer, talking about President George W. Bushs conduct of the war, you said you were surprised that Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi didnt try to impeach him.You said, quote: Which, personally, I think would have been a wonderful thing. When you were asked what you meant by that and you said: For the war, for the war, he lied, he got us into the war with lies. Do you still believe President Bush should have been impeached?TRUMP: First of all, I have to say, as a businessman, I get along with everybody. I have business all over the world.(BOOING)TRUMP: I know so many of the people in the audience. And by the way, Im a self-funder. I dont have  I have my wife and I have my son. Thats all I have. I dont have this.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: So let me just tell you, I get along with everybody, which is my obligation to my company, to myself, et cetera.Obviously, the war in Iraq was a big, fat mistake. All right? Now, you can take it any way you want, and it took  it took Jeb Bush, if you remember at the beginning of his announcement, when he announced for president, it took him five days.He went back, it was a mistake, it wasnt a mistake. It took him five days before his people told him what to say, and he ultimately said, It was a mistake. The war in Iraq, we spent $2 trillion, thousands of lives, we dont even have it. Iran has taken over Iraq, with the second-largest oil reserves in the world.Obviously, it was a mistake.DICKERSON: So...TRUMP: George Bush made a mistake. We can make mistakes. But that one was a beauty. We should have never been in Iraq. We have destabilized the Middle East.DICKERSON: But so Im going to  so you still think he should be impeached?BUSH: I think its my turn, isnt it?TRUMP: You do whatever you want. You call it whatever you want. I want to tell you. They lied. They said there were weapons of mass destruction, there were none. And they knew there were none. There were no weapons of mass destruction.(BOOING)DICKERSON: All right. O.K. All right.Governor Bush  when a member on the stages brother gets attacked...BUSH: Ive got about five or six...DICKERSON: ... the brother gets to respond.BUSH: Do I get to do it five or six times or just once, responding to that?TRUMP: Im being nice.BUSH: So heres the deal. Im sick and tired of Barack Obama blaming my brother for all of the problems that he has had.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: And, frankly, I could care less about the insults that Donald Trump gives to me. Its blood sport for him. He enjoys it. And Im glad hes happy about it. But I am sick and tired...TRUMP: He spent $22 million in...(CROSSTALK)BUSH: I am sick and tired of him going after my family. My dad is the greatest man alive in my mind.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: And while Donald Trump was building a reality TV show, my brother was building a security apparatus to keep us safe. And Im proud of what he did.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: And he has had the gall to go after my brother.TRUMP: The World Trade Center came down during your brothers reign, remember that.(BOOING)BUSH: He has had the gall to go after my mother.Hold on. Let me finish. He has had the gall to go after my mother.TRUMP: Thats not keeping us safe.BUSH: Look, I won the lottery when I was born 63 years ago, looked up, and I saw my mom. My mom is the strongest woman I know.TRUMP: She should be running.BUSH: This is not about my family or his family. This is about the South Carolina families that need someone to be a commander in chief that can lead. Im that person.DICKERSON: Governor Kasich, would you weigh in on...(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Governor Kasich, please weigh in.KASICH: Ive got to tell you, this is just crazy, huh?(LAUGHTER)KASICH: This is just nuts, O.K.? Jeez, oh, man. Im sorry, John.DICKERSON: Why is it nuts? Talk about it. Give us your sense of...KASICH: Oh, well, listen, I think being in Iraq, look, we thought there were weapons of mass destruction. Colin Powell, who is one of the most distinguished generals in modern time, said there were weapons there.(APPLAUSE)KASICH: But, but, the fact is we got ourselves in the middle of a civil war. The Sunni, the Shia and the Kurds, never gotten along. In fact, that country was drawn  the borders of that country were drawn after World War I by Westerners that didnt understand what was happening there. The tragedy of it is that were still embroiled. And, frankly, if there werent weapons of mass destruction, we should never have gone. I dont believe the United States should involve itself in civil wars. Civil wars are not in our direct interest, and if you  and look, I served on a defense committee for 18 years and was called into the Pentagon after 9/11 by Secretary Rumsfeld to deal with some of the most serious problems that we faced.The fact is, is that we should go to war when it is our direct interest. We should not be policemen of the world, but when we go, we mean business. Well do our job. Well tell our soldiers, our people in the service, take care of your job and then come home once weve accomplished our goals.Thats what we need to do.DICKERSON: Thirty seconds, Senator Rubio.RUBIO: I just want to say, at least on behalf of me and my family, I thank God all the time it was George W. Bush in the White House on 9/11 and not Al Gore.(APPLAUSE)And you can  I think you can look back in hindsight and say a couple of things, but he kept us safe. And not only did he keep us safe, but no matter what you want to say about weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was in violation of U.N. resolutions, in open violation, and the world wouldnt do anything about it, and George W. Bush enforced what the international community refused to do.And again, he kept us safe, and I am forever grateful to what he did for this country.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: How did he keep us safe when the World Trade Center  the World  excuse me. I lost hundreds of friends. The World Trade Center came down during the reign of George Bush. He kept us safe? That is not safe. That is not safe, Marco. That is not safe.RUBIO: The World Trade Center came down because Bill Clinton didnt kill Osama bin Laden when he had the chance to kill him.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: And George Bush  by the way, George Bush had the chance, also, and he didnt listen to the advice of his C.I.A.DICKERSON: All right, Dr. Carson, we have a cleansing...BUSH: Can I just...DICKERSON: We have a cleansing...BUSH: Im not going to invite Donald Trump to the rally in Charleston on Monday afternoon when my brother is coming to speak.TRUMP: I dont want to go.(LAUGHTER)BUSH: Im rescinding the invitation. I thought you might want to come, but I guess not.DICKERSON: All right. Well, Dr. Carson, I have got a question now for you.A moment of pause here. You have said, Dr. Carson, that  referring to yourself, that people bought into the idea that, quote, A nice person cant be tough on terrorists.You have called for loosening the rules of engagement for the military, which could lead to more civilian casualties.So, explain why those casualties would be acceptable in the fight against ISIS?CARSON: Well, first of all, let me just address the Iraq question.You know, I was not particularly in favor of us going to war in Iraq, primarily because I have studied, you know, the Middle East, recognizing that those are nations that are ruled by dictators and have been for thousands of years. And when you go in and you remove one of those dictators, unless you have an appropriate plan for replacing them, youre going to have chaos.Now, fortunately, we were able to stabilize the situation, and it was the current administration that turned tail and ran and destabilized the situation.(APPLAUSE)Now, having said that, in terms of the rules of engagement, I was talking about, you know, Obama has said, you know, we shouldnt bomb tankers, you know, coming out of refineries because there may be people in there, or because the environment may be hurt.You know, thats just asinine thinking. And the fact of the matter is...(APPLAUSE)You know, we  obviously, youre not going to accomplish all of your goals without some collateral damage. You have to be able to assess what is acceptable and what is not.DICKERSON: All right, thank you, Dr. Carson.Were going to have to take a commercial break here. Thank you to all the candidates. Well be right back with CBS Newss 2016 debate in Greenville, South Carolina.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)DICKERSON: Were back with the Republicans who could be president. The topic now is money and how the candidates would spend it. Well turn the questioning over to Kimberley Strassel of The Wall Street Journal and Major Garrett of CBS News. Kim?STRASSEL: Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Yes.STRASSEL: You have made a lot of promises and you have also  youre the only candidate who has said he would not touch entitlements. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has estimated that your ideas would cost an additional $12 trillion to $15 trillion over the next 10 years and that we would have to have annual economic growth of anywhere from 7.7 percent to 9 percent annually to pay for them. Are you proposing more than you can actually deliver, at least not without big deficits?TRUMP: First of all, the  when you say Im the only candidate, if you listen to the Democrats, they want to do many things to Social Security, and I want to do them on its own merit. You listen to them, what they want to do to Social Security, none of these folks are getting elected, O.K., whether they can do it or not. Im going to save Social Security. Im going to bring jobs back from China. Im going to bring jobs back from Mexico and from Japan, where theyre all  every country throughout the world  now Vietnam, thats the new one.They are taking our jobs. They are taking our wealth. They are taking our base. And you and I have had this discussion. Were going to make our economy strong again. Im lowering taxes. We have $2.5 trillion offshore. We have 2.5 trillion that I think is actually five trillion because the government has no idea when they say 2.5, they have no idea what theyre doing or saying, as theyve proven very well.Were going to bring that money back. You take a look at what happened just this week. China bought the Chicago Stock Exchange, China, a Chinese company. Carrier is moving to Mexico, air conditioning company. Not only the ones I talk about all the time, Nabisco and Ford and  theyre all moving out.We have an economy that last quarter, G.D.P. didnt grow. It was flat. We have to make our economy grow again. Were dying. This country is dying. And our workers are losing their jobs, and youre going...STRASSEL: But in terms of...TRUMP: Im the only one who is going to save Social Security, believe me.STRASSEL: O.K. But how would you actually do that? Can I ask you? Because right now, Social Security and Medicare...TRUMP: Because you have tremendous waste. Ill tell you...STRASSEL: They take up two-thirds of the federal budget, and theyre growing.TRUMP: You have tremendous waste, fraud and abuse. That were taking care of. That were taking care of. Its tremendous. We have in Social Security right now thousands and thousands of people that are over 106 years old. Now, you know they dont exist. They dont exist. Theres tremendous waste, fraud and abuse, and were going to get it. But were not going to hurt the people who have been paying into Social Security their whole life and then all of a sudden theyre supposed to get less. Were bringing our jobs back. Were going to make our economy great again.GARRETT: Senator Cruz.(APPLAUSE)John mentioned this is about dollars and incentives. We also want to talk about economic growth engagements. You have proposed a consumption tax, you called it the back tax. Some analysts compare it more to an attributed value-added tax.From the perspective from economic growth in building wages, how does that work, and how would you address those longstanding conservative concerns that something approaching the value-added tax would be used to constantly increase those rates to pay for future government spending and become an escalator of taxation, not of growth?CRUZ: Well, let me say it at the outset that everyone here understands  everyone understands that how  that the middle class has been left behind in the last seven years of the Obama economy, and weve got to bring jobs back. Weve got to get people back to work. Weve got to get wages going up again. Weve got to get people moving from part-time work to full-time work.We all agree on that, but its not going to be solved with magic pixie dust. Its just going to be solved by declaring into the air, Let there be jobs. We actually have to understand the principles that made America great in the first place.Now, where do you get economic growth? If you look at cause and effect over our nations history, every time we lessen the burden of Washington on small-business owners, on job creators, we see incredible economic growth. You do that through tax reform and regulatory reform.My tax plan  typical family of four, first $36,000 you earn, you pay nothing in taxes  no income taxes, no payroll taxes, no nothing. Above 10 percent, everyone pays the same simple, flat 10 percent income rate. Its flat and fair. You can fill out your taxes on a postcard, and we abolish the I.R.S. If you want to see the postcard, Ive got it on my website.GARRETT: Now, the question  conservatives have sort of this idea conceptually for a long time, but especially on this consumption value-added tax system. In Europe, where it exists, it has become an escalator of taxation to feed government spending, and thats why conservatives have long resisted it. Why and what would you do as president to make sure that doesnt happen?CRUZ: Now, Major, the business flat tax that is in my tax plan is not a VAT. A VAT in Europe is a sales tax. The business flat tax is not a sales tax, it is a tax of 16 percent opposed fairly and evenly across the board on all business.One of the things thats critical is were doing that in conjunction with abolishing the corporate income tax, with abolishing the Obamacare taxes, with abolishing the payroll taxes, which are the biggest taxes paid by most working Americans, and with abolishing the death tax, which is cruel and unfair. And you asked about economic growth  the nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimated a simple flat tax that would produce 4.9 million new jobs, it would increase capital investment by 44 percent and would lift everyones income by double digits.Thats how you turn the country around, not just hoping and praying for it, but implementing policies that work.STRASSEL: O.K., I have a question, a related tax question.Senator Rubio, you have the highest tax rate of anyone up on the stage in terms of the top tax rates, 35 percent. Some economists say, It would limit its potential to boost economic growth. You do that so that you will have more revenue to pay for a tripling of the Child Tax Credit.Normally, its liberals who like to use the tax code to insert social policy. Why should conservatives who want to tax adopt the other sides approach?RUBIO: Well, because Im influencing social policy  this is their money. This is the money of parents. You dont earn the tax credit unless youre working. Thats your money, it doesnt belong to government.Heres what I dont understand. If a business takes their money and they invest in the piece of the equipment, they get to write off their taxes. But if a parent takes money that they have earned to work and invests in their children, they dont? This makes no sense.Parenting is the most important job any of us will ever have. Family formation is the most important thing in society. So what my tax plan does, is it does create, especially for working families, an additional Child Tax Credit. So that parents who are working get to keep more of their own money, not the governments money, to invest in their children to go to school, to go to a private school, to buy a new backpack.Let me tell you, if youre a parent thats struggling, then you know that $50 a month is the difference between a new pair of shoes this month or not getting a new pair of shoes for your kids. Im going to have a tax plan that is pro-family, because the family is the most important institution in society. You cannot have a strong country without strong families.(APPLAUSE)STRASSEL: Governor Kasich, this on is on size of government. In 2013, you pushed through a Medicaid reform in your state over the rejections of many of the Republicans in your state. Total enrollment and overall cost of program have gone well beyond what anyone had expected, including yourself. How can you argue that this overall growth fits in with conservative ambition to significantly cut back on the size of federal welfare programs?KASICH: Yeah. Well, first of all, those numbers, incorrect. We are  our Medicaid programs are coming in below cost estimates, and our Medicaid program in the second year grew at 2.5 percent.And Kimberley, let me tell you, when we expand Medicaid and we treat the mentally ill, then they dont live under a bridge or live in a prison, where they cost $22,500 a year.When we take the drug addicted and we treat them in the prisons, we stop the revolving door of people in and out of prisons, and we save $22,500 a year.Guess what else? They get their lives back. And the working poor, theyre now getting health care. And you know that about a third of the people who are now getting that health care are people who are suffering very serious illnesses, particularly cancer.So, what I would tell you is, weve gone from an $8 billion hole to a $2 billion surplus. Weve cut taxes by more than any governor in America by $5 billion. We have grown the number of jobs by 400,000 private-sector jobs since Ive been governor.Our credit is strong. Our pensions are strong. And frankly, we leave no one behind. Economic growth is not an end unto itself. We want everyone to rise, and we will make them personally responsible for the help that they get.And that is exactly the program were driving in Ohio. And, boy, people ought to look at Ohio, because it has got a good formula.(APPLAUSE)GARRETT: Governor Bush, a question for you  but if you want to jump in, please.BUSH: Id like  can I  can I...GARRETT: Jump in, and then Ive got a question for you.BUSH: Look, I admire the fact that Governor Kasich is supporting spending more money on drug treatment and mental health. I think thats a high priority all across this country, but expanding Obamacare is what were talking about, and Obamacares expansion, even though the federal government is paying for the great majority of it, is creating further debt on the backs of our children and grandchildren. We should be fighting Obamacare, repealing Obamacare, replacing it with something totally different.(APPLAUSE)When I was  as a private citizen, Florida was confronted with the choice. The governor was supportive of doing what John did. So was the Florida Senate. A committed speaker of the House asked me to go as a private citizen to make the case against the expansion.I did, and it wasnt expanded there, just as it wasnt expanded in South Carolina under Governor Haley.(CROSSTALK)GARRETT: Real quickly, jump in, because I have got a question for Governor Bush, but jump in.KASICH: Yeah, let me say a couple of things.First of all, when Jeb was governor, his first four years as governor, he expand  his Medicaid program grew twice as fast as mine. O.K.? Its just a fact.Now, with Obamacare, Ive not only sued the administration, I did not set up an exchange. And he knows that Im not for Obamacare, never have been. But heres whats interesting about Medicaid.You know who expanded Medicaid five times to try to help the folks and give them opportunity so that you could rise and get a job? President Ronald Reagan.Now, the fact of the matter is, we expanded to get people on their feet, and once theyre on their feet, we are giving them the training and the efforts that they need to be able to get work and pull out of that situation.GARRETT: Understood, Governor Kasich.KASICH: Thats what were doing in our state.BUSH: South Carolina  South Carolinians need to know this, because the Cato Institute, which grades governors based on their spending, rank him right at the bottom.GARRETT: Yeah, Governor Bush, fine.BUSH: And Governor Haley is ranked at the top.(CROSSTALK)GARRETT: Let me get in a question from...BUSH: No. He mentioned my name.GARRETT: I understand, I understand.BUSH: Let me finish, though. No, no, no  hey, wait, wait, wait. Just hold, Major, hold, Major. Hold on, Major.(CROSSTALK)BUSH: South Carolinians want to make that, they elect the most conservative governor or candidate that can win.KASICH: Let me  lets tell you...GARRETT: I have a question on economic growth, Governor Bush.(APPLAUSE)KASICH: Major  Major, we cant  weve got to  look, I have got to correct the record. And the fact of the matter is, we went from an $8 billion hole to a $2 billion surplus. Were up 400,000 jobs. Our credit is rock solid.And I dont know...GARRETT: A (INAUDIBLE), Governor.KASICH: Look, the bottom line is the people of this  of this country and this state want to see everybody rise, and they want to see unity, and I dont want to get into all this fighting tonight, because people are frankly sick of the negative campaigning.GARRETT: I know, understood. Governor Bush.KASICH: And Im going to stay positive about what I want to do from the...(APPLAUSE)GARRETT: Governor Bush, from the perspective, economic growth  viewed from this perspective of economic growth, you have proposed a tax on hedge fund managers.The Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative tax group youre probably aware of, has said no Republican should be for higher taxes on capital gains. And many conservatives wonder if this proposal of yours would undermine not only that philosophy, but undercut your projection of 4 percent economic growth annually under your presidency?BUSH: Of course not. It wont have an impact on hedge funds managers paying ordinary income. In fact, its not just hedge fund people, but people that are doing  theyre in the business of investing other peoples money, getting capital gains treatment is not appropriate.They should be paying ordinary income. Thats their business. Theyre grateful to be able to make a lot of money, Im sure. And what we do is lower the rates. Its not the end of the world that private equity people and hedge fund folks that are, right now, getting capital gains treatment for the income they earn, pay ordinary income like everybody else in this room. Thats not a problem at all. What we need to do is reform the tax code to simplify the rates, to shift power away from Washington, D.C. Thats what I did as governor of the state of Florida, $19 billion dollars of tax cuts, and it stimulated seven out of the eight years. Florida led the nation in job growth.(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Dr. Carson, before we go to break, could you give us your sense of this conversation about either Medicaid or economic growth through taxation?CARSON: Well, first of all, let me just mention on the tax issue. Bencarson.com, go read about it, because my tax plan has been praised by Cato, by Wall Street Journal. Forbes said it is the best, the most pro-growth tax plan, and its based on real fairness for everybody. Starts at the 150 percent poverty level, but even the people below that have to pay something, because everybody has to have skin in the game, and the millions of people cant, you know, talk about what other people have to pay and have no skin in the game.And it deals with corporate tax rate, and makes it the same as everybody else...(BELL RINGING)CARSON: ... Everybody pays exactly the same.DICKERSON: Doctor...CARSON: ... And, as far as Medicare and Medicaid, my main goal is to get rid of Obamacare and put the care back in the hands of (INAUDIBLE)...GARRETT: ... Dr. Carson...DICKERSON: ... Dr. Carson, Im sorry, we have to go to a commercial. The free market wants what it wants.Back soon with the 2016 Republican debate in Greenville, South Carolina.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)DICKERSON: Welcome back. Well begin the second half of the debate with one of the hottest issues in the Republican campaign, immigration. But before I turn it back to Major Garrett and Kim Strassel, I have one question for Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump, in the Republican National Committees Spanish-language response to the State of the Union, Congressman Diaz-Balart said, quote, Its essential that we find a legislative solution, talking about immigration, to offer a permanent and humane solution to those who live in the shadows. What does that mean to you, a humane solution to those who live in the shadows?TRUMP: I want everybody taken care of, but we have to take care of our people in this country. Were not taking care of our people. We have no border. We have no control. People are flooding across. We cant have it. We either have a border, and Im very strongly  Im not proposing. I will build a wall. I will build a wall.Remember this, the wall will be paid for by Mexico. We are not being treated right.(APPLAUSE)We are not being treated properly. If we dont have borders, if we dont have strength, we dont have a country. People are flowing across. We have to take care of our people. Believe me.GARRETT: Senator Rubio...(APPLAUSE)For the purposes of the lines  lines you would draw legislatively as a president on immigration reform, define amnesty.RUBIO: Well, first of all, I think amnesty is the forgiveness of a wrongdoing without consequence and that  Ive never supported that. I do not support that. I think there has to be consequences for violating our immigration laws. What I think is clear about this issue to begin with is were not going to be able to make progress on illegal immigration until first, illegal immigration is brought under control.You go back to 1986, when they legalized three million people and they promised to secure the border. It didnt happen, and as a result, people have lost trust in the federal government. It is now clear that the only way to make progress on immigration is not just to pass a law that enforces the law, but actually prove to people that its working.They want to see the wall built. They want to see the additional border agents. They want to see E-Verify. They want to see an entry-exit tracking system. Forty percent of the people in this country illegally are entering legally and overstaying visas. And only after all of that is in place, then well see what the American people are willing to support on this issue.I think the American people will be very reasonable, but responsible, about how you handle someone who has been here a long time, who can pass a background check, who pays a fine and starts paying taxes and all they want is a work permit. But you cant do any of that until you prove to people that illegal immigration is under control once and for all.(APPLAUSE)STRASSEL: Senator Cruz. Senator Cruz, you have promised to deport illegal aliens. You have also promised to reverse President Obamas executive action that gives temporary amnesty to illegals brought here by their parent as children. As president, you would have the names and addresses of the some 800,000 of those that have registered under that action. Now, you have said that in this country, we shouldnt go door to door, look for illegals, but in this case you would have a list. Would you use it?CRUZ: Well, you know, your question highlights a sharp difference on immigration on this stage. You know, in a Republican primary, everyone talks tough on immigration. Everyone is against illegal immigration in a Republican primary. But as voters, weve been burned over and over again by people that give us a great campaign speech and they dont walk the walk.There are sharp differences on amnesty. If you look at the folks on this stage, when Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and establishment Republicans were leading the fight to pass a massive amnesty plan, I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and the American people and led the fight to defeat that amnesty plan.(APPLAUSE)STRASSEL: So would you  would you use the addresses?CRUZ: Now, that moment...STRASSEL: Would you pick them up?CRUZ: That moment was what Reagan would call a time for choosing. When it comes to deciding which side of the line youre on, the Rubio-Schumer amnesty plan...(BOOING)CRUZ: ... apparently supported by the donor class, which is why Washington supported it. The Rubio-Schumer amnesty plan passed the Senate, and it was on the verge of passing the House.House leadership intended to take it up and pass it with the Democrats overruling most of the Republicans. And the question for anyone on illegal immigration is, where were you in that fight? Where did you stand?You are right. There is a difference between Senator Rubio and me on this question.(CROSSTALK)STRASSEL: Senator Rubio, your reply.RUBIO: Were going to have to do this again, O.K.? When that issue was being debated, Ted Cruz, at a committee hearing, very passionately said, I want immigration reform to pass, I want people to be able to come out of the shadows. And he proposed an amendment that would legalized people here.Not only that, he proposed doubling the number of green cards. He proposed a 500 percent increase on guest workers. Now his position is different. Now he is a passionate opponent of all those things.So he either wasnt telling the truth then or he isnt telling the truth now, but to argue he is a purist on immigration is just not true.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: Major, I get a response to that.GARRETT: Very quickly, Senator Cruz.STRASSEL: All right. Senator Cruz. Your response, Senator Cruz.CRUZ: You know, the lines are very, very clear. Marco right now supports citizenship for 12 million people here illegally. I oppose citizenship. Marco stood on the debate stage and said that.But I would note not only that  Marco has a long record when it comes to amnesty. In the state of Florida, as speaker of the house, he supported in-state tuition for illegal immigrants. In addition to that, Marco went on Univision in Spanish and said he would not rescind President Obamas illegal executive amnesty on his first day in office.I have promised to rescind every single illegal executive action, including that one.(MIX OF APPLAUSE AND BOOING)CRUZ: And on the question...(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: Well, first of all, I dont know how he knows what I said on Univision, because he doesnt speak Spanish. And second of all, the other point that I would make...CRUZ: (SPEAKING SPANISH).RUBIO: Look, this is a disturbing pattern now, because for a number of weeks now, Ted Cruz has just been telling lies. He lied about Ben Carson in Iowa.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: He lies about Planned Parenthood. He lies about marriage. Hes lying about all sorts of things. And now he makes things up. The bottom line is this is a campaign and people are watching it. And they see the truth behind all these issues.And here is the truth, Ted Cruz supported legalizing people that were in this country...CRUZ: That is simply...(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: ... and only now does he say...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: That is absolutely false. What he said is knowingly false. And I would note, if you want to assess  if you want to assess...RUBIO: Well, well put on our website, marcorubio.com. Were going to...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: ... who is telling the truth...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: If you want to assess who is telling the truth...(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: ... then you should look to Jeff Sessions, who said, without Ted Cruz the Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill would have passed, and Ted was responsible. You should look to Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, that said...(CROSSTALK)GARRETT: Governor Bush, I want to bring this out to a little wider philosophical aspect, if you will.BUSH: Thank you.GARRETT: You have said illegal immigrants, quote, broke the law, but its not a felony, still quoting you, its an act of love, its an act of commitment to your family.Mr. Trump has, as you are well aware, denounced that statement over and over. Do you still believe it? What does that mean to you? And how does that inform your approach to immigration reform?BUSH: Great question. I feel like I have to get into my inner Chris Christie, and point out that the reason why I should be president is listening to two senators talk about arcane amendments to bills that didnt pass.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: This is  this is the problem. We need a leader to fix this problem. And I have a detailed plan to do just that, including controlling the border, dealing with the visa over-stayers, making sure that we have a path to legal status, not to citizenship, for those that come out from the shadows and pay a fine, learn English, dont commit crimes, work and pay taxes.That is the better approach.GARRETT: Fundamentally, do you believe this rhetoric is insufficiently compassionate to this issue?BUSH: The great majority of people that come to this country come because they have no other choice. They want to come to provide for their families. That doesnt mean its right. That doesnt mean its right.We should pick who comes to our country. We should control our border. Coming here legally should be a lot easier than coming here illegally. But the motivation, theyre not all rapists, as you-know-who said. Theyre not that.These are people that are coming to provide for their families. And we should show a little more respect for the fact that theyre struggling. It doesnt mean we shouldnt be controlling the border. Thats exactly what we should be doing.GARRETT: Mr. Trump...TRUMP: Look...(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: ... When I announced that I was running for president on June 16th, illegal immigration wasnt even a subject. If I didnt bring it up, we wouldnt even be talking. Now, I dont often agree with Marco, and I dont often agree with Ted, but I can in this case. The weakest person on this stage by far on illegal immigration is Jeb Bush. They come out of an act of love, whether you like it or not. He is so weak on illegal immigration its laughable, and everybody knows it.BUSH: ... So, you know...(BELL RINGING)BUSH: ... This is the standard operating procedure, to disparage me. Thats fine...TRUMP: ... Spend a little more money on the commercials...BUSH: ... But, if you want to talk about weakness, you want to talk about weakness? Its weak to disparage women.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: (INAUDIBLE). I dont know what youre talking about.BUSH: Its weak to denigrate the disabled. And,its really weak to call John McCain a loser because he was a...TRUMP: ... I never called him  I dont call him..BUSH: ... That is outrageous. The guys an American hero.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: He also said about language...BUSH: ... The simple fact is Ive also laid out my plans on (INAUDIBLE) immigration...TRUMP: ... Language. Two days ago he said he would take his pants off and moon everybody, and thats fine. Nobody reports that. He gets up and says that, and then he tells me, oh, my language was a little bit rough...STRASSEL: ... O.K....TRUMP: ... My language. Give me a break...GARRETT: ... Governor Kasich, here in South Carolina earlier this week, you said the idea, the concept of deporting 11 million undocumented workers...BUSH: (INAUDIBLE) Just, for the record (INAUDIBLE) make sure my mothers listening, if shes watching the debate. I didnt say that I was going to moon somebody...TRUMP: ... You did say it, you did say it. Been reported in 10 different news...GARRETT: ... We will leave the moon metaphors to be adjudicated later, I assure you. Governor Kasich, you said earlier this week in South Carolina, the concept, the idea of deporting 11 million undocumented workers in this country is nuts. Why is it you are so opposed to that idea? Senator Cruz has said its a simple application of existing law. The application of that is not inhumane, it is just. Why do you disagree?KASICH: Before I get to that, this is the ninth or 10th debate. What Ive been watching here, this back and forth, and these attacks, some of them are personal. I think were fixing to lose the election to Hillary Clinton if we dont stop this.(APPLAUSE)KASICH: I mean, the fact is  you know what? I would suggest, why dont we take off all the negative ads and all the negative comments down from television and let us just talk about what were for, and lets sell that, and the Republican Party will be stronger as a result...GARRETT: ... What are you for on immigration?KASICH: ... (OFF MIKE) (INAUDIBLE) First of all, Im for sealing the border, O.K.? And then Im for a guest worker program. People can come in, work and go back home. We havent closed the border because special interests, I believe, blocked it. Then, we have 11 and a half million people here. If they have not committed a crime since theyve been here, make them pay a fine and some back taxes, and give them a path to legalization, never to citizenship.It is not going to happen that were going to run around and try to drag 11 and a half million people out of their homes.Ill tell you this. Within the first hundred days, I will send a plan like this to the Congress of the United States, and if Im president, Ill bet you dollar to doughnuts right now, it will pass.(BELL RINGING)That is a reasonable proposal that the people of this country, in my judgment, will support, and so will the bulk of the Congress of the United States.(APPLAUSE)STRASSEL: Moving subjects. Dr. Carson, this week Morgan Stanley agreed to pay a $3.2 billion fine to state and federal authorities for contributing to the mortgage crisis. You have a lot of Democrats out saying that we should be jailing more executives, so two questions.Should financial executives be held legally responsible for financial crisis, and do you think fines like these are an effective way to deter companies from future behavior like that?CARSON: Well, first of all, please go to my website, bencarson.com, and read my immigration policy, O.K.? Because it actually makes sense.Now, the  as far as these fines are concerned, you know? Heres the big problem. Weve got all these government regulators, and all theyre doing is running around looking for people to fine. And weve got 645 different federal agencies and sub-agencies. Way, way too many, and they dont have anything else to do.I think what we really need to do is start trimming the regulatory agencies rather than going after the people who are trying to increase the viability, economic viability of our society. Now, that doesnt mean there arent some people out there who are doing bad things. But Im not sure that the way to solve that problem is by increasing all the regulatory burden. You know, when you consider how much regulations cost us each year, you know? $2 trillion dollars per family, $24,000 per family, that happens to be the same level as the poverty level...(BELL RINGING)CARSON: ... for a family of four. If you want to get rid of poverty, get rid of all the regulations.DICKERSON: Senator Cruz, I have a question for you. Speaker Paul Ryan has made a big commitment to trying to lift the 50 million poor out of poverty. Arthur Brooks, who is the president of the American Enterprise Institute, says, quote, If we are not warriors for the poor every day, free enterprise has no matter. How you have been, in your campaign, a warrior for the poor?CRUZ: I think it is a very important question because the people who have been hurt the most in the Obama economy had been the most vulnerable. Its been young people. Its been Hispanics. Its been African-Americans. Its been single moms. We have the lowest percentage of Americans working today in any year since 1977.And the sad reality is big government, massive taxes, massive regulation, doesnt work. What we need to do instead is bring back booming economic growth, let  small businesses are the heart of the economy. Two-thirds of all new jobs come from small businesses. If we want to lift people out of poverty  you know, I think of these issues from the perspective of my dad.My dad fled Cuba in 1957. He was just 18. He couldnt speak English. He had nothing. He had $100 in his underwear. And he washed dishes making 50 cents an hour and paid his way through school. Today, my dad is a pastor. He travels the country preaching the gospel.Now, I think about all of these issues. How would it impact my dad when he was washing dishes? If we had Obamacare in place right now, the odds are very high my father would have been laid off, because its teenaged kids like my dad who have gotten laid off. If he didnt get laid off, the odds are high he would have had his hours forcibly reduced to 28, 29 hours a week.We need to lift the burdens on small businesses so you have jobs, and we need welfare reform that gets people off of welfare and back to work.GARRETT: Mr. Trump  Mr. Trump.(APPLAUSE)I was with you in Pendleton, South Carolina, earlier this week at the Rodeo Arena. It was a bit chilly there. You promised the crowd, and they rose to their feet, that if Ford or a company like were to move a factory to Mexico, you would try to stop it or threaten them with a 35 percent tax or tariff on every car sold.TRUMP: Or a tax.GARRETT: Right. So my question is, based on your understanding of the presidency, where do you derive that power? Would you need the consent of Congress to go along? And do you see the presidency as a perch from which you can cajole and/or threaten private industry to do something you think is better for the U.S. economy?TRUMP: I would build consensus with Congress, and Congress would agree with me. Ill give you an example, because I dont like the idea of using executive orders like our president. It is a disaster what hes doing. I would build consensus, but consensus means you have to work hard. You have to cajole. You have to get them into the Oval Office and get them all together, and you have to make deals.Let me just tell you, I mentioned before, China  big Chinese company bought the Chicago Exchange. Kerry is moving  and if you saw the people, because they have a video of the announcement that Carrier is moving to Mexico, O.K.?Well, Ill tell you what. I would go right now to Carrier and I would say I am going to work awfully hard. Youre going to make air conditioners now in Mexico. Youre going to get all of these 1,400 people that are being laid off  theyre laid off. They were crying. They were  it was a very sad situation. Youre going to go to Mexico. Youre going to make air conditioners in Mexico, youre going to put them across our border with no tax.Im going to tell them right now, I am going to get consensus from Congress and were going to tax you when those air conditioners come. So stay where you are or build in the United States, because we are killing ourselves with trade pacts that are no good for us and no good for our workers.(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: All right. Mr. Trump, thank you so much. Were going to take a break for a moment. Well be back in a moment with the CBS News Republican debate.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)DICKERSON: Were back now from Greenville, South Carolina, with the candidates for the Republican presidential nomination.Mr. Trump, I have a question for you. Presidents have to, on the one hand, be firm, but also be flexible.You have been flexible and changed your opinion on a number of things, from abortion to Hillary Clinton. But you have said, rightly, that its just like Ronald Reagan, who changed his mind on things.But at the same time, youre criticizing Senator Cruz for what you say is a change on immigration. He disputes that, of course.So, why is your change of opinion make you like Reagan, and when he changes his opinion, its a huge character flaw?(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: John, in life you have flexibility. You do have flexibility. When youre fighting wars, youre going one way, you have a plan. Its a beautiful plan. It cant lose. The enemy makes a change, and all of a sudden you have to change.You have to have flexibility. In Ronald Reagan, though, in terms of what were talking about, was the great example. He was a somewhat liberal Democrat who became a somewhat, pretty strong conservative. He became  most importantly, he became a great president. He made many of the changes that Ive made  I mean, Ive seen as I grew up, Ive seen, and as I get older and wiser, and I feel that I am a conservative.Now, I also feel Im a common-sense conservative, because some of the views I dont agree with. And I think a lot of people agree with me, obviously, based on whats happening.DICKERSON: Which conservative idea dont you agree with?TRUMP: Well, I think these people always hit me with eminent domain, and frankly, Im not in love with eminent domain. But eminent domain is something you need very strongly.When Jeb had said, You used eminent domain privately for a parking lot. It wasnt for a parking lot. The state of New Jersey  too bad Chris Christie is not here, he could tell you  the state of New Jersey went to build a very large tower that was going to employ thousands of people.I mean, it was going to really do a big job in terms of economic development. Now, just so you understand, I got hit very hard. Its private, its private eminent domain. You understand that they took over a stadium in Texas, and they used private eminent domain, but he just found that out after he made the charge.DICKERSON: All right. Governor Bush, I think by they, he is referring to your brother, these on the hook for your brother.TRUMP: Yeah. Well, Jeb wouldnt have known about it.BUSH: So, there  so, there is all sorts of intrigue about where I disagree with my brother, there would be one right there. You should not use eminent domain for private purposes.A baseball stadium or a parking lot for a limo...(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: You shouldnt have used it then, Jeb.DICKERSON: But that was his brother.BUSH: Its very different. Transmission lines, pipe lines, bridges and highways. All of that is proper use of imminent domain. Not to take an elderly womans home to build a parking lot so that high-rollers can come from New York City to build casinos in Atlantic City.STRASSEL: Senator Cruz, you were mentioned in the mix here, your response?CRUZ: You know, flexibility is a good thing, but it shouldnt  you shouldnt be flexible on core principles. I like Donald, he is an amazing entertainer, but his policies for most of his life...TRUMP: Thank you very much, I appreciate it.CRUZ: For most of his life, his policies have been very, very liberal. For most of his life, he has described himself as very pro- choice and as a supporter of partial birth abortion. Right now, today, as a candidate, he supports federal taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood. I disagree with him on that.Thats a matter of principle, and Ill tell you...TRUMP: You probably are worse than Jeb Bush. You are single biggest liar. This guys lied  let me just tell you, this guy lied about Ben Carson when he took votes away from Ben Carson in Iowa, and he just continues. Today, we had robo-calls saying, Donald Trump is not going to run in South Carolina, where Im leading by a lot.Im not going to vote for Ted Cruz. This is the same thing he did to Ben Carson. This guy will say anything, nasty guy. Now I know why he doesnt have one endorsement from any of his colleagues.CRUZ: Don, I need to go on...TRUMP: Hes a nasty guy.CRUZ: I will say, it is fairly remarkable to see Donald defending Ben after he called, pathological, and compared him to a child molester. Both of which were offensive and wrong.But let me say this  you notice Donald didnt disagree with the substance that he supports taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood. And Donald has this weird pattern, when you point to his own record, he screams, Liar, liar, liar. You want to go...TRUMP: Where did I support it? Where did I...CRUZ: You want to go...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Again, where did I support it?CRUZ: If you want to watch the video, go to our website at Tedcruz.org.TRUMP: Hey Ted, where I support it?CRUZ: You can see it out of Donalds own mouth.TRUMP: Where did I support?CRUZ: You supported it when we were battling over defunding Planned Parenthood. You went on...TRUMP: Thats a lot of lies.CRUZ: You said, Planned Parenthood does wonderful things and we should not defund it.TRUMP: It does do wonderful things, but not as it relates to abortion.CRUZ: So Ill tell you what...TRUMP: Excuse me. Excuse me, there are wonderful things having to do with womens health.CRUZ: You see, you and I...TRUMP: But not when it comes to abortion.CRUZ: Don, the reasoned principle matters. The reasoned principle matters, sadly was illustrated by the first questions today. The next president is going to appoint one, two, three, four Supreme Court justices.If Donald Trump is president, he will appoint liberals. If Donald Trump is president, your Second Amendment will gone...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Hold on...CRUZL You know how I know that?DICKERSON: Hold on, gentleman, Im going to turn this car around.TRUMP: Ted Cruz told your brother that he wanted John Roberts to be on the United States Supreme Court. They both pushed him, he twice approved Obamacare.DICKERSON: All right, gentlemen.BUSH: My name was mentioned twice.DICKERSON: Well, hold on. Were going to  gentlemen, were in danger of driving this into the dirt.DICKERSON: Senator Rubio, Id like you to jump in here...BUSH: He called me a liar.DICKERSON: I understand, youre on deck, governor.BUSH: Also, he talked about one of my heroes, Ronald Reagan.Ronald Reagan was a liberal maybe in the 1950s. He was a conservative reformed governor for eight years before he became president, and no one should suggest he made an evolution for political purposes. He was a conservative, and he didnt tear down people like Donald Trump is. He tore down the Berlin Wall.TRUMP: O.K., governor.BUSH: He was a great guy.(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Senator Cruz, 30 seconds on this one.CRUZ: I did not nominate John Roberts. I would not have nominated John Roberts.TRUMP: You pushed him. You pushed him.CRUZ: I supported...TRUMP: You worked with him and you pushed him. Why do you lie?CRUZ: You need to learn to not interrupt people.TRUMP: Why do you lie?CRUZ: Donald, adults learn...TRUMP: You pushed him.CRUZ: Adults learn not to interrupt people.TRUMP: Yeah, yeah, I know, youre an adult.CRUZ: I did not nominate him. I would not have nominated him. I wouldve nominated my former boss Liberman, who was Justice Scalias first law clerk. And you know how I know that Donalds Supreme Court justices will be liberals? Because his entire life, he support liberals from Jimmy Carter, to Hillary Clinton, to John Kerry.In 2004, he contributed to John Kerry. Nobody who cares about judges would contribute to John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid.DICKERSON: Were going to switch...CRUZ: Thats what Donald Trump does.DICKERSON: Were going to switch here to Senator Marco Rubio.Senator Marco Rubio, please weigh in.RUBIO: On anything I want?DICKERSON: I thought you had a point?RUBIO: Well, let me talk about poverty.DICKERSON: I thought you had a point you wanted to make.RUBIO: I do.BUSH: That was me.RUBIO: I had something important.DICKERSON: Youre on deck, sir.RUBIO: The issue of poverty is critical, because for me, poverty is the  is  is free enterprise not reaching people. Today, we have antipoverty programs that dont cure poverty. We dont cure poverty in America. Our antipoverty programs have become, in some instances, a way of life, a lifestyle.Now, we do need antipoverty programs, you cant have free enterprise programs without them, but not as a way of life. And so I have a very specific proposal on this and I dont  in 60 seconds, I cant describe it all, but it basically turns the program over to states. It allows states to design innovative programs that cure poverty, because I think Nikki Haley will do a better job curing poverty than Barack Obama.(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Senator, I wanted to ask you, just going back to immigration, in the last debate, you listed your series of accomplishments in the Senate. One thing you left off was  was immigration reform. Is it the case that in your list of accomplishments you cant mention that?RUBIO: Well, no. Its not the case. It didnt pass, and we havent solved immigration in this country. Its still a problem. It is worse today than it was three years ago, which is worse than it was five years ago. And it has to be confronted and solved.But the only way forward on this issue  you asked a question about flexibility. Let me tell you about that. One of the things that you need in leadership is the ability to understand that to get things done, you must figure out the way to get it done. You will not pass comprehensive immigration reform. People do not trust the federal government.They want to see the law being enforced. They want to see illegal immigration come under control. They want to see that wall. They want to see E-Verify. They want to see all of these things working, and then they will have a conversation with you about what do you do with people that have been here a long time that are otherwise, you know, not criminals. But theyre not going to do it until you first enforce the law.DICKERSON: Dr. Carson, I have...(APPLAUSE)Dr. Carson, I have a question for you. Candidates are...CARSON: Before you ask the question, can I respond to the  you know, they mentioned my name a couple of times.DICKERSON: All right. You have 30 seconds, Doctor.CARSON: All right. Well, first of all, you know, so many people have said to me, You need to scream and jump and down  jump up and down like everybody else. Is that really what you want? What we just saw? I dont think so.And you know, I  when I got into this race, I decided to look under the hood of the engine of what runs Washington, D.C., and my first inclination was to run away, but I didnt do it because Im thinking about our children and the fact that we are the United States of America. And anybody up here is going to be much better than whats going to come on the other side. And what happened tonight with  with Justice Scalia tells you that we cannot afford to lose this election, and we cannot be tearing each other down.(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Dr. Carson, I  let me ask you a different question. When you were  you were the first one, really, to talk about political correctness. Everybody now talks about it, but that was really what sparked your  your rise. Politicians are often accused of glossing over any hard choices people have to make, just always selling happy, nice things. So in the  in the spirit of saying something that might be politically incorrect, tell the voters something that they need to hear but that might be politically incorrect?CARSON: Well, first of all, Im not a politician, so Im never going to become a politician. But heres what  heres what people need to know. People need to know that free college is not  its a non-starter. You know, you have to look at our economic situation. Were on the verge of economic collapse and, you know, were  its not just the $19 trillion, but its also the $200 trillion in unfunded liabilities.What we need to think about is, what does that do to the average person? When we have a debt of that nature, it causes the Fed to change their policy, it causes the central bank to keep the  the rates low, and who does does that affect? Mr. Average, who used to go to the bank every Friday and put part of his check in the bank and watch it grow over three decades and be able to retire with a nice nest egg, thats gone. That part of the American dream is gone.All of these things are disappearing, and Bernie Sanders and people like Hillary Clinton blame it on the rich. They say those evil rich people, if we take their money we can solve the problem. Its not the evil rich people. Its the irresponsible, evil government.(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Governor Kasich. Governor Kasich, youve been described as the Democrats favorite Republican. You talked about in New Hampshire, Democrats would come up to you and say, I hope you win. Why will that help you win a Republican nomination?KASICH: You know, John, I think all people are the same. Look, I did 106 town halls, and Ive been doing them left and right here in South Carolina. The first thing we have to do is grow the economy, and I know the formula because I was chairman in Washington when we balanced the budget and created so many jobs, and the same that weve been able to do in Ohio. You need common-sense regulations so small business can flourish, you need lower taxes both on business and individuals, and you need a fiscal plan to be able to get ourselves in a situation where people can predict a little bit about the future when it comes to the fiscal issues.And when you have that formula, combined with work force thats trained, you can explode the economy and create many jobs. I have done it twice, and I want to go back to Washington and do it again.John, the thing is, is I think that there are people now, these blue-collar Democrats  my dad was a blue-collar Democrat  the Democratic Party has left them. When theyre arguing about being socialists, theyve left  they have lost those blue-collar Democrats.And you know what I think they get out of me  is my sense of what they get out of me, and its embarrassment about campaigns, you brag about yourself.But I think Im a uniter, I think people sense it. I think they know I have the experience, and that Im a man that can give people hope and a sense that they have the opportunity rise. And Ill tell you, I love these blue-collar Democrats, because theyre going to vote for us come next fall, promise you that.(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Mr. Trump, let me ask you a question. Presidents in both parties say that the one thing you need in your administration is somebody who can tell you youre wrong.You dont necessarily seem like somebody who has somebody who tells you youre wrong a lot. Can you tell us of an instance where somebody has said, Donald Trump, youre wrong, and you listened to them?TRUMP: Well, I would say my wife tells me Im wrong all the time. And I listen.(LAUGHTER)DICKERSON: About what?TRUMP: Oh, let me just say  look, I am very open  I hired top people. Ive had great success. I built a great, great company. I dont need to do this. Im self-funding. Im spending a lot of money. Ive spent  like in New Hampshire, I spent $3 million. Jeb bush spent $44 million. He came in five, and I came in No. 1.Thats what the country needs, folks. I spent 3, he spends 42 of their money, of special interest money. And its just  this is not going to make  excuse me. This is not going to make our country great again.This is not what we need in our country. We need people that know what the hell theyre doing. And politicians, theyre all talk, theyre no action. And thats why people are supporting me.I do listen to people. I hire experts. I hire top, top people. And I do listen. And you know what? Sometimes theyre wrong. You have to know what to do, when to do it. But sometimes theyre wrong.DICKERSON: Let me  something, in talking to voters that they wish somebody would tell you to cut it out is the profanity. Whats your reaction to that?(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Well, Ill tell you  over the years, Ive made many speeches. People have asked me, big companies have asked me to make speeches, and friends of mine that run big companies on success.And occasion, in order to sort of really highlight something, Ill use a profanity. One of the profanities that I got credited with using, that I didnt use, was a very bad word, two weeks ago, that I never used.I said, You. And everybody said Oh, he didnt say anything wrong. But you bleeped it, so everyone thinks I said the  I didnt say anything. I never said the word.It is very unfair, that criticism. Now, I will say this, with all of that being said, I have said I will not do it at all, because if I say a word thats a little bit off color, a little bit, it ends up being a headline.I will not do it again. I was a very good student at a great school not using  by the way  not using profanity is very easy.DICKERSON: All right. O.K. Governor Bush, Id like to ask you...BUSH: Yeah, well, I have got to respond to this.DICKERSON: Well, can I  how about you respond, and then you can answer the question Im about to ask you.BUSH: Sounds like a good plan.DICKERSON: Itll be...BUSH: Or you could ask me two questions, so I could get two minutes instead of one.DICKERSON: If we adjudicate this, the night will be over.Governor, in 2012, you said that your father and Ronald Reagan would have a hard time in todays Republican Party, based on their records of trying to find accommodation and finding some degree of common ground.Do you still feel that way?BUSH: I think the dysfunction in Washington is really dangerous, thats what I think. And we need a proven leader that has a record of solving problems, someone who doesnt cut and run; someone who could be a commander in chief to unite our country around common purposes; someone who doesnt disparage people.Someone that doesnt brag, for example, that he has been bankrupt four times and it was great, because he could use the legal system.Someone...TRUMP: Thats not  let me respond. Thats another lie. I never went bankrupt!(CROSSTALK)DICKERSON: Hold on, Mr. Trump.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: No, but its another lie.DICKERSON: Hold on, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: No, but its another lie. This guy doesnt know what hes talking about. Just a lie.BUSH: We need someone with a proven record to be able to forge consensus to solve problems.And right now, both Republicans and Democrats in Washington dont get it. People are struggling  63 percent of Americans cant make a $500 car payment. Most Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. And we need someone has a proven record of growing the economy, reforming the things that are broken.And Im that person.DICKERSON: O.K., Mr. Trump, your response.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Let me just tell you. Jeb goes around saying, just like the biggest business leaders in this country, Ive used the laws of the land to chapter  I bought a company, I threw it immediately into a chapter, I made a great deal. I uses the laws to my benefit, because I run a company.BUSH: Yeah...TRUMP: Excuse me, Jeb!BUSH: Yeah.TRUMP: I never went bankrupt, never.Now  but you dont want to say that. Now, let me just say, Ive used it, just like the biggest leaders in the country. Let me tell you something  Florida. Florida, he put so much debt on Florida. You know, we keep saying hes a wonderful governor, wonderful governor. He put so much debt on Florida, and he increased spending so much that as soon as he got out of office, Florida crashed.I happened to be there. Its my second home. Florida crashed. He didnt do a good job as governor.BUSH: Here we go.TRUMP: And you havent  excuse me, you havent heard that. You listen to the good record in Florida. You take a look at what happened, as soon as that year ended he got out, Florida crashed. Too much debt.He loaded it up with debt, and his spending went through the roof.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: By the way...DICKERSON: The bells are ringing, sir.TRUMP: ... he was not a good governor.BUSH: Heres the record. Heres the record. We led the nation in job growth seven out of eight years. When I left there was $9 billion of reserves, 35 percent of general revenue. No state came close to that.TRUMP: Take a look at your numbers.BUSH: When I  during my time, we were one of the two states to go to AAA bond rating. We didnt go bankrupt like Trump did and call it success when people are laid off, when vendors dont get paid. Thats not success.What we did was create an environment where people had a chance to have income. Personal income during my time went up by 4.4 percent.TRUMP: Florida went down the tubes right after he got out of office.BUSH: The government grew by...TRUMP: Went right down because of what he did to it.BUSH: ... half of that.DICKERSON: All right. Thank you.Senator Rubio, I want to ask you a 30-second question, no president can...RUBIO: Thirty seconds.DICKERSON: No  well, Ill ask the question, you do what you want.RUBIO: I speak fast.(LAUGHTER)DICKERSON: No president can know everything, right? So a smart leader knows how to ask questions. So if you could talk to any previous president, whats the smart question you would ask about that job that you would want to know?RUBIO: Well, I think one of the presidents  well, the president I grew up under was Ronald Reagan. And Reagan had a vision for Americas future. And if you think about what Ronald Reagan inherited, its not unlike what the next president is going to inherit.This is the worst president weve had in 35 years, 35 years back would have made it Jimmy Carter. Thats what Ronald Reagan inherited. And I think the question you would ask is, how did you inspire again the American people to believe in the future?How did you  what did it take to ensure that the American people, despite all of the difficulties of the time  you know, you look back at that time, the American military was in decline. Our standing in the world was in decline. We had hostages being held in Iran. Our economy was in bad shape.The American people were scared about the future. They were scared about what kind of country their children were going to live in and inherit. And yet somehow Ronald Reagan was able to instill in our nation and in our people a sense of optimism.And he turned America around because of that vision and ultimately because of that leadership. I wish Ronald Reagan was still around. This country needs someone just like that.And if our next president is even half the president Ronald Reagan was, America is going to be greater than it has ever been.(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: All right. Thats going to have to be it there, Senator Rubio. We have got to go to a break. We will be right back with the CBS News Republican debate in Greenville, South Carolina.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)DICKERSON: Time now for closing statements. You will each have one minute, and well begin with Governor Kasich.KASICH: Well, I want to thank the people of South Carolina. Youve been fantastic. And look, what I want you to know is Im going to send a lot of power, money and influence back to where we all live. But as Ive traveled around South Carolina, Ive noticed something. You know, its that people have a sense that youre not going to wait on a president. You know, when I was a kid, we didnt wait on presidents to come to that little blue-collar town and fix things.You know, the Lord made all of us special. The Lord wants us to be connected. I believe were part of a very big mosaic. And Ill send the power back. And whoever gets elected president here, hopefully will take care of the issue of jobs and wages and Social Security and the border.But the spirit of the America rests in all of us. Its in our guts. Its taking care of our children. Its taking care of the lady next door who just lost her husband. Its fixing the schools where we live and telling kids to stay off drugs. You see, I think what the Lord wants is for to us engage, and in America, the spirit of America doesnt come from the top down. The spirit of America rests in us. And I want to call on everyone in America to double down and realize that you were made special to heal this country and lift it for everyone.Thank you all very much. And I hope I can have your vote in South Carolina.(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Dr. Carson  Dr. Carson, youre next.CARSON: This is the first generation not expected to do better than their parents. Some people say its the new normal, but theres nothing normal about it in an exceptional American. I, like you, am a member of we, the people, and we know that our country is heading off the cliff.Joseph Stalin said if you want to bring America down you, have to undermine three things: our spiritual life, our patriotism and our morality. We, the people, can stop that decline, starting right here in South Carolina. If all the people who say, I love Ben Carson and his policies, but he cant win, vote for me, not only can we win, but we can turn this thing around.You know, we have this manipulation by the political class and by the media telling us who were supposed to pick and how were supposed to live. We, the people, are the only people who will determine that. And if you elect me as your next president, I promise you that you will get somebody who is accountable to everybody and beholden to no one. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Governor  Governor Bush.BUSH: Thank you all very much. The next president is going to be confronted with an unforeseen challenge. Thats almost certain. It could be a pandemic, a major natural disaster or an attack on our country. The question for South Carolinians and Americans is who do you want to have sitting behind the big desk in the Oval Office? Because thats the question. Its not the things were talking about today. Its the great challenge that may happen. I believe I will have a steady hand as commander in chief and president of the United States. I will unite this country around common purposes because I did it as governor of the state of Florida.When I was governor, we had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms in 16 months. Our state was on its back. We recovered far faster than what people thought because we led.We want to challenge rather than cutting and running. Thats what we need in Washington, D.C. We need someone with a servants heart that has a backbone, that isnt going to focus on polls and focus groups. The focus will be on the American people to keep them safe and secure.I ask for your vote next Saturday.(APPLAUSE)GARRETT: Thank you, governor.STRASSEL: And now, Marco Rubio.RUBIO: Thank you, and thank you for watching tonight.This is a difficult time in our country. Our economys flat, its not creating the jobs it once did, and people struggle living paycheck to paycheck. Our cultures in trouble. Wrong is considered right and right is considered wrong.All the things that once held our families together are now under constant assault. And around the world, Americas reputation is in decline. Our allies dont trust us, our adversaries dont fear us, Iran captures our sailors and parades them before the world on video.These are difficult times, but 2016 can be a turning point. Thats why Im running for president, and thats why Im here today to ask you for your vote. If you elect me president, we are going to re-embrace free enterprise so that everyone can go as far as their talent and their work will take them.We are going to be a country that says that life begins at conception and life is worthy of the protection of our laws. Were going to be a country that says that marriage is between one man and one woman. We are going to be a country that says, The constitution and the rights that it talks about do not come from our president, they come from our creator. We are going to be loyal to our allies like Israel, not enemies like Iran. And we will rebuild the U.S. military so no one will there test it.Vote for me. I will unify this party. I will grow it. We will win this election, and we will make the 21st century a new American century.(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Senator Cruz? Senator Cruz, your closing statement?CRUZ: South Carolina, you have a critical choice to make. Our country literally hangs in the balance.Do you want another Washington deal maker who will do business as usual, cut deals with the Democrats, grow government, grow debt and give up our fundamental liberties? Or do you want a conservative, a proven conservative that will stand and fight with you each and every day?Listen, repealing Obamacare is not going to be easy. Passing a simple flat tax that abolishes the I.R.S. is not going to be easy, but if we stand with the American people, we can do it.And today, we saw just how great the stakes are. Two branches of government hang in the balance. Not just the presidency but the Supreme Court. If we get this wrong, if we nominate the wrong candidates, the Second Amendment, life, marriage, religious liberty  every one of those hangs in the balance.My little girls are here. I dont want to look my daughters in the eyes and say, We lost their liberties. Who do you know will defend the Constitution and Bill of Rights? And as a commander in chief, who do you know will stand up to our enemies as the clam, steady, deliberate, strength to defeat our enemies, to secure our borders and to keep America safe.DICKERSON: Mr. Trump, your closing statements?TRUMP: Thank you.Politicians are all talk, no action. Youve seen where theyve take you to. We are 19 trillion dollars right now. Its going to be increased with that horrible budget from a month ago that was just approved by politicians.We need a change. We need a very big change. Were going to make our country great again.I say this every night, every day, every afternoon, and its so true  we dont win anymore. We dont win with health care, we dont win with ISIS and the military, we dont take care of our vets, we dont care of our borders, we dont win. We are going to start winning again. We are not going to be controlled by people that are special interests and lobbyists that everybody here has contributed to. And you know what, they do exactly what those folks want them to do.We are going to make our country great, and were going to do the right thing. Im working for you. Im not working for anybody else.Thank you very much.STRASSEL: Well be back with a few final thoughts in a moment.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)DICKERSON: So thats nine Republican debates knocked down and at least three to go.END'

aS'Heres how we covered the Republican debate.GREENVILLE, S.C.  The remaining six Republicans met here Saturday evening for another primary debate. The men on the stage represented a newly winnowed Republican field ahead of South Carolinas primary on Feb. 20. Here are the highlights: The first question was about Justice Antonin Scalia, who died hours before the debate. Donald J. Trump was unequivocal: He expects President Obama to nominate a new justice, he said, and its up to Mitch and the entire group (that would be Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader) to delay, delay, delay. Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio struck a more moderate tone, but similarly said that the president should not move forward. Jeb Bush struck a different tone on Justice Scalias death, explicitly saying he believed that Mr. Obama has the right to appoint a justice  Im an Article II guy, he said, citing the executive branch section of the Constitution  but that in return, the president should choose a consensus candidate. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida was asked to point to where he had been tested in a crisis  an area that is perceived as a key weakness. But Mr. Rubio steered his response toward a key strength: foreign policy. He cited his decision not to authorize the presidents request to use force in Syria, saying Mr. Obamas plan would have made the situation worse. Mr. Bush and Mr. Trump had a heated exchange during a discussion of foreign policy. But the tenor was more personal than policy. When Mr. Bush questioned Mr. Trumps foreign policy judgment, the real estate billionaire responded, Jeb is absolutely so wrong. As the crowd booed, Mr. Trump retorted, Thats Jebs special interests and lobbyists talking. Moments later, Mr. Bush mocked Mr. Trump as getting his foreign policy from the shows  and he countered by pointing to the money Mr. Bush poured into New Hampshire, to finish fourth. Mr. Bush got an assist from Mr. Rubio in defending the handling of the Sept. 11 attacks by Mr. Bushs brother, former President George W. Bush. While Mr. Trump, Jeb Bush said, was building a reality TV show, my brother was building a security apparatus to keep us safe. And when Mr. Trump criticized the 43rd president for allowing Sept. 11 to happen on his watch, Mr. Rubio chimed in. I thank God all the time that it was George W. Bush in the White House and not Al Gore, he said. He kept us safe, and I am forever grateful. A section on taxes and entitlements featured less interaction, with the candidates instead defending their plans. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said his business flat tax would allow people to fill out their taxes on a postcard and abolish the IRS. Mr. Rubio touted a child tax credit, so that parents who are working get to keep more of their own money. Mr. Kasich defended the expansion of Medicaid in his state. The only real challenge came from Mr. Bush, who sought to put the Ohio governor on the defensive for expanding a portion of the presidents health care law, which, he said, should be repealed and replaced. The debate grew heated over immigration. Mr. Cruz tied Mr. Rubio to what he called an amnesty plan, and Mr. Rubio retorted by citing some of Mr. Cruzs openness to immigration, like increasing the number of green cards. Mr. Cruz, he said, cant be trusted  he was either lying then or lying now. And Mr. Trump said Mr. Bush, who had once called immigration an act of love, was the weakest person on the issue. By the end, one candidate  Mr. Cruz  had even spoken a few words of Spanish. To taunt Mr. Rubio, of course. Things turned nasty  and slightly out of control  when Mr. Cruz accused Mr. Trump of supporting taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood. You are the single biggest liar, Mr. Trump said. This guy will say anything. Nasty guy. Mr. Trump did say he thought Planned Parenthood did wonderful things for womens health, excepting abortions. But the exchange also featured Mr. Trump shouting, Why do you lie? Why do you lie? And Mr. Cruz chiding him that adults learn not to interrupt.'

aS'Following is a transcript of the Democratic debate in Milwaukee, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.WOODRUFF: Good evening, and thank you. We are happy to welcome you to Milwaukee for this Democratic debate.WOODRUFF: We are especially pleased to thank our partners at Facebook, who have helped us set up a vibrant conversation among voters who are undecided. And tonight youre going to hear some of their questions for the candidates. And you can follow along at home on the PBS NewsHour page on Facebook. We also want to thank our hosts, the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, on whose campus we meet, here in the beautiful Helen Bader Concert Hall.IFILL: We want to also extend our warm thanks to Milwaukee Public Radio and Milwaukee Public Television, as well as all of our friends at the PBS member stations across the country tuning in tonight. This is the sixth time the Democrats have met face to face. Each time, we learn more about them and the presidents they say they want to be. You know youre watching  whether youre a Democrat, a Republican, or neither  because you believe the outcome of the election is important to you. And we believe that, too. With that, lets welcome the candidates to the stage. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Welcome, Senator, great to see you. And former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. (APPLAUSE) Very good to be here with you.CLINTON: Thank you.IFILL: Welcome to you both.WOODRUFF: Now, a word about format. There will be two short breaks, and the rules are simple: 90 seconds for each answer and 30 seconds for the other candidate to respond.IFILL: With Iowa and New Hampshire behind us, we are now broadening the conversation to Americas heartland and beyond, including here in Wisconsin. Now lets turn to the candidates for their opening statements. The order was decided by coin toss. And, Senator Sanders, you go first.SANDERS: Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event. And, PBS, thank you. Nine months ago, our campaign began. And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont. A lot has happened in nine months. And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.SANDERS: And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy. And thats an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers. They are worried to death about the future of their kids. And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent. And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system. They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million. Were spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans. They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all. No criminal records for them. I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics. They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors. Thank you.IFILL: Thank you, Senator Sanders. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Thank you, Senator Sanders. Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Im running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind. I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy. And for good cause. Americans havent had a raise in 15 years. There arent enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people. And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top. We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again. But I want to go further. I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now. African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system. Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future. Guaranteeing that womens work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve. I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential. That will be my mission as president. And I think together we will make progress.WOODRUFF: Thank you both. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Thank you both. And well be right back after a short break to begin questions.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WOODRUFF: And, welcome back to this PBS Newshour debate, Democratic debate, here in Milwaukee. Lets get right to the questions. Senator Sanders, to you first. Coming off the results in Iowa and New Hampshire, there are many voters who are taking a closer look at you, and your ideas, and theyre asking how big a role do you foresee for the federal government? Its already spending 21% of the entire U.S. economy. How much larger would government be in the lives of Americans under a Sanders presidency?SANDERS: Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled. In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going  getting poorer. What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people. Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year. I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free. I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind. Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating. Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.WOODRUFF: But, my question is how big would government be? Would there be any limit on the size of the role of government...SANDERS: ... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth. Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that Ive seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans  lets take healthcare for example. Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare. Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers dont add up, and thats a promise that cannot be kept, and its really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math. This is about peoples lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.SANDERS: Well, let us level with the American people. Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, theyre going to lose their CHIP program. I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people. Were not going to dismantle everything. But, here is the truth. Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America. We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. One out of five Americans cant even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing. Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments. What I said, and let me repeat it, I dont know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle  the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars. In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage. You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare. And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage. (APPLAUSE) And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obamas principal accomplishment  namely the Affordable Care Act  is because I know how hard it was to get that done. We are at 90 percent coverage. We have to get the remaining 10. Ive set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs. And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share. But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work. If its Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system. The Childrens Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program. So if youre having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing. And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers dont add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.IFILL: Final thought, Senator.SANDERS: That is absolutely inaccurate. Look, here is the reality, folks. There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people. There is one major country  the United States  which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people. Please do not tell me that in this country, if  and heres the if  we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.CLINTON: Well, let me just  let me just say, once again... (APPLAUSE) ... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care. I believe we are on the path to doing that. The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again. And we are not England. We are not France. We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers. So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage. We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100. I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Id like to move along. Id like to move along. Secretary Clinton, you might  you also have proposed fairly expansive ideas about government. You may remember this pledge from a State of the Union Address at which I believe you were present, in which these words were said: The era of big government is over. You may remember that. When asked your feelings about the federal government this week, 61 percent of New Hampshire Democrats told exit pollsters that they are angry or at least dissatisfied. Given what you and Senator Sanders are proposing, an expanding government in almost every area of our lives, is it fair for Americans who fear government to fear you?CLINTON: No. But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family? In my case, whether its health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward. Ive tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning. There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government. Im aware of that. It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.CLINTON: So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we cant keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in peoples lives.IFILL: But I havent heard either of you put a price tag on your  you say... (CROSSTALK)CLINTON: I will put a price tag. My price tag is about $100 billion a year. And again, paid for. And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt. I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing. And I think once Im in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that. But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.IFILL: Senator?SANDERS: Well, Secretary Clinton, youre not in the White House yet. And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for. For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling? Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that? Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent? Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent. We need to create jobs. So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax. Yes, Im going to do away with that. We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure. Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession  Great Depression. Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free. We bailed them out. Now it is their time to help the middle class. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans. And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition. We differ, however, on a couple of key points. One of them being that if you dont have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, its hard to get to where we need to go. And Senator Sanderss plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free. I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Next, were going to...SANDERS: A brief response.WOODRUFF: Very brief, thank you.SANDERS: Here is where we are with public education. A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms. Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education. And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade. The world has changed. This is 2016. In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago. So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities. That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Secretary Clinton, your campaign  you and your campaign have made a clear appeal to women voters. You have talked repeatedly about the fact, we know you would be, if elected, the first woman president. But in New Hampshire 55 percent of the women voters supported and voted for Senator Sanders. What are women missing about you?CLINTON: Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me. I believe that its most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society. And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face. So Im going to keep making that case. Im going to keep making sure that everything Ive done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known. But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support. I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me. Thats what Im working towards. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: As you know, just quickly, as you know, your strong supporter, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, said the other day that theres a special place in Hell for women who dont support other women. Do you agree with what she said?CLINTON: Well, look, I think that shes been saying that for as long as Ive known her, which is about 25 years. But it doesnt change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make. Thats what Ive always stood for. And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether were going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why thats at the core of my campaign. I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today weve had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage. So, you know, well take our progress wherever we can find it. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Senator Sanders, youre in the minority, but we still want to hear from you. (LAUGHTER)SANDERS: Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian- Americans. We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class. I am very proud, if my memory is not correct  I think I am  that I have a lifetime  and Ive been in Congress a few years  a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record. I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women. Im very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men. And we will join the rest of the other  the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Senator, do you worry at all that you will be the instrument of thwarting history, as Senator Clinton keeps claiming, that she might be the first woman president?SANDERS: Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, I have said  I have said many times, you know, Im not asking people to support me because Im a woman. Im asking people to support me because I think Im the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief. (APPLAUSE) And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders voting record. And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because Ive been a leader on these issues. I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep womens health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.CLINTON: Im very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on womens issues. Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back womens rights. So Im asking women, Im asking men, to support me because Im ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Final comment.SANDERS: Let me concur with the secretary, no question womens rights are under fierce attack all over this country. And I will tell you something that really galls me. I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy. Just a little bit. All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government. Government is the enemy. Were going to cut Social Security to help you. Were going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible. But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America. If thats not hypocrisy, I dont know what hypocrisy is. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Thank you both.IFILL: We turn now to the first of several questions from our partners at Facebook. They were selected from a curated group of people weve been following of undecided voters. The first comes from Claudia Looze, a 54-year-old woman who works as a program manager at a public affairs cable network in Madison, Wisconsin. And she writes: Wisconsin is number one in African-American male incarceration, according to a University of Wisconsin study. They found that Wisconsins incarceration rate for black men, which is at 13 percent, was nearly double the countrys rate. What can we do across the nation to address this? Senator Sanders.SANDERS: This is one of the great tragedies in our country today. And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug. It has to be dealt with. Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail. That is beyond unspeakable. So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods. The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates. The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana. Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations. The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites. We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system. I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers. What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders. The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration. The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average. And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us. His family certainly believes that. And so do I. So we have work to do. There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen. President Obamas policing commission came out with some. I have fully endorsed those.CLINTON: But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect. And, then we have to go after sentencing, and thats one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesnt happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level. But, I would also add this. There are other racial discrepancies. Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities. So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with. This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea. It takes away discretion from judges. We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies. (APPLAUSE) We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity. And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see. People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up  were shocked that they end up back in jail again. So, we have a lot of work to do. But, here is a pledge Ive made throughout this campaign, and its really not a very radical pledge. When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size. Heres my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country. We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Secretary Clinton, I was talking recently with a 23 year old black woman who voted for President Obama because she said she thought relations between the races would get better under his leadership, and his example. Hardly anyone believes that they have. Why do you think race relations would be better under a Clinton presidency? What would you do that the nations first African American has not been able to?CLINTON: Well, Im just not sure I agree completely with that assessment. I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did. We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone. So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society. I think President Obama has set a great example. I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward. Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next. We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system. We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education. I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the Presidents office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obamas work with young women. But, we cant rest. We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before. So, its going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open. Nobody can deny them. To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out. So, were going to enforce the law, were going to change policing practices, were going to change incarceration practices, but were also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.(APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Senator Sanders? (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt. People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings. Turns out that the African- American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard. As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse. So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration  which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother  clearly, we are looking at institutional racism. We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.WOODRUFF: So race relation was be better under a Sanders presidency than theyve been?SANDERS: Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so theyre not hanging out on street corners. Were going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education. And I think when you give low-income kids  African-American, white, Latino kids  the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail. Theyre going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Let me turn this on its head, because when we talk about race in this country, we always talk about African-Americans, people of color. I want to talk about white people, OK?SANDERS: White people?IFILL: I know. (LAUGHTER) So many people will be surprised to find out that we are sitting in one of the most racially polarized metropolitan areas in the country. By the middle of this century, the nation is going to be majority nonwhite. Our public schools are already there. If working- class, white Americans are about to be outnumbered, are already underemployed in many cases, and one study found they are dying sooner, dont they have a reason to be resentful, Senator  Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Look, I am deeply concerned about whats happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths. People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived. This is a remarkable and horrifying fact. And thats why Ive come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal. You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us? Do people not care about all of our sacrifice? And Im going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country. I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has  the 10-20-30 proposal  to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty. And you know what? If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out. So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans  particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have  you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is. And thats why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Senator  Senator, I want you to respond to that, but I also want you to  am I wrong? Is it even right to be describing this as a matter of race?SANDERS: Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well. So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue. But it is a general economic issue.SANDERS: And heres what the economic issue is. The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be. Why is that? Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues. But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street. Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world. But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits. You once had a pension. Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone. Theyre off to China. Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone. What have you got now? You are working at McDonalds? That is why there is massive despair all over this country. People have worked their entire lives. Theyre making a half, two-thirds what they used to make. Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all. And thats why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down. Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, thats why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Thank you. Senator Sanders, one of the causes of anxiety for working class Americans is connected to immigrants. President Obama, as you know, has issued executive actions to permit some 5 million undocumented immigrants who are living now in the United States to come out of the shadows without fear of deportation to get work permits. Would you go further than that? And if so, how specifically would you do it? Should an undocumented family watching this debate tonight, say, in Nevada, rest easy, not fear of further deportations under a Sanders presidency?SANDERS: The answer is yes. Weve got 11 million undocumented people in this country. I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported. I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported. I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship. I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act. And in fact I would go further. What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up. And let me say this also. Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies. And I would not support those. Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesnt do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: I strongly support the presidents executive actions. I hope the Supreme Court upholds them. I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did. I am against the raids. Im against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up. We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country. Im a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform. Have been ever since I was in the Senate. I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act. I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007. Senator Sanders voted against it at that time. Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade. Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country. And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here. If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country. That was not, as I understand it, the secretarys position. In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it. I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery. Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, theyd be thrown out of this country. So it wasnt just me who opposed it. It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country. It was the AFL-CIO. It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason. But we are where we are right now. And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up. What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.CLINTON: Two quick responses. One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers. Ive also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law. And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedys bill. And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done. And I was proud to stand with him and support it. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Id like...SANDERS: Well, let me just respond. I worked with Ted Kennedy. He was the chairman of my committee. And I loved Ted Kennedy. But on this issue, when you have one of the large Latino organizations in America saying vote no, and you have the AFL-CIO saying vote no, and you have leading progressive Democrats, in fact, voting no, I dont apologize for that vote. But in terms of the children, I dont know to whom youre sending a message. Who are you sending a message to? These are children who are leaving countries and neighborhoods where their lives are at stake. That was the fact. I dont think we use them to send a message. I think we welcome them into this country and do the best we can to help them get their lives together. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well, that just wasnt  that just wasnt the fact, Senator. The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border. So we have a disagreement on this. I think now what Ive called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: If you would allow me now to move on, weve been talking about children. I want to talk about seniors. That takes us to our second Facebook question from Farheen Hakeem, who writes, My father  shes a 40-year-old woman who works for a nonprofit here in Milwaukee. And she writes, My father gets just $16 in food assistance per month as part of Medicaids family community program in Milwaukee County for low-income seniors. How will you as president work to ensure low-income seniors get their basic needs met? Start with you, Senator Sanders.SANDERS: OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation. And by those standards, were not doing particularly well.SANDERS: We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth. And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors  and Ive talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country  who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security. And you know what? You do the arithmetic. You cant get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year. And heres an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference. I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000. (APPLAUSE) And when we  and when we do that, we dont do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security. We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years. Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes. But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they dont have decent nutrition, where they cant heat their homes in the wintertime. That is not what America should be about. If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: I think  I think its fair to say we dont have a disagreement. We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system. Ive said Im looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund. I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially. First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs. I want to take care of women. When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked. And women have been disadvantaged ever since. They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities. And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment. So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program. But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who dont believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.SANDERS: In all due respect... (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question. Are you coming onboard a proposal? And what is that proposal? Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008. You opposed him then. I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do. Were asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity. I hope you will make a decision soon on this.CLINTON: Well, Senator, look, I think were in vigorous agreement here. We both want to get more revenue in. I have yet to see a proposal that youre describing that the  raising the cap would apply to passive income. That has not been...SANDERS: Thats my bill. Check it out.CLINTON: Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that Ive seen. Im interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it. So Im going to come up with the best way forward. Were going to end up in the same place. Were going to get more revenue. Im going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Were going to move on. Secretary Clinton, your campaign has recently ramped up criticism of Senator Sanders for attending Democratic Party fundraisers from which you say he benefited. But nearly half of your financial sector donations appear to come from just two wealthy financiers, George Soros and Donald Sussman, for a total of about $10 million.WOODRUFF: You have said that theres no quid pro quo involved. Is that also true of the donations that wealthy Republicans give to Republican candidates, contributors including the Koch Brothers?CLINTON: I cant speak for the Koch Brothers, youre referring to a Super PAC that we dont coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me. They are the ones who should respond to any questions. Lets talk about our campaigns. Im very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions. So, Im proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters. I think its great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side. Thats the way it should be, and Im going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is. I think that is the real key here. We both have a lot of small donors. I think that sets us apart from a lot of whats happening right now on the Republican side. The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda. It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country. Were going to fight it as hard as we can, and were going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Im asking if Democratic donors are different than Republican donors.SANDERS: What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, thats what were talking about. We have to be honest about it. It is undermining American democracy. When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK? We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC? And, we said no. We dont represent Wall Street, we dont represent the billionaire class, so it ends up Im the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC. But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something. And, it turns out that up until  and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people. Now, Secretary Clintons Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street. Our average contribution is $27 dollars, Im very proud of that. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Senator Sanders, are you saying...CLINTON: We are mixing apples and oranges. My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations. Im very proud. That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country. But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me. Its not my PAC. If you take donations from Wall Street, you cant be independent. I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever. Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street. He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930s. So, lets not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether its Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do whats best for the American people.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: The people arent dumb. Why in Gods name does Wall Street... (APPLAUSE) But lets not  but lets not  lets not insult  lets not insult the intelligence of the American people. People arent dumb. Why in Gods name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions? I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around. (LAUGHTER) Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions? Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs? Why does the fossil fuel industry pay  spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions? Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system? (APPLAUSE) And when we talk about Wall Street, lets talk about Wall Street. I voted for Dodd- Frank, got an important amendment in it. In my view, it doesnt go anywhere near far enough. But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash. No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well, lets just  lets just follow up on this, because, you know, Ive made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk. I think thats a major accomplishment. I agree, however, it doesnt go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason. I go further in the plan that Ive proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face. It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse. It was a big insurance company, AIG. It was Countrywide Mortgage. My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be. And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective. It goes in the right direction. We have Dodd-Frank. We can use it to break up the banks, if thats appropriate. But lets not kid ourselves. As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon. I want to get ahead of those, and thats why Ive proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these... (CROSSTALK) (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: We have to go to a break. We...SANDERS: Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here. When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up. I think he would have been right. I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation. I think that would have been right, as well. Thats my view. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: All right. Thank you both. It is time for a break. And when we come back, were going to turn to some new topics, including how these candidates will keep America safe.IFILL: Theres a lot more to come in just a few minutes. Stay with us for more of the PBS NewsHour Democratic Debate.(BREAK)WOODRUFF: Welcome back to the Democratic presidential debate. Before we return to our questions, we have a follow-up question from our Facebook group. And it is to Senator Sanders. Senator, it comes from Bill Corfield. He is a 55-year-old musician from Troy, Ohio. And he asks: Are there any areas of government you would like to reduce?SANDERS: Hey, Im in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesnt think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken. I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.IFILL: How about you, Senator Clinton  Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Absolutely. And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve. There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities. I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that were taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we dont need anymore. And thats what I intend to do.SANDERS: If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited. And I have the feeling youre going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: We spent the first part of this debate talking about domestic insecurity. The second part, we want to talk about our foreign policy insecurities. And we want to start with a question for you, Secretary Clinton, about Americas role in the world. Americans are becoming increasingly worried that attacks abroad are coming home, that they already are, in fact, here. According to exit polls from last week, from earlier this week, more than two- thirds of Democrats in New Hampshire are concerned about sending their children to fight in wars they cant win. They fret that the next attack is just around the corner and we are not ready. Are we?CLINTON: Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but its a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be. We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we havent done enough. So we have to go after this both abroad and at home. We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS  thats not the only one, but lets focus on that for a minute. We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS. That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in. We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi. We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so. And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters. And we have to take on ISIS online. They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence. Here at home, weve got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement. We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where its needed. But the final thing I want to say about this is the following. You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it. And we need to do that throughout the country. But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense. They are more likely to know whats happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society. So when somebody like Donald Trump and others... (APPLAUSE) ... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home. Its not only offensive; its dangerous. And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations. I know how to do that. I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program. (APPLAUSE) And you dont go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion. So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.IFILL: Senator Sanders...SANDERS: Let me just say this. What a president of the United States has got to do  and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility  is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect... ... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe. That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values. That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity. I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didnt believe them. And if you go to my Web site,berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred. Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change. Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world. And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator. We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to. We got rid of Gadhafi. But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, its to understand what happens the day after. And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi. But what happened is a political vacuum developed. ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold. But this is nothing new. This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments. Mossadegh back in 1953. Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran. He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British. And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator. The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today. Unintended consequences. So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences. I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: If I could just respond. Two points. One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Husseins regime. He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on. I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016. Its very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in. When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief. And its important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them. As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq. And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state. I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs. Secretary of state for four years. Youve got a bit of experience, I would imagine. But judgment matters as well. Judgment matters as well. And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq. I lead the opposition against it. She voted for it. But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent. Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.SANDERS: That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.CLINTON: You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on. And, look, I think its important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden. I looked at the evidence. I looked at the intelligence. I got the briefings. I recommended that the president go forward. It was a hard choice. Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that. And at the end of the day, it was the presidents decision. So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision. Im proud that I gave him that advice. And Im very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Judy, one area very briefly...WOODRUFF: Just a final word.SANDERS: Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate  and I believe in her book  very good book, by the way  in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger. Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country. (APPLAUSE) I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend. I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger. And in fact, Kissingers actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world. So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, I know journalists have asked who you do listen to on foreign policy, and we have yet to know who that is.SANDERS: Well, it aint Henry Kissinger. Thats for sure.CLINTON: Thats fine. Thats fine. (LAUGHTER) You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas. I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America. (APPLAUSE) So if we want to pick and choose  and I certainly do  people I listen to, people I dont listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because its a big, complicated world out there.SANDERS: It is.CLINTON: And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: I find  I mean, its just a very different, you know, historical perspective here. Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory. Not everybody remembers that. You do. I do. The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. Thats what he talked about, the great threat of China. And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, youre right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China. The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now hes urging companies to shut down and move to China. Not my kind of guy. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Senator, let me  let me move on to another country with which the U.S. has a complicated relationship, Senator Sanders, and thats Russia. On the one hand, were aware that Russia is a country that the United States needs to cooperate with.WOODRUFF: Just tonight, Secretary of State John Kerry has announced what appears to be an agreement with the Russians to lead  that could lead toward a ceasefire in Syria, would be the first cessation of conflict in that country, in that civil war in five years, but it comes at a very high price, because not only have all  have we seen the deaths, the removal of so many people, millions of people, we now see the Russians in the last few weeks have bombed in a way that benefits President Assad, has not gone after ISIS. So my question to you is, when it comes to dealing with Russia, are you prepared  how hard are you prepared to be? Are you prepared to institute further economic sanctions? Would you be prepared to move militarily if Russia moves on Eastern Europe? It seems to me that Russia recently has gotten the better of the United States.SANDERS: Well, this is what I would say. It is a complicated relationship. I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement. As youve indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed  men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country  their own country - - it is unspeakable. It is a real horror. Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia. But lets be clear: Russias aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO  correctly, I believe  are saying, you know what, were going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action. I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and hes trying to rally his people in support of him. But bottom line is: The president is right. We have to put more money. We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.SANDERS: Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made. The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria. The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to. You know, the Russians wanted to buy time. Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate whats left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire? So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease- fire up as quickly as possible. But I would add this. You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution. At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together. This is incredibly complicated, because weve got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia. We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view. This is one of the areas Ive disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake. Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me. Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter. So lets support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but lets hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy whats left of the opposition. And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups. So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like. So weve got some real work to do, and lets try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Let me just  just say this. For a start, the secretary and I disagree  and I think the president does not agree with her  in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria. I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago. I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement. Lets hope that it holds.SANDERS: But furthermore, what we have got to do, Im sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow. But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba. And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well. But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve. And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations. Thats how you make peace in the world. You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well, I respectfully disagree. I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program. That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement. I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran. Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism. Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos. Yes, theyve got to get out of Syria. Theyve got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas. They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel. We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: We have a lot of work to do. We have a lot of work to do. But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies. I have no illusion. Of course you are right. Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas. Everybody knows that. But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality. (CROSSTALK)CLINTON: ... Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said. The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions? I said no. And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions. That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: No, I think the idea was that president  then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents. Its easier to talk to your friends. Its harder to talk to your enemies. I think we should do both. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Let me move on. You have both mentioned the humanitarian tragedies which have been an outgrowth in part of what has happened in Syria and in Libya. More than a million refugees entered Europe in 2015. Another 76,000 just last month, that is about 2,000 arrivals every day. Nearly 400 people have been lost at sea so far this year, crossing the Mediterranean. And there are reports that 10,000 children are missing. If we are leaders in this world, where should the U.S. be on this? What should the United States be doing, Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that theyre going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union. And its especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this. With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part. And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U. in particular.CLINTON: This is a humanitarian catastrophe. There is no other description of it. So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe. We have to stand with them. We have to provide financial support to them. We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on. And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.SANDERS: A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation. And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria. And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes. And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people. It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, weve got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all. That is not what America is supposed to be about. So I believe that working with Europe  and, by the way, you know, weve got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world. You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia. They have a responsibility, as well. But I think this is a worldwide  that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis were seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: And we have a final question from our Facebook family. And it goes to Senator Sanders. It comes from Robert Andrews. Hes a 40-year-old stay-at-home dad in Dover, Massachusetts. He says, The world has seen many great leaders in the course of human history. Can you name two leaders  one American and one foreign  who would influence your foreign policy decisions? And why do you see them as  why are they influential?SANDERS: You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair. And he stood before the American people and he said, The only thing we have to fear is fear itself, a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression. And then what he did is redefine the role of government. You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit. So what if mass unemployment exists? So what if children are going hungry? Thats not the role of the government. And when FDR said, Yeah, it is, that were going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish. And kind of  thats what I see our campaign is about right now. In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people dont give up on the political process. dont listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us. If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free. We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality. In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchills politics were not my politics. He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects. But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory. Those are two leaders that I admire very much. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said. And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world. I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.CLINTON: But I want to  I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test. And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama. In the past he has called him weak. He has called him a disappointment. He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers remorse when it comes to President Obamas leadership and legacy. And I just couldnt agree  disagree more with those kinds of comments. You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I dont think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president... (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: ... who got us out of that... (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: ... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future. And it is a  the kind of criticism that weve heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans. I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.SANDERS: That is... (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Madam Secretary, that is a low blow. I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years. When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month. We had a $1.4 trillion deficit. And the worlds financial system is on the verge of collapse. As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: But you know what? Last I heard we lived in a democratic society. Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job. So I have voiced criticisms. Youre right. Maybe you havent. I have. But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said? The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process. Thats what I said. That is what I believe. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: President Obama and I are friends. As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator. I have worked for his re- election. His first election and his re-election. But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president. I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue. Do senators have the right to disagree with the president? Have you ever disagreed with a president? I suspect you may have. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I dont agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re- election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements. As a senator, yes, I was a senator. I understand we can disagree on the path forward. But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.IFILL: Senator, if you would like respond to  you may respond to that but it is time for closing statements and you can use your time for closing statements to do that.SANDERS: Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama. I was not that candidate. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: All right, look, this has been a great debate. A lot of interesting issues have come together. Let me conclude by just saying this. There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone. This campaign is not just about electing a president. What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they dont think anybody hears their pains or their concerns. Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, its like going to the moon. It aint going to happen. Low income people who are not involved in the political process.SANDERS: What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power. Thank you all very much. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: You know, we  we agree that weve got to get unaccountable money out of politics. We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again. But heres the point I want to make tonight. I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country. I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether its poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether its the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, thats what I want to take on. And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: Weve got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before... (APPLAUSE) ... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues. Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence? Youre right. But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint. We would still have racism holding people back. We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay. We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday. And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions. So Im going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I dont think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Thank you. Thank you Senator Clinton. Thank you, Senator Sanders. We also want to thank our partners at Facebook and our hosts here at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: And we want to thank our audience, our quiet audience here in Helen Bader Concert Hall, and to all of you watching at home. Thank you all. Stay tuned for analysis of the debate and the overall race for the Democratic nomination. Thats coming up next here on PBS stations and online atPBS.org/NewsHour.IFILL: Im going to remain here in Milwaukee tomorrow evening for a special edition of Washington Week here on PBS.WOODRUFF: And Im going to be returning to Washington. I hope youll join us for the PBS NewsHour tomorrow and every night. Thats it from all of us here in Milwaukee. We thank you.IFILL: Good night. (APPLAUSE)'

aS'Following is a transcript of the Democratic debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.TODD: Good evening, and welcome to the MSNBC Democratic candidates debate.MADDOW: We are super excited to be here at the University of New Hampshire. Tonight, this is the first time that Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have squared off exactly like this. Face-to-face, just one-on-one, just the two of them.TODD: And neither party has seen this yet. These candidates are both running for the Democratic nomination, but they are very different from each other when it comes to what matters most and how they would go about the job of being president. Our job tonight is to draw out those differences so you, the voters, can understand them and be fully informed.MADDOW: And we do hope that the candidates will take this opportunity to show us the distinctions  show us the differences between them. Thats the whole reason that were here tonight.Were not here for talking points. Were to learn about the difference between the candidates. And with that, lets get going. Please join us in welcoming Secretary Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders.(APPLAUSE)TODD: First, I want to say a special thanks to the New Hampshire union leader for helping make this debate possible, and the readers, who helped provide some of the questions and topics that well be addressing tonight.The rules tonight, by the way, are simple: 90 seconds for answers, 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals.MADDOW: And with that, thats it. Were going to begin with 60- second opening statements from each of the candidates. And as agreed to in advance by the two campaigns, were going to begin tonight with Senator Sanders.SANDERS: Rachel, thank you very much.Millions of Americans are giving up on the political process. And theyre giving up on the political process because they understand the economy is rigged.They are working longer hours for low wages. Theyre worried about the future of their kids, and yet almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent. Not what America is supposed to be about. Not the fairness that we grew up believing that America was about. And then sustaining that rigged economy is a corrupt campaign finance system undermining American democracy, where billionaire, Wall Street, corporate America can contribute unlimited sums of money into super PACs and into candidates.Our job, together, is to end a rigged economy, create an economy that works for all, and absolutely overturn Citizens United. One person, one vote. Thats what American democracy is about.TODD: Thank you, Senator. Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Well, Im happy to be here in New Hampshire for this debate, as we move toward the primary on Tuesday.I believe that America has the opportunity to once again live by our values, live up to our values in the 21st century, but I think that America can only do that if Americans can succeed. And there are lots of reasons why Americans today are feeling left out and left behind. CLINTON: Yes, of course, the economy has not been working for most Americans. Yes, of course, we have special interests that are unfortunately doing too much to rig the game.But theres also the continuing challenges of racism, of sexism, of discrimination against the LGBT community, of the way that we treat people as opposed to how we want to be treated.I believe that we can get back on the right track. I want to imagine a country where peoples wages reflect their hard work, where we have healthcare for everyone, and where every child gets to live up to his or her potential.Im fighting for people who cannot wait for those changes, and Im not making promises that I cannot keep.TODD: All right.Lets get started.Secretary Clinton, last night you cited the Concord Monitor when you said of Senator Sanders that, quote, Its very hard to see how any of his proposals could ever be achievable. So please tell us why you think if hes elected president on a platform of promising things like free public college and universal healthcare, that he cannot achieve those things.CLINTON: Well, let me start by saying that Senator Sanders and I share some very big progressive goals. Ive been fighting for universal healthcare for many years, and were now on the path to achieving it. I dont want us to start over again. I think that would be a great mistake, to once again plunge our country into a contentious debate about whether we should have and what kind of system we should have for healthcare.I want to build on the progress weve made; got from 90 percent coverage to 100 percent coverage. And I dont want to rip away the security that people finally have; 18 million people now have healthcare; preexisting conditions are no longer a bar. So we have a difference.I also believe in affordable college, but I dont believe in free college, because every expert that I have talked to says, look, how will you ever control the costs. What I want to do is make sure middle class kids, not Donald Trumps kids, get to be able to afford college. I want to get the economy going again. Its not just enough about what were against, as important as that is. I have a plan to create new jobs, manufacturing, infrastructure, clean energy jobs that will make us the 21st century clean energy super power. I also want to make sure small businesses can start and grow again.And of course, I believe in raising the minimum wage and equal pay for work. But the numbers just dont add up, from what Senator Sanders has been proposing. Thats why all of the independent experts, all of the editorial boards that have vetted both of us have concluded that it is just not achievable.Lets go down a path where we can actually tell people what we will do. A progressive is someone who makes progress. Thats what I intend to do.TODD: Thank you, Secretary.Senator Sanders, so just explain how you spent nearly two decades in Congress and havent gotten any of these things passed. Why do you think as president youll be able to achieve big, big new programs like this?SANDERS: Well, I havent quite run for president before.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)Lets deal with some of the comments that Secretary Clinton made. And by the way, you know, sometimes theres a lot of drama here. I have known Secretary Clinton for 25 years and respect her very much.Here is the issue. Every major country on earth, whether its the U.K., whether its France, whether its Canada, has managed to provide healthcare to all people as a right and they are spending significantly less per capita on health care than we are. So I do not accept the belief that the United States of America cant do that.I do not accept the belief that the United States of America and our government cant stand up to the ripoffs of the pharmaceutical industry which charge us by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.Number two, in the economy today, everybody understands that we need a well educated workforce. This is 2016. When we talk about public education, it can no longer be K through 12th grade. I do believe that public colleges and universities should be tuition free. Well, how do we pay for that? Its an expensive proposition.I do believe that we should substantially lower student debt in this country, which is crushing millions of people. We pay for it, in my view, by a tax on Wall Street speculation. The middle class bailed out Wall Street in their time of need. Now, it is Wall Streets time to help the middle class.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: If I could just follow up on that.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: There is no disagreement between us on universal coverage for health care, the disagreement is where do we start from and where do we end up.The Republicans want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, I want to improve it. I want to build on it, get the costs down, get prescription drug costs down. Senator Sanders wants us to start all over again. This was a major achievement of President Obama, of our country. It is helping people right now.I am not going to wait and have us plunge back into a contentious national debate that has very little chance of succeeding. Lets make the Affordable Care Act work for everybody.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Let me...TODD: Go.SANDERS: ... this is a good discussion here.TODD: Yes, go ahead.SANDERS: And let me just say this. As Secretary Clinton may know, I am on the Health Education Labor Committee. That committee wrote the Affordable Care Act. The idea I would dismantle health care in America while were waiting to pass a Medicare for all is just not accurate. The Affordable Care Act has clearly, as Secretary Clinton made the point, done a lot of good things, but, what it has not done is dealt with the fact we have 29 million people today who have zero health insurance, we have even more who are underinsured with large deductibles and copayments and prescription drug prices are off the wall.So I do believe that in the future, not by dismantling what we have here  I helped write that bill  but by moving forward, rallying the American people, I do believe we should have health care for all.(APPLAUSE)TODD: All right, thank you both. Rachel. MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders is campaigning against you now, at this point in the campaign, basically arguing that you are not progressive enough to be the Democratic nominee. He has said that if you voted for the Iraq war, if you are in favor of the death penalty, if you wobbled on things like the Keystone Pipeline or TPP, if you said single payer health care could never happen, then youre too far to the right of the Democratic Party to be the partys standard bearer.Given those policy positions, why should liberal Democrats support you and not Senator Sanders?CLINTON: Well because I am a progressive who gets things done. And the root of that word, progressive, is progress. But Ive heard Senator Sanders comments, and its really caused me to wonder whos left in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. Under his definition, President Obama is not progressive because he took donations from Wall Street; Vice President Biden is not progressive because she supported Keystone; Senator Shaheen is not progressive because she supports the trade pact. Even the late, great Senator Paul Wellstone would not fit this definition because he voted for DOMA.You know, we have differences and, honestly, I think we should be talk about what we want to do for the country. But if were going to get into labels, I dont think it was particularly progressive to vote against the Brady Bill five times.(APPLAUSE)I dont think it was progressive to vote to give gun makers and sellers immunity. I dont think it was progressive to vote against Ted Kennedys immigration reform. So we could go back and forth like this, but the fact is most people watching tonight want to know what weve done and what we will do. Thats why I am laying out a specific agenda that will make more progress, get more jobs with rising incomes, get us to universal health care coverage, get us to universal pre-k, paid family leave and the other elements of what I think will build a strong economy, that will ensure Americans keep making progress. Thats what Im offering and thats what I will do as president.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders, have you established a list of what it means to be a progressive that is unrealistic?SANDERS: No, not at all. Heres the reality of American economic life today. The reality is that we have one of lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth because so many people have given up on the political process. The reality is that there has been trillions of dollars of wealth going from the middle class in the last 30 years to the top 1/10th of 1 percent.The reality is we that have a corrupt campaign finance system which separates the American peoples needs and desires from what Congress is doing. So to my mind, what we have got to do is wage a political revolution where millions of people have given up on the political process, stand up and fight back, demand the government that represents us and not just a handful of campaign contribution  contributors. SANDERS: Now all of the ideas that Im talking about, they are not radical ideas. Making public colleges and universities tuition free, that exists in countries all over the world, used to exist in the United States. Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and creating 13 million jobs by doing away with tax loopholes that large corporations now enjoy by putting their money into the Cayman Islands and other tax havens. That is not a radical idea.What we need to do is to stand up to the big money interests, and the campaign contributors. When we do that, we can, in fact, transform America.MADDOW: Thank you Senator.(APPLAUSE)TODD: Id like to follow up on a comment that Secretary Clinton said, Senator. President Obama has not called for abolishing the death penalty. President Obama is for the big Asian trade deal known as TPP, and just yesterday you said you cant be both a moderate or a progressive, but you cant be both. Is President Obama, in your judgment, based on these policies positions, a progressive?SANDERS: Let me just pick up on this point. This whole discussion began because I commented, not making overall evaluation about the Secretary. She was in Ohio, I think, in September or November and she got up and said something like, I have been  Im paraphrasing, I have been criticized because people think Im a moderate. Well, I am a moderate.Thats where this came from. It wasnt me paraphrasing her. It is what she said, and all that I said was theres nothing wrong with being a moderate. But, you cant be a moderate, you cant a progressive.In terms of President Obama, I think if we remember where this country was seven years ago, 800,000 jobs being lost every month, $1.4 trillion dollar deficit. The worlds financial system on the verge of collapse. I think that President Obama, Vice President Biden, and the Democratic leadership in the House and the Senate have done a fantastic job. We are in much better shape than we were seven years ago, although my Republican colleagues seem to have forgotten where we were seven years ago. Thats the fact, but, we still have a very long way to go.Do I think President Obama is a progressive? Yes, I do. I disagree with him on a number of issues including the trade agreement. But, yes, I think he has done an excellent job.CLINTON: Well, Chuck...TODD: ... (inaudible) Clinton, go ahead...CLINTON: ... If I could, you know, in the very first debate I was asked am I a moderate or a progressive and I said Im a progressive who likes to get things done. Cherry picking a quote here or there doesnt change my record of having fought for racial justice, having fought for kids rights, having fought the kind of inequities that fueled my interest in service in the first place going back to my days in the Childrens Defense Fund.It certainly didnt stop me from taking on the drug companies and the insurance companies. Before it was called Hillarycare  I mean, before it was called ObamaCare it was called Hillarycare because we took them on, and we werent successful, but we kept fighting and we got the childrens health insurance program. Every step along the way I have stood up, and fought, and have the scars to prove it.So, again...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: ... I think its important that, look, I understand Senator Sanders really trying to distinguish himself. I understand that, thats what you do in campaigns, but at the same time lets not be  in, I think an unfair way, making an accusation, or making an attack about where I stand and about where Ive always stood.It is fair to say, Senator, that in your definition, as you being the self-proclaimed gatekeeper for progressivism, I dont know anyone else who fits that definition, but I know a lot of really hard fighting progressives in the Democratic party who have stood up time, and time again against special interests, against the powerful on behalf of those who are left behind and left out.And, thats what we ought to be celebrating. Lets talk about what we would do as President, and Commander in Chief to make sure the progress continues into the future.(APPLAUSE)TODD: (inaudible) 30 seconds, and then well move.SANDERS: Thats right, I mean, instead of arguing about definitions, lets talk about...CLINTON: ... Well, you began it yesterday with your comments...SANDERS: ... What we should do, and one of the things we should do is not only talk the talk, but walk the walk. I am very proud to be the only candidate up here who does not have a Super PAC, whos not raising huge sums of money from Wall Street...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: ... And special interests. I am enormously proud. Never believed it would happen that we have raised 3.5 million individual contributions, averaging $27 dollars a piece. That is what the political revolution means.(APPLAUSE)TODD: Thank you.MADDOW: Senator Sanders, as a Vermonter, you have almost a home state advantage here in New Hampshire. But back home across the border, you also have a long history of running against Democrats as a third-party candidate, for governor, Senate, for Congress.In 1988 your candidacy as a third-party candidate arguably cost the Democrats a congressional seat and sent a Republican instead.How can you lead the Democratic Party nationally when you have not been a member of the Democratic Party until very recently?SANDERS: Well, Rachel, actually, that wasnt accurate. In 1988 the Republican did win, I believe, by 3 points. I came in second. It was 34-31, I think, 19 for the Democrat. In that race the Democrat was the spoiler, not me. And it is true...(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: It is true, its not to be denied, I am the longest- serving independent in the history of the United States Congress. People of Vermont sent me to Washington as an independent. That is true.But on the other hand, I have  when I was in the House for 16 years, I caucused with the Democrats. In the Senate for nine years caucused with the Democrats, of course. And I was elected by the Democrats to be chair of the Veterans Committee three years ago, which Im very proud of. And now am the rankings member on the Budget Committee, leader of the Democrats in opposition to the majority Republicans.I am running for president as a Democrat. And if elected, not only do I hope to bring forth a major change in national priorities, but let me be frank, I do want to see major changes in the Democratic Party.I want to see working people and young people come into the party in a way that doesnt exist now. And you know what, I want a 50-state strategy so the Democratic Party is not just the party of 25 states.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: You know, the person who first put out the idea of a 50-state party strategy is former Governor Howard Dean, who is with us tonight.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: And Im very proud and grateful to have the support of so many elected Vermonters and former officials. Two former governors, the current governor, the current other senator. I really appreciate that.And I think its because theyve worked with me, theyve seen what I do. They know what kind of a colleague I am. They want me as their partner in the White House. And thats exactly what I will do.Well get things done together. Democrats, Republicans, independents, were going to make progress together when Im president.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: So, Senator, to that point, Secretary Clinton is raising the issue of endorsements by your home state Democrats. Shes implying that that says something about the people who know you best.SANDERS: Well, I dont see it quite like that.MADDOW: How do you see it?SANDERS: I am  will absolutely admit that Secretary Clinton has the support of far more governors, mayors, members of the House. She has the entire establishment or almost the entire establishment behind her. Thats a fact. I dont deny it.But I am pretty proud that we have over a million people who have contributed to our campaign averaging 27 bucks apiece. That we have had meetings where 25,000-30,000 people have come out. That our campaign is a campaign of the people, by the people, and for the people.So, Rachel, yes, Secretary Clinton does represent the establishment. I represent, I hope, ordinary Americans, and by the way, who are not all that enamored with the establishment, but I am very proud to have people like Keith Ellison and Raul Grijalva in the House, the co-chairmen of the House Progressive Caucus.MADDOW: Secretary.CLINTON: Well, look, Ive got to just jump in here because, honestly, Senator Sanders is the only person who I think would characterize me, a woman running to be the first woman president, as exemplifying the establishment. And Ive got to tell you that it is... (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: It is really quite amusing to me.People support me because they know me. They know my lifes work. They have worked with me and many have also worked with Senator Sanders. And at the end of the day they endorse me because they know I can get things done.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: I am not going to make promises I cant keep. I am not going to talk about big ideas like single-payer and then not level with people about how much it will cost.CLINTON: A respected health economist said that these plans would cost a trillion dollars more a year.Im not going to tell people that I will raise your incomes and not your taxes, and not mean it, because I dont want to see the kind of struggle that the middle class is going through exemplified by these promises that would raise taxes and make it much more difficult for many, many Americans to get ahead and stay ahead. That is not my agenda.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders, youll have 30 seconds to respond to that.SANDERS: What being part of the establishment is, is, in the last quarter, having a super PAC that raised $15 million from Wall Street, that throughout ones life raised a whole lot of money from the drug companies and other special interests.To my mind, if we do not get a handle on money in politics and the degree to which big money controls the political process in this country, nobody is going to bring about the changes that is needed in this country for the middle class and working families.CLINTON: Yeah, but I  I think its fair to really ask whats behind that comment. You know, Senator Sanders has said he wants to run a positive campaign. Ive tried to keep my disagreements over issues, as it should be.But time and time again, by innuendo, by insinuation, there is this attack that he is putting forth, which really comes down to  you know, anybody who ever took donations or speaking fees from any interest group has to be bought.And I just absolutely reject that, Senator. And I really dont think these kinds of attacks by insinuation are worthy of you. And enough is enough. If youve got something to say, say it directly.But you will not find that I ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation that I ever received.SANDERS: What...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: And I have stood up and I have represented my constituents to the best of my abilities, and Im very proud of that.SANDERS: ... you know...CLINTON: So I think its time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out...SANDERS: (inaudible).(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: ... in recent weeks, and lets talk...(BOOING)... lets talk about about the issues. Lets talk about the issues that divide us.SANDERS: Lets talk about  OK, lets talk...CLINTON: And lets  lets...SANDERS: ... let us talk about issues.CLINTON: ... we both agree with campaign finance reform.SANDERS: Lets talk about issues.CLINTON: I  I worked hard for McCain-Feingold.SANDERS: Lets...CLINTON: I want to reverse Citizens United.SANDERS: ... lets  lets  lets talk about issues.CLINTON: And so  lets talk about issues.SANDERS: Lets talk  lets talk about issues, all right? Lets talk about why, in the 1990s, Wall Street got deregulated. Did it have anything to do with the fact that Wall Street provided  spent billions of dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions?Well, some people might think, yeah, that had some influence.(LAUGHTER)Lets ask why it is that we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, and your medicine can be doubled tomorrow, and theres nothing that the government can do to stop it.You think it has anything to do with the huge amounts of campaign contributions and lobbying from the fossil fuel industry? Lets talk about climate change.Do you think theres a reason why not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real, and that we need to transform our energy system? Do you think it has anything to do with the Koch brothers and ExxonMobil pouring huge amounts of money into the political system?That is what goes on in America. I am not  I like...(APPLAUSE)... there is a reason. You know, there is a reason why these people are putting huge amounts of money into our political system. And in my view, it is undermining American democracy and it is allowing Congress to represent wealthy campaign contributors and not the working families of this country.CLINTON: Well, you know, Senator, I dont think  I dont...(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)TODD: ... Secretary, were gonna...CLINTON: ... I dont think you could find any person in political life today who has been subjected to more attacks and had more money spent against her by special interests, among whom you have named a few, than I.And Im proud of that. You know, when I took on the drug companies and the insurance companies for universal health care coverage, they went after me with a vengeance. CLINTON: Today, youve got hedge fund billionaires aligned with Karl Rove, running ads against me to try to get Democrats to vote for you. I know this game. Im going to stop this game.But while were talking about votes, youre the one who voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives in 2000, which contributed to the over-leveraging of Lehman Brothers, which was one of the culprits that brought down the economy.So I dont know  Im not impugning your motive because you voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives. People make mistakes and Im certainly not saying you did it for any kind of financial advantage. What weve got to do as Democrats  what weve got to do as Democrats is to be united to actually solve these problems. And what I believe is that I have a better track record and a better opportunity to actually get that job done.Thats what this election should be about.(APPLAUSE)TODD: Thirty seconds.(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: I think as Secretary Clinton knows, there is nobody who fought harder. I was on the House Financial Committee at that time. I heard the arguments coming from Democrats and Republicans  Robert Rubin, Alan Greenspan  about great an idea it would be if we did away with Glass-Steagall and if we allowed investor banks and commercial banks and big insurance companies to merge.Go to YouTube today. Look up Greenspan-Sanders. Listen to what I told them then. I helped lead the effort against deregulation. Unfortunately, we lost that. The result is  was the worst financial disaster since the Great Depression.TODD: Thank you both.MADDOW: Senator Sanders, Secretary Clinton, obviously weve touched a nerve. Were going to be back with more on this subject, and much more, right after this. Stay with us.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)TODD: All right, welcome back. Lets get right to it.Senator Sanders, you were talking about all of your campaign contributions and campaign finance reform. You rail against big money in politics. But do you realize there is one public financing system that we do have in place, and it is  it is in place to run for president. Why arent you walking the walk on that?Why arent you participating in the presidential public financing system which is designed to essentially keep big money out of presidential politics?SANDERS: Chuck, actually we looked at it, but it turns out to be a disaster. The way it is structured right now, if you make it all the way to California, you could do pretty well. But in terms of the early states  Iowa, New Hampshire, the other states  it just doesnt work.Your point is well taken. I believe in public funding of elections, absolutely. But this system is  I dont know if the secretary would agree  is currently very antiquated and no longer applies to modern day politics.TODD: Well, going on that then, why criticize her on Super PACs, and you got  and all this when it is  you know, thats the system? I mean, you could be participating in a publicly-financing  public financing system...SANDERS: But if the...TODD: ... and being able to set  being able to set an example.SANDERS:  but Chuck, it is a public financing system that everybody knows is antiquated. It no longer works. Nobody can become president based on that system. So whats the alternative? There are two alternatives. And, you know, we looked at it. Well, should we do a Super PAC, but I concluded, honestly, I dont represent Corporate America or billionaires, I didnt want it.So the other alternative was to ask working families and the middle class to help out in a transformational campaign. And you know what? We got 3.5 million individual contributions, $27 a piece. I think thats pretty good.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, on the issue of Wall Street...CLINTON: On the issue of Wall Street.MADDOW: ... on the issue of Wall Street, when our reporters go out and talk to people on the ground in the early states, what they tell us over and over again when they find voters who are leaning toward Senator Sanders rather than yourself is that the most frequent area of concern that they hear from those voters is the issue of Wall Street and whether or not you are too close to Wall Street.Last night, when you were asked about speaking fees and the amount of speaking fees you got from Goldman Sachs speeches, you said thats what they offered.Have you been too dismissive of voters concerns about this issue in your own campaign and your own career?CLINTON: Well you know, Rachel, I think I may not have done the job I should in explaining my record. You know, I did  when I left the secretary of States office, like so many former officials, military leaders, journalists, others, I did go on the speaking circuit. I spoke to heart doctors, I spoke to the American Camping Association, I spoke to auto dealers, and yes, I spoke to firms on Wall Street. They wanted me to talk about the world, what my experience had been as secretary of State.But what I want people to know is I went to Wall Street before the crash. I was the one saying youre going to wreck the economy because of these shenanigans with mortgages. I called to end the carried interest loophole that hedge fund managers enjoy. I proposed changes in CEO compensation.I called for a consumer protection financial bureau before it was created. And I think the best evidence that the Wall Street people at least know where I stand and where I have always stood is because they are trying to beat me in this primary. They have collected and spent as much as $6 million on these ads. Hedge fund billionaires, Karl Rove, another billionaire, jumped in.And why are they doing that? These are guys who try to make smart investments. They know my record, they know me, they know that I say what I believe and I will do it. And I also have a pretty good understanding about how to stop them.So I do want people to know that, and I think its important for everybody to understand I have a record, I have stood firm and I will be the person who prevents them from ever wrecking the economy again.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders, you have been a critic of Secretary Clinton taking those speaking fees and having donations from Wall Street. What about her defense of her record? SANDERS: Let me just say this. Wall Street is perhaps the most powerful economic and political force in this country. You have companies like Goldman Sachs, who just recently paid a settlement fine with the federal government for $5 billion for defrauding investors.Goldman Sachs was one of those companies whose illegal activity helped destroy our economy and ruin the lives of millions of Americans. But this is what a rigged economy and a corrupt campaign finance system and a broken criminal justice is about. These guys are so powerful that not one of the executives on Wall Street has been charged with anything after paying, in this case of Goldman Sachs, a $5 billion fine.Kid gets caught with marijuana, that kid has a police record. A Wall Street executive destroys the economy, $5 billion settlement with the government, no criminal record. That is what power is about. That is what corruption is about. And that is what has to change in the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: If I could, let me just say that of course it has to change. It has to change. And thats why I have put forward a plan to do just that. And its been judged to be the toughest, most effective and comprehensive one.I have great respect for Senator Sanderss commitment to try to restore Glass-Steagall. But I do not believe that that is enough. And in fact, I dont believe it really addresses a lot of the biggest issues we have.You know, we now have power under the Dodd-Frank legislation to break up banks. And Ive said I will use that power if they pose a systemic risk. But I want to go further, because it was investment banks, it was insurance companies, it was mortgage companies, all of which contributed.So lets not just be narrowly focused on one part of the problem. We have a lot of issues with corporate power that have to be addressed. My plan takes us further and it would do the job.(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE) SANDERS: I would say that  that folks who have looked at this issue for a long time, whether its Elizabeth Warren or many other economists, will tell you that right now, yes, we do need a 21st century Glass-Steagall legislation. And I would tell you also that when you have three out of the four largest banks in America today, bigger than they were  significantly bigger than when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, a good Republican by the way, what he would say is: Break them up; they are too powerful economically; they are too powerful politically.And that is what I believe and many economists believe. Time to break them up.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Look we have a law  look, you know, I  I appreciate the senators advocacy. We have a law. It was passed. It was signed by President Obama. It lays out a process that you go through to determine whether a systemic risk is posed.And by the way, President Obama signed that, pushed it through, even though he took donations from Wall Street, because hes a responsible president. So we have a law in place. If the circumstances warrant it, I will certainly use it. And from what you say, I know you will as well.But that is not enough. And I keep going back to this because part of the reason the Wall Street guys are trying so hard to stop me  the hedge fund guys, the shadow banking guys  is because Ive got their number on all of that. And my plan goes so much further to try to prevent the problems of the future.You know, we cant just fight the last war. Weve got to be prepared to stop these guys if they ever try to use their economic power once again, to hurt the economy, and to hurt so many Americans. And my plan, Paul Krugman, Barney Frank, a lot of experts who understand what the new challenges might be, have said I am exactly on point, and the Wall Street guys actually know that.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)TODD: ... she has had more people praise her plan than yours.SANDERS: Well, weve had a number of economists supporting our legislation. And heres where we are. The American people can judge. Six largest financial institutions in America today have assets of roughly $10 trillion; equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of the United States of America.SANDERS: That is a lot of money. They issue two thirds of the credit cards, and by the way theyre ripping off a whole lot of people with high interest rates on the credit cards, and they write about one third of the mortgages.That is a lot of power for six financial institutions. Thats it. I think it is too much power. Too much economic power, too much political power, and the economists that I talk to say we should break them up.TODD: Thank you both. Let me move on to our next question here, and in fact it comes to us through New England Cable News.Secretary Clinton, its addressed to you, and its about this issue of the speeches, particularly to Goldman Sachs. This is what the questioner wrote verbatim.I am concerned with the abuses of Wall Street has taken with the American taxpayers money, and then she asks whether you would release the transcripts of your Goldman Sachs speeches, and then added, Dont you think the voting public has a right to know what was said?But, lets make that bigger. Are you willing to release the transcripts of all your paid speeches? We do know through reporting that there were transcription services for all of those paid speeches. In full disclosure, would you release all of them?CLINTON: I will look into it. I dont know the status, but I will certainly look into it. But, I can only repeat what is the fact that I spoke to a lot of different groups with a lot of different constituents, a lot of different kinds of members about issues that had to do with world affairs. I probably described more times than I can remember how stressful it was advising the President about going after Bin Laden.My view on this is look at my record. Look at what I am proposing, and  we have a vigorous agreement here. We both want to reign in the excesses of Wall Street. I also want to reign in the excesses of Johnson Controls that we bailed out when they were an autoparts company, and we saved the auto industry, and now they want to avoid paying taxes.I want to go after the pharmaceutical companies like Valeant, and Turns that are increasing prices without any regard to the impact on peoples health. Now, if all were going to talk about is one part of our economy, and indeed one streak in our economy, were missing the big oil companies. Were missing other big energy companies. Were missing the big picture, and I have a record of trying to go at the problems that actually exist, and I will continue to do that.TODD: Senator, you sound like you want to respond. Go ahead.SANDERS: Yeah, I do. I agree with much of what the Secretary said, but, madam Secretary, it is not one streak. Wall Street is an entity of unbelievable economic and political power. Thats a fact.And, I want to say something, and it may sound harsh, not to you, but to the American people. In a sense, in my view, the business model of Wall Street is fraud. Its fraud. I believe that corruption is rampant, and the fact that major bank after major bank has reached multi billion dollar settlements with the United States government when we have a weak regulator system tells me that not only did we have to bail them out once, if we dont start breaking them up, were going to have to bail them out again, and I do not want to see that happen...CLINTON: ... Well, Senator, no one wants to see that happen. I mean, look, I care deeply about this because just like you I have met so many people who had their life savings wiped out, who lost their homes, who are barely back with their heads above water.This was a disaster for our country, and we can never let that happen again. We have no disagreement about this. But, I think its a broader target list than just Wall Street, and I believe that we have to be very focused on how we try to take back the power and increase the empowerment of the American people. And, I think I have that kind of experience, maybe because theyve beat me up for so many years, and I know exactly how to handle them because Ive been in the arena with them time and time again.MADDOW: Senator Sanders, let me turn to, I think, where this direction is heading anyway, which is the broader issue of big business and power in our political system. You on the campaign trail have railed against big name American corporations like Boeing, and General Electric, and Wal Mart. But, some big businesses in this country have also been part of advancing progressive goals like that nationwide initiative to expand employment opportunities for veterans. That was all about cooperation between the Obama administration and some very big business. The Affordable Care Act, some of the thorniest problems in that bill were worked out in cooperation with big business in order to accomplish progressive goals.Could you work with them, or have you made enemies of big business in this country with the way youve approached them in this campaign?SANDERS: Of course I can work with them, but lets be clear. When I talked about Boeing and I talked about General Electric, what I was referring to is an outrage. I suspect the secretary agrees request me.Right now you have a loophole such that these guys are putting their profits, multi-billion dollar profitable corporations putting billions of dollars into the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, and other tax havens.And in a given year, Rachel, after making billions of dollars in profit, do you know how much theyre paying in taxes to the United States government in a given year? Zero. Now explain to me how that makes any sense at all.So what I have said with regard to Boeing and GE and other multinationals that pay zero taxes, you know what were going to do? Were going to end that loophole. They are going to pay their fair share of taxes.Were going to use that money to rebuild our infrastructure and create up to 13 million jobs.Can I work with corporations? Are there good corporations doing incredible cutting edge research and development? Absolutely they are. And we should be proud of them.But on the other hand, there are many corporations who have turned their backs on the American worker, who have said, if I can make another nickel in profit by going to China and shutting down in the United States of America, thats what I will do.I will do my best to transform our trade policy and take on these corporations who want to invest in low-income countries around the world rather than in the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders, thank you.And with that, were going to take a break.TODD: Well be right back. And were going to get to trade and a lot of other issues.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MADDOW: Welcome back  welcome back to the Democratic candidates debate. Were going to be talking about America in the world, both in terms of some trade issues, but also national security.And Secretary Clinton, were going to start with you. There are more than 4,000 American troops back in Iraq right now as part of the fight against ISIS. It has been 15 straight years of wars and multiple deployments for Americas military families, who have borne such a disproportionate burden.Is President Obama right to keep escalating the number of U.S. troops thats fighting ISIS right now?CLINTON: Well, I think what the president understands, and what hes trying to do, is that we have to support the Arab and Kurdish fighters on the ground who are actually doing the fighting.I agree with the president. Ive said myself, we will not send American combat troops back to either Syria or Iraq  that is off the table.But we do have special forces, we do have trainers, we do have the military personnel who are helping with the airstrikes that the United States is leading so that we can try to take out ISIS infrastructure, take out their leadership.And I think that, given the threat that ISIS poses to the region and beyond, as we have sadly seen in our own country, it is important to keep the Iraqi army on a path where they can actually take back territory, to work with the Sunni tribes in Anbar province and elsewhere so that their fighters can be also deployed, to work with the Kurds to provide them the support, but theyre doing the fighting. Were doing the support and enabling.And I also think weve got to do more to stop foreign fighters, foreign funding and take ISIS on online, as well as doing everything necessary to keep us safe at home.So as I look at what the president it doing, it adds up to me. We just have to keep  try to get more support for those people on the ground in Syria and Iraq who have to actually physically take the territory back. MADDOW: To be clear, to the specific question, if that strategic goal that youre describing requires considerably more of Americans  an ever-increasing number of Americans in Iraq and maybe in Syria, are you OK with the numbers increasing?CLINTON: No. I mean, of course thats a theoretical question, and we dont know what it would be for, and we dont know how many numbers there are. I am against American combat troops being in Syria and Iraq.I support special forces. I support trainers. I support the air campaign. And I think were making some progress. I want to continue to intensify that, and thats exactly what the president is doing.MADDOW: Thank you, Madam Secretary.TODD: Go ahead, Senator Sanders  30 seconds, your response.SANDERS: OK. Let me agree with much of what the secretary said, but where we have a different background on this issue is we differ on the war in Iraq, which created barbaric organizations like ISIS.Not only did I vote against that war, I helped lead the opposition, and if you go to my website,berniesanders.com, you will see the statement that I made in 2002. And it gives me no pleasure to tell you that much of what I feared would happen the day after Saddam Hussein was overthrown, in fact, did happen.TODD: All right. Senator, I want to stay, though...CLINTON: If I could  if I could...TODD: Go ahead. 30 seconds.CLINTON: ... respectfully add  look, we did differ. A vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat ISIS. We have to look at the threats that we face right now...(APPLAUSE)... and we have to be prepared to take them on and defeat them.TODD: Let me  let  were gonna  were staying  were staying basically on this topic. Obviously youve been emphasizing this difference on the Iraq war, but one place where you do agree, and one place where you voted to authorize the use of force, was in favor of the war in Afghanistan.Right now, it is possible President Obama is going to be leaving the next president, perhaps President Sanders, at least 10,000 troops in Afghanistan. How long will those troops be in Afghanistan under President Sanders?SANDERS: Well, I think our great task is to make certain that our young men and women in the military do not get sucked into never- ending, perpetual warfare within the quagmire of Syria and Iraq. And I will do my very best to make sure that that doesnt happen.I agree with the secretary that I think what has to happen  and let me just mention what King Abdullah of Jordan said. I think he hit the nail on the head. SANDERS: And what he said is essentially the war against ISIS is a war for the soul of Islam. And it must be Muslim troops on the ground that will destroy ISIS, with the support of a coalition of major powers  U.S., U.K., France, Germany and Russia.So our job is to provide them the military equipment that they need; the air support they need; special forces when appropriate. But at the end of the day for a dozen different reasons, not the least of which is that ISIS would like American combat troops on the ground so they could reach out to the Muslim world and say, Look, were taking on those terrible Americans.The combat on the ground must be done by Muslim troops with our support. We must not get involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.TODD: Can you address a question on Afghanistan?(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)TODD: How long are these troops going to be there? If President Obama leaves you 10,000 troops, how long do you think theyre going to be there?SANDERS: Well, you cant simply withdraw tomorrow. Wish we could, and allow, you know, the Taliban or anybody else to reclaim that country. But what we must do, and what we have seen in recent months, is some progress in Iraq, where finally the Iraqi army, which has not been a particularly effective fighting force, retook Ramadi. ISIS has lost I think 40 percent of the territory that it held in the last year.Hopefully, and you know, one cant predict the future, that maybe our training and their fighting capabilities are improving and we are going to make some progress in destroying ISIS.TODD: Secretary Clinton, 30 seconds: How long are these troops going to be in Afghanistan? We have more American troops in Afghanistan than what we were talking about with Iraq.CLINTON: Oh, absolutely. The president decided to leave more troops than he had originally planned in Afghanistan. We have a very cooperative government there, with Ashraf Ghani and his top  his top partner, Abdullah. And they are doing their very best. And the Afghan army is actually fighting. The Afghan army is taking heavy losses defending Afghan territory.And I would have to make an evaluation based on the circumstances at the time I took office as to how much help they continue to need. Because its not just the Taliban. We now are seeing outposts of, you know, fighters claiming to be affiliated with ISIS.So, weve got this arc of instability from North Africa to South Asia, and we have to pay close attention to it. And we have to build coalitions, something that I did to take on the Iranian nuclear program, and what I will do as president to make sure that we defeat these terrorist networks.TODD: You know, Senator Sanders, nobody knows who your foreign policy advisers are. You havent given a major foreign policy speech. And it doesnt sound like all the time that foreign policy is a priority, other than when youre asked about it, and you say youre going to crush ISIS, as you said last night and earlier.You have not proactively laid out a foreign policy doctrine yet. Why?SANDERS: Well, thats not quite accurate. I did give a speech at Georgetown where I talked about democratic socialism and foreign policy. Maybe I shouldnt have combined the two in the same speech, because the foreign policy part of it didnt get much attention. So, let me take this opportunity to give you a very short speech here on the issue.I think, while it is true that the secretary and I voted differently on the war in Iraq, what is important is that we learn the lesson of the war in Iraq. And that lesson is intrinsic to my foreign policy if elected president, is the United States cannot do it alone. We cannot be the policeman of the world. We are now spending more I believe than the next eight countries on defense. We have got to work in strong coalition with the major powers of the world and with those Muslim countries that are prepared to stand up and take on terrorism.So I would say that the key doctrine of the Sanders administration would be no, we cannot continue to do it alone; we need to work in coalition.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: A group of national security experts, military intelligence experts, issued a very concerning statement about Senator Sanderss views on foreign policy and national security, pointing out some of the comments he has made on these issues, such as inviting Iranian troops into Syria to try to resolve the conflict there; putting them right at the doorstep of Israel. Asking Saudi Arabia and Iran to work together, when they cant stand each other and are engaged in a proxy battle right at this moment.CLINTON: So I do think questions have been raised and questions have to be answered because when New Hampshire voters go on Tuesday to cast your vote, you are voting both for a president and a commander in chief. And there is no way to predict what comes in the door of that White House from day to day that can pose a threat to the United States or one of our friends and allies, and I think this is a big part of the job interview that we are all conducting with the voters here.TODD: All right, Senator, 30 seconds.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: (OFF-MIKE) I fully, fully concede that Secretary Clinton, who was secretary of State for four years, has more experience  hat is not arguable  in foreign affairs. But experience is not the only point, judgment is. And once again, back in 2002, when we both looked at the same evidence about the wisdom of the war in Iraq, one of us voted the right way and one of us didnt.In terms of Iran and in terms of Saudi Arabia, of course they hate each other. Thats no great secret. But John Kerry, who is I think doing a very good job, has tried to at least get these people in the room together because both of them are being threatened by ISIS.CLINTON: Well, let me just add that, you know, Ive said this before and Im very proud of it, that when it comes to judgment, having run a hard race against Senator Obama at the time, he turned to me to be secretary of State. And when it comes to the biggest counterterrorism issues that we faced in this administration, namely whether or not to go after bin Laden, I was at that table, I was exercising my judgment to advise the president on what to do, on that, on Iran, on Russia on China, on a whole raft of issues.Because I know from my own experience that youve got to be ready on day one. There is just too much unpredictable threat and danger in the world today, you know, to try to just say wait, Ill get to that when I can. That is just not an acceptable approach.SANDERS: Well...MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, at the  at the last Democratic debate in Charleston  I want to get specific here  Senator Sanders called for moving as aggressively as we can to normalize relations with Iran. Your campaign has criticized him for saying that. Now that hes standing next to you here on this stage, can you explain why the U.S. shouldnt try to normalize relations in Iran in your view?CLINTON: Absolutely. You know, I did put together the coalition to impose sanctions. I actually started the negotiations that led to the nuclear agreement, sending some much my closest aides to begin the conversations with the Iranians.Im very pleased we got that nuclear agreement. It puts a lid on the nuclear weapons program. We have to enforce it, there have to be consequences attached to it. But that is not our only problem with Iran. We have to figure out how to deal with Iran as the principal state sponsor of terrorism in the world.They are destabilizing governments in the region. They continue to support Hezbollah and Hamas in Lebanon against Israel. A lot of work that we have do is going to be incredibly hard. Im prepared to do that work, but I believe, just as I did with imposing the sanctions, you have to get action for action.If we were to normalize relations right now, we would remove one of the biggest pieces of leverage we have to try to influence and change Iranian behavior. The president doesnt think we should. I certainly dont think we should. I believe we have to take this step by step to try to reign in Iranian aggression, their support for terrorism and the other bad behavior that can come back and haunt us.SANDERS: Who said That think we should normalize relations with Iran tomorrow? I never said that. I think we should move forward as quickly as we can.And youre right. They are a sponsor of terrorism around the world and we have to address that. But you know, a number of years ago, people were saying normal relationship with Cuba, what a bad and silly idea. Theyre Communists, they are our enemy. Well guess what? Change has come.So please dont suggest that I think we normalize relations with Tehran tomorrow. We dont. But I would like to see us move forward, and hopefully some day that will happen. And I would say if I might, Madam Secretary  and you can correct me if Im wrong. When you ran against Senator Obama you thought him naive because he thought it was a good idea to talk to our enemies. I think those are exactly the people you have to talk to and you have to negotiate with.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well Senator, let me just correct the record if I can. You know  let me correct the record.(CROSSTALK)TODD: 30 seconds, madam secretary.CLINTON: As I  as I certainly recall, the question was to meet with without conditions. And youre right, I was against that. I was against it then I would be against it now.SANDERS: OK.CLINTON: Part of diplomacy, the hard work of diplomacy is trying to extract whatever concessions you can get, and giving something the other side wants. Of course youve got to try to make peace with, and work with those who are your adversaries, but you dont just rush in, open the door, and say, Here I am. Lets talk and make a deal.Thats not the way it works.SANDERS: I think President Obama had the right idea, and the bottom line is that of course there have to be conditions. But, of course it doesnt do us any good to not talk with our adversaries...CLINTON: ... Well, we set conditions on Iran. We worked hard to get them established, and to be enforced, and then we talked. Thats exactly the right...(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: ... And, thats what I did with the President, so he and I are on the very same page.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Just to set the record straight, I very strongly supported the agreement which makes certain that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon.TODD: Alright, as Commander in Chief, Senator Sanders, youve got to prioritize potential threats to the United States. Three countries, North Korea, Iran, Russia. How would you rank them in order of their threat to Americas security right now...SANDERS: ... ISIS...TODD: ... Starting with the biggest threat.SANDERS: ISIS, you forgot one...TODD: ... I didnt say that...SANDERS: ... No, no...TODD: ... No...SANDERS: ... ISIS would be ...TODD: ... We already had that. Im talking about these three countries. How would you orient our national security, our national defense posture.SANDERS: Clearly North Korea is a very strange situation because it is such an isolated country run by a handful of dictators, or maybe just one, who seems to be somewhat paranoid. And, who had nuclear weapons.And, our goal there, in my view, is to work and lean strongly on China to put as much pressure. China is one of the few major countries in the world that has significant support for North Korea, and I think we got to do everything we can to put pressure on China. I worry very much about an isolated, paranoid country with atomic bombs.I think, clearly, we got to work closely with China to resolve the serious problems we have, and I worry about Putin and his military adventurism in the Crimea and the Ukraine.TODD: Secretary of Defense Ash Carter this week picked one of those three, and he has said Russia is, basically, the most important national security threat. Sort of reorienting the defense and the challenges to that. Do you agree with his decisions...SANDERS: ... No, I dont. I worry very, very much about an isolated country. Thats what makes me nervous. Russia lives in the world. China lives in the world. North Korea is a very, very strange country because it is so isolated, and I do feel that a nation with nuclear weapons, they have got to be dealt with. Dealt with effectively.TODD: Secretary Clinton, what do you think of Secretary of Defense Ash Carter. Hes basically putting Russia above Iran, above North Korea, as sort of the chief national security challenge right now.CLINTON: I havent talked to Secretary Carter, but heres what I would think hes planning. We do have the nuclear weapons agreement with Iran, thats an enforcement consequence, action for action, follow on. We have a plan, we will watch them, we will be vigilant.We do have to worry about North Korea. They continue to develop their nuclear weapons capability, and theyre working very hard on their ballistic missile capability.And, I know that some of those plans could very well lead to a missile that might reach Hawaii, if not the West Coast. We do have to try to get the countries in the region to work with us to do everything we can to confine, and constrain them.But, what Secretary Carter is looking at is the constant pressure that Russias putting on our European allies. The way that Russia is trying to move the boundaries of the post-World War II Europe. The way that he is trying to set European countries against one another, seizing territory, holding it in Crimea. Beginning to explore whether they could make some inroads in the Baltics.We know that they are deeply engaged in supporting Assad because they want to have a place in the Middle East. They have a naval base, they have an air base in Syria. They want to hang on to that. I think what Secretary Carter is seeing, and Im glad he is, is that we got to get NATO back working for the common defense. Weve got to do more to support our partners in NATO, and we have to send a very clear message to Putin that this kind of belligerence, that this kind of testing of boundaries will have to be responded to. The best way to do that is to put more armor in, put more money from the Europeans in so theyre actually contributing more to their own defense.TODD: Thank you both, Rachel?MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, I want to ask you about a national security issue that is closer to home. There are thousands of veterans, over 100,000 veterans living in the state of New Hampshire.If either one of you is nominated as the Democratic Partys nominee, you will likely face a Republican opponent in the general election who wants to privatize or even abolish big parts of the V.A. Its a newly popular idea in conservative politics.How will you win the argument on that issue given the problems that have been exposed at the V.A. in the last few years? Whats your argument that the V.A. should still exist and should not be privatized?CLINTON: Well, first of all, Im absolutely against privatizing the V.A. And I am going do everything I can to build on the reforms that Senator Sanders and others in Congress have passed to try to fix whats wrong with the V.A.There are a lot of issues about wait times and services that have to be fixed because our veterans deserve nothing but the best.But youre absolutely right, you know, Rachel, this is another part of the Koch brothers agenda. Theyve actually formed an organization to try to begin to convince Americans we should no longer have guaranteed health care, specialized care for our veterans.I will fight that as hard as I can. I think theres where we can enlist the veterans service organizations, the veterans of America, because, yes, lets fix the V.A., but we will never let it be privatized, and that is a promise.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders, you, as a congressional leader on veterans issues and the Veterans Committee, youve worked in a very bipartisan way with Senator John McCain and others on veterans issues. Is the right contour of the fight, the way shes talking about this issue?SANDERS: Let me agree. You know, as the secretary knows, I chaired  I had the privilege and the honor of chairing the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs. And it is interesting to me, you know, Republicans give a lot of speeches about how much they love veterans. I work with the American Legion, the VFW, the DAV, the Vietnam Vets, and virtually every veterans organization to put together the most comprehensive piece of the veterans legislation in the modern history of America. Thats what I did.And I brought it to the floor of the Senate. Every Democrat voted for it, I got two Republicans. We ended up with 56 votes and I couldnt get the 60 votes that I needed. That is pathetic.This was legislation supported by all of the veterans organizations, addressing many of the serious problems that veterans face in health care and in how we deliver benefits to them.So Republicans talk a good game about veterans, but when it came to put money on the line to protect our veterans, frankly, they were not there.What I did next, Rachel, is I had to retreat a little bit, I had to compromise. I did work with John McCain. I did work with Jeff Miller over in the House. And we put together not the bill that I wanted, but probably the most comprehensive V.A. health care bill in the modern history of this country.Secretary Clinton is absolutely right, there are people, Koch brothers among others, who have a group called Concerned Veterans of America, funded by the Koch brothers. The Koch brothers, by the way, want to destroy Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, every governmental program passed since the 1930s. Yes, there are people out there who want to privatize it.The last point that Id make. I had a hearing. I had all of the veterans groups in front of me. And I said to them, tell me when a veteran gets in to the V.A., understanding there are waiting lines and real problems, when a veteran gets into the system, is the quality of care good?Without exception, what they said, good, excellent, very good. Weve got to strengthen the V.A. We do not privatize the V.A.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Thank you, Senator.Senator Sanders, Secretary Clinton, were going to take another break. Well be talking about Social Security and some of those other issues when we come back.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)TODD: And we are back. Were gonna get into a little bit of election politics, electability, in a little bit.Senator Sanders, The Iowa Democratic Party has declared Hillary Clinton the winner of Mondays Iowa caucuses  narrowest of margins. Today, the Des Moines Register has an editorial that calls for the audit of the results, saying, quote, what happened Monday night at the Democratic caucuses was a debacle, period. The results were too close not to do a complete audit.Senator Sanders, do you accept the idea that Hillary Clinton won Iowa? And do you  or do you believe the caucuses are still an open question?SANDERS: Well, I agree with the Des Moines Register, but lets not blow this out of proportion. This is not a  this is not, like, a winner-take-all thing.I think where we now stand  correct me if Im wrong  you have 22 delegates, I have 20 delegates. We need 2,500 delegates to win the nomination.(LAUGHTER)You know, so this is not  this is not the biggest deal in the world. We think, by the way, based on talking to our precinct captains, we may have at least two more delegates.What the Des Moines Register said  you know, there were coin  I think there were half a dozen coin flips  a fairly chaotic type situation. At the end of the day, no matter how its recounted, it will break roughly even.And by the way, I love and respect the caucus process in Iowa. See, and I dont have to say it, because they voted already.(LAUGHTER)And I love New Hampshire, too, because you havent voted, but...(APPLAUSE)... but, look, I think people are blowing this up out of proportion. But I think we need improvements in the process by which results are determined.TODD: Secretary Clinton, will you participate in some sort of audit, if thats what the party wants to do? You good with that?CLINTON: Whatever they decide to do, thats fine.TODD: Thats fair enough. OK.CLINTON: All right.TODD: Good, we move on. Were happy with that. We have more questions.MADDOW: Senator  Senator Sanders, in 1964...SANDERS: Oh (inaudible).(LAUGHTER)See, when you are old, then they go back all these years. All right. What have you got?MADDOW: In 1964, I heard that the Republicans nominated Barry Goldwater, who was the hero of the conservative movement. He was, however, far to the right of most of that party. In 1972, the Democrats nominated George McGovern, who was a hero of liberals in the antiwar movement, but he was to the left of his partys mainstream.Both of those nominees made activists very excited, and they both got destroyed in the general election. Even Democrats who love you worry about your fate in a general election. And I know you have good head-to-head polling numbers against Republican frontrunners right now. We know that. But do you have a general election strategy that is different than the way youre running right now to try to get the nomination?SANDERS: Well, you know, a general election is different than a primary and caucus process. But let me just say this. In terms of where we are right now, as you mention, Rachel, in a number of national and state, including New Hampshire. For example, the last poll I saw  there may have been a new one  last one I saw here in New Hampshire, a battleground state, had me defeating Trump by 19; the secretary defeating him by one. There were also pretty large margins in Iowa and Wisconsin.These are polls. Polls go up. Polls go down. But heres why I think I will be, if nominated, the strongest candidate. Democrats win when there is a large voter turnout; when people are excited; when working people, middle class people and young people are prepared to engage in the political process.Republicans win when people are demoralized and you have a small voter turnout, which by the way is why they love voter suppression. I believe that our campaign up to now has shown that we can create an enormous amount of enthusiasm from working people, from young people, who will get involved in the political process and which will drive us to a very large voter turnout.If there is a large voter turnout, not only do we retain the White House, but I think we regain the Senate. We win governors chairs up and down the line. So I believe if you want to retain the White House, if you want to see Democrats do well across the board, I think our campaign is the one that creates the large voter turnout and helps us win.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, your campaign surrogates, and people who have endorsed you, have suggested that or even said that if Senator Sanders is the nominee, that Democrats will suffer nationwide and the chances will go down of Democrats holding onto the White House. With him here standing next to you, can you tell us whether or not you believe he would win the general election if he were nominated?CLINTON: I can only tell you what I believe, and that is that I am the strongest candidate to take it to the Republicans and win in November.(APPLAUSE)And I say that with great  with great respect for the campaign that Senator Sanders has been running. I personally am thrilled at the numbers of people, and particularly young people who are coming to support your campaign. I hope that I will be able to earn their support. They may not support me now, but I support them and well work together.But what Im concerned about is the views of many Democrats who know their states, who know how hard it is to win a general election. And it also will push whoever the nominee is into the spotlight. Ive been vetted. Theres hardly anything you dont know about me. And I think its fair to say that whoever is in that position, Senator Sanders or anyone else who might have run, will face the most withering onslaught.So, I think that I am the person who can do all aspects of the job. I think Im the person best prepared to take the case to the Republicans. And I think that at the end of the day, its not so much electability. It is who the American people can believe can keep them safe, can get the economy moving again, can get incomes rising, can build on the progressive accomplishments of President Obama.And I think that the coalition that President Obama put together to win twice is a coalition that I can put together and add to. And thats what Im prepared to...(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)TODD: Well stay on this issue. Well stay on this topic.TODD: Secretary Clinton, just like there are some Democrats that question Senator Sanders ability in the general election, many Democratic voters that our reporters have been running into in Iowa and New Hampshire, they tell our reporters over and over again theyre worried about the emails issue, not because they dont believe your explanation, but because its a drip-drip, because the cloud is hanging over your head and that it will impact the general election.They see your numbers right now and they think its the email issue as to why youre not polling very well. So can you reassure these Democrats that somehow the email issue isnt going to blow up your candidacy if youre the nominee?CLINTON: Absolutely I can. You know, before it was emails, it was Benghazi, and the Republicans were stirring up so much controversy about that. And I testified for 11 hours, answered their questions. They basically said yeah, didnt get her. We tried. That was all a political ploy.Now, we had a development in the email matter today when it came out that Secretary Powell and close aides to Former Secretary Rice used private e-mail accounts. and now you have these people in the government who are doing the same thing to Secretary Powell and Secretary Rices aide theyve been doing to me, which is that I never sent or received any classified material. They are retroactively classifying it.I agree completely with Secretary Powell, who said today this is an absurdity. And so I think the American people will know its an absurdity. I have absolutely no concerns about it whatsoever.(APPLAUSE)TODD: All right, Madam Secretary, there is an open  there is an open FBI investigation into this matter about how you may have handled classified material. Are you 100 percent confident that nothing is going to come of this FBI investigation?CLINTON: I am 100 percent confident. This is a security review that was requested. It is being carried out. It will be resolved. But I have to add if theres going to be a security review about me, theres going to have to be security reviews about a lot of other people, including Republican office holders, because weve got this absurd situation of retroactive classifications.Honest to goodness, this is  this just beggars the imagination. So I have absolutely no concerns about it, but weve got to get to the bottom of whats really going on here, and I hope that will happen.TODD: Well, Senator sanders, you famously at the first debate said you didnt give a darn about her emails; I think you used another (inaudible).SANDERS: (OFF-MIKE)TODD: Youre right. Im trying to  its a  its a family hour still right now. After 11:00, Ill say it the other way. And you mostly have refrained from commenting on it, but recently you called it a very serious issue, and then the other day you said well shes getting slapped with the email controversy.Are you  how are you feeling about these darn emails now?SANDERS: I am feeling exactly the way I felt at the first debate. Theres a process under way. I will not politicize it.TODD: OK. Senator Sanders, thank you.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: And by the way  and by the way, if I may, the secretary probably doesnt know that theres not a day that goes by when I am not asked to attack her on that issue, and I have refrained from doing that and I will continue to refrain from doing that.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders, thank you. Senator, in December, one of your campaign staffers was fired from your campaign for taking voter data essentially from the Clinton campaign. You apologized for that when the incident was made public.Your campaign has now been criticized for its operatives essentially impersonating culinary union members wearing union pins in Nevada, and the Nashua Telegraph has complained recently that you falsely implied in an advertisement that they had endorsed you when they did not.None of these issues obviously is the end of the world, but they all are of a piece. Are you in some sense losing control of your campaign?SANDERS: Not losing control of our campaign. You know, we have hired a whole lot of people in a rapid way and I am familiar with the first two instances and they are unacceptable, and we have apologized and dealt with that.In terms of the last one, as I understand it, we did not suggest that we had the endorsement of a newspaper. Newspapers who make endorsements also say positive things about other candidates, and to the best of my knowledge, that is what we did. So we never said, never said that somebody, a newspaper endorsed us that did not. What we did say is blah blah blah blah was said by the newspaper.MADDOW: Just to follow up on that, the title of the ad in question was Endorsement.SANDERS: But that was only for  that was not to be on television. Thats an important point. That was just something  as the secretary knows, you put titles on ads and you send them out, but there was no word in that ad, none, that said that those newspapers had endorsed us.MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, do you want 30 seconds on that issue? CLINTON: No.MADDOW: And with that, we will (inaudible).(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MADDOW: Welcome back to the University of New Hampshire, and the Democratic candidates debate.Secretary Clinton, on the issue of the death penalty, here in New Hampshire, the one person who is on death row is there for killing a police officer. Its a crime that has caused anguish in this state, both among death penalty opponents and death penalty supporters.The last time I had the chance to talk with you on this issue, on the death penalty, you said that capital punishment has a place in a very few federal cases, but you also said you would breathe a sigh of relief if the Supreme Court abolished the death penalty nationwide. Tonight, do you still support capital punishment, even if you do so reluctantly?CLINTON: Yes, I do. And  you know, what I hope the Supreme Court will do is make it absolutely clear that any state that continues capital punishment either must meet the highest standards of evidentiary (ph) proof of effective assistance of counsel or they cannot continue it because that, to me, is the real dividing line.I have much more confidence in the federal system, and I do reserve it for particularly heinous crimes in the federal system, like terrorism. I have strong feelings about that. I thought it was appropriate after a very thorough trial that Timothy McVeigh received the death penalty for blowing up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people, including 19 children in a daycare center.I do for very limited, particularly heinous crimes believe it is an appropriate punishment, but I deeply disagree with the way that too many states are still implementing it. If it were possible to separate the federal from the state system by the Supreme Court, that would, I think, be an appropriate outcome.MADDOW: Senator Sanders, you have singled out the death penalty, and Senator Clintons support for the death penalty, as an issue that makes it hard to consider as progressive in your mind...SANDERS: ... Look, I hear what the Secretary said, and I understand, but look, there are  all of us know that we have seen in recent years horrible, horrible crimes. Its hard to imagine how people can do, bomb, and kill 168 people in Oklahoma City, or do the Boston Marathon bombing, but this is what I believe, and for a couple of reasons.Number one, too many innocent people, including minorities, African Americans, have been executed when they were not guilty. Thats number one. We have to be very careful about making sure about that.But, second of all, and maybe, in a deeper reason, of course there are barbaric acts out there. But, in a world of so much violence and killing, I just dont believe that government itself should be part of the killing. So, when somebody commits...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: ... Somebody commits any of these terrible crimes that we have seen, you lock them up, and you toss away the key. Theyre never going to get out. But, I just dont want to see government be part of killing. Thats all. (APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Another issue related to the proper role of government, and in this case, specifically the role of government between the federal government and the states. I want to talk for a moment about the issue of Flint, Michigan. On the Flint lead poisoning disaster, you have both been highly critical of Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan, and how the state in Michigan both caused the lead poisoning problem, and has not acted fast enough to fix it. You have both been outspoken on that.The fact is that Michigan though has not fixed it. There is no door to door delivery of clean water in Flint even today. Not a single lead pipe has been replaced in Flint, even today. If the state is failing, would you, Secretary Clinton, would you as President order a federal response to get it right over and above the wishes of the state?CLINTON: Absolutely. Absolutely. You know, Rachel, you and I have talked about this before. I thank you for going to Flint to hold that town hall. I will be in Flint at the Mayors invitation on Sunday to get an in depth briefing about what is, and is not happening.This is an emergency. Everyday that goes by that these people, particularly the children, are not tested so we can know what steps must be taken to try to remediate the effects of the poisoning that they have been living with is a day lost in a childs life. I know from the work that Ive done over so many years, lead, the toxic nature of lead can affect you brain development, your body development, your behavior.I absolutely believe that what is being done is not sufficient. We need to be absolutely clear about everything that should be done from today to tomorrow, into the future to try to remedy the terrible burden that the people of Flint are barring. That includes fixing their pipes, it includes guaranteeing whatever healthcare and educational embellishments they may need going forward, and I think the federal government has way where it can bill the state of Michigan. If Michigan wont do it, there have to be ways that we can begin to move, and then make them pay for it, and hold them accountable.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders are there things the President could be doing? President Obama could be ordering, done, right now, in Flint, Michigan that are not being done that you as President would do?SANDERS: Absolutely. I think the Secretary described the situation appropriately.SANDERS: You know, I dont go around asking for governors resignations every day. In fact, I think I never have in my life. But I did ask for the resignation of Governor Snyder because his irresponsibility...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: ... was so outrageous.What we are talking about are children being poisoned. Thats what were talking about. We dont know, no one knows for sure because they havent done the appropriate studies, but theres no question that kids intellectual development may have been impacted. We dont know how many thousands.The idea that there has not been a dramatic response is beyond comprehension. And when you have one of the, I think, significant public health crises of recent years, of course the federal government comes in.And of course the federal government says, youre not going to be poisoning little kids and impacting their entire lives.Last point on this. And I suspect the secretary agrees. One wonders if this were a white suburban community what kind of response there would have been.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Flint, Michigan, is a poor community. It is disproportionately African-American and minority. And what has happened there is absolutely unacceptable.MADDOW: Senator, thank you.TODD: Secretary Clinton, let me turn to the issue of trade. In the 90s you supported NAFTA. But you opposed it when you ran for the president in 2008. As secretary of state, you supported TPP, and then  which, of course, is that trade agreement with a lot of Asian countries, but you now oppose it as you make your second bid for president.If elected, should Democrats expect that once youre in office you will then become supportive of these trade agreements again?CLINTON: You know, Chuck, Ive only had responsibility for voting for trade agreements as a senator. And I voted a multinational trade agreement when I was senator, the CAFTA agreement, because I did not believe it was in the best interests of the workers of America, of our incomes, and I opposed it.I did hope that the TPP, negotiated by this administration, would put to rest a lot of the concerns that many people have expressed about trade agreements. And I said that I was holding out that hope that it would be the kind of trade agreement that I was looking for.I waited until it had actually been negotiated because I did want to give the benefit of the doubt to the administration. Once I saw what the outcome was, I opposed it.Now I have a very clear view about this. We have to trade with the rest of the world. We are 5 percent of the worlds population. We have to trade with the other 95 percent. And trade has to be reciprocal. Thats the way the global economy works.But we have failed to provide the basic safety net support that American workers need in order to be able to compete and win in the global economy. So its not just whats in the trade agreement that Im interested in.I did help to renegotiate the trade agreement that we inherited from President Bush with Korea. We go the UAW on board because of changes we made. So there are changes that I believe would make a real difference if they could be achieved, but I do not currently support it as it is written.TODD: Well, Senator Sanders, I know you want to respond on this, you have never supported a trade deal since youve been in Congress.SANDERS: Absolutely right.TODD: But if you do that as president...(APPLAUSE)TODD: If you do that as president, how are you not essentially letting China, who will do all of these deals around the world, how are you going to prevent China from essentially setting the rules of trade for the world?SANDERS: Chuck, I believe in trade, but I do not believe in unfettered free trade. I believe in fair trade which works for the middle class and working families of this country and not just large multinational corporations.I was not only in opposition to NAFTA  and this is an area where the secretary and I have disagreements. I was not only in opposition to NAFTA, I was on the picket line in opposition to NAFTA because I understood  I dont think this is really rocket science.We heard all of the people tell us how many great jobs would be created. I didnt believe that for a second because I understood what the function of NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China, and the TPP is, its to say to American workers, hey, you are now competing against people in Vietnam who make 56 cents an hour minimum wage.I dont want American workers to compete against people making 56 cents an hour. I dont want companies shutting down in America, throwing people out on the street, moving to China, and bringing their products back into this country.SANDERS: So, do I believe in trade? Of course, I believe in trade. But the current trade agreements over the last 30 years were written by corporate America, for corporate America, resulted in the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs, 60,000 factories in America lost since 2001, millions of decent-paying jobs; and also a downward spiral, a race to the bottom where employers say, Hey, you dont want to take a cut in pay? Were going to China.Workers today are working longer hours for lower wages. Trade is one of the reasons for that.(APPLAUSE)TODD: All right. Thank you both.Were going to sneak in one more break here, and when we come back well squeeze as many questions as we can before we end this thing. Well be right back.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)TODD: All right. Welcome back here in the final minutes.MADDOW: The home stretch.TODD: The home stretch of this only Democratic debate in the final week before the primary.Let me start with you, Secretary Clinton, on this question. Obviously, President Obama got a lot of ambitious stuff done in his first year and a half. Youre going to have to make choices. And theres a lot of heavy lifts. And he made choices. He did healthcare and it came at the expense, arguably, of immigration reform. Had he put immigration reform first, perhaps that gets done and healthcare doesnt.TODD: So there are three big lifts that youve talked about: immigration, gun reform, climate change. What do you do first? Because you know the first one is the one you have the best shot at getting done.CLINTON: Well, I  I dont accept that premise, Chuck. I think that weve got so much business we have to do. Weve talked a lot tonight about what were against  were against income inequality. Were against the abuses of powerful interests. Were against a lot of things.Im for a lot of things. I dont want to just stop bad things from happening, I want to start good things from happening. And I believe, if Im so fortunate to get the nomination, I will begin to work immediately on putting together an agenda, beginning to talk with members of Congress and others about how we can push forward.I want to have half a billion more solar panels deployed, the first four years.(APPLAUSE)I want to have enough clean energy to power every home the next four years. I want us to keep working on the Affordable Care Act, to get not only to 100 percent coverage, but bring down the costs of prescription drugs and out-of-pocket costs.I want to move forward on paid family leave, on early childhood education, I want us to do more for small businesses.(APPLAUSE)Small businesses have to create most of the jobs, and were not creating and growing small businesses. I think, if you have a smart agenda, you pick the committees that you know have to begin to work on these various pieces  because thats the way Congress is set up. You go through different committees, and you really make a big push in the beginning.Immigration reform, economic revitalization with manufacturing, with infrastructure  we put it out there, and we begin to work on an ambitious, big, bold agenda that will actually produce the results that I want to see for our country.TODD: All right, but Senator Sanders...(APPLAUSE)... youve still got to do something first. As you know, history said  shows what you pick first is your best shot at getting, and how you prioritize things.SANDERS: No, let...TODD: Immigration reform, for instance, fell by the wayside in the first term because of this.SANDERS: ... I am absolutely supportive of comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship for 11 million people today who are living in the shadows. All right? We got to do that.(APPLAUSE)But you miss  when you looked at the issues, you missed two of the most important. And that is youre not going to accomplish what has to be done for working families and the middle class unless there is campaign finance reform.(APPLAUSE)So long as big money interests control the United States Congress, it is gonna be very hard to do what has to be done for working families. So let me be very clear. No nominee of mine, if Im elected president, to the United States Supreme Court will get that nomination unless he or she is loud and clear, and says they will vote to overturn Citizens United.(APPLAUSE)Second point  second point is that the only way we make change in terms of health care, in terms of dealing with a broken criminal justice system which, today, allows us to have more people in jail than any other country  largely African-American and Latino  the only way we create millions of jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure or have a tax system that says to the wealthy that they are going to pay their fair share, is when millions of people become involved in the political process.No, you just cant negotiate with Mitch McConnell. Mitch is gonna have to look out the window and see a whole lot of people saying, Mitch, stop representing the billionaire class. Start listening to working families.And as president, thats what I will work hard on.(APPLAUSE)TODD: OK. Thank you.MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, Republicans, particularly in campaign years, often talk about which departments of government  which agencies of government they would get rid of if they were elected president. The EPA, the Department of Education, the Commerce Department, oops  is  is there a department of government that you would get rid of? Or is there a whole new one that you would create?CLINTON: The answer to both of those is no. Im interested in making what we have work better. I want to streamline programs that are duplicative and redundant. I want to have a top-to-bottom review about what works and what doesnt work, and be absolutely clear were getting rid of what doesnt work.I have had the opportunity to run a big agency. I was very flattered when Henry Kissinger said I ran the State Department better  better than anybody had run it in a long time. So I have an idea of what its going to take to make our government work more efficiently.And when you put together a budget, you have to make a lot of hard decisions, but I think its not appropriate to say Im going to get rid of this, get rid of that until you have a very good process that gives you the information about what to do. CLINTON: But I want to add something else, you know, because look, we have so much work to do in our country, and I think its the greatest work that Americans will be called to do. And of course, we have to have people in every community involved in it. We have to have the political voice, the political grassroots speaking up and speaking out about what we have to try to accomplish in Washington.But we also need to have a very clear set of goals that we are going to achieve, and we need to level with the American people about what they are, what they will cost, what will be expected of our citizenry. So I see as president having a constant dialogue with Americans heres what were trying to get done, heres why I need your help, heres why you may think comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship isnt something you care about, but Im telling you it will help fix the labor market, it will bring people out of the shadows MADDOW: Thank you, Secretary Clinton.CLINTON:  it will actually raise wages. You have to make all those connections so that youve got people with you every step of the way. Thats what I want to do.MADDOW: Thank you very much. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)TODD: All right, before we go, I want to ask each one of these. Secretary Clinton, youve made it clear when you look at Senator Sanders, you do not see a president, but do you see CLINTON: I never said that.TODD: But do you see  do you see a vice president?(LAUGHTER)CLINTON: Look TODD: Would you unite the party by trying to pick Senator Sanders as your running mate?CLINTON: Well, Im certainly going to unite the party, but Im not  Im not getting ahead of myself. I think that would be a little bit presumptuous. If Im so fortunate as to be the nominee, the first person I will call to talk to about where we go and how we get it done will be Senator Sanders.(APPLAUSE)TODD: Senator, would you consider the secretary?SANDERS: I agree with what the secretary said. We shouldnt be getting ahead of ourselves. And as I have said many times, you know, sometimes in these campaigns, things get a little bit out of hand. I happen to respect the secretary very much, I hope its mutual. And on our worst days, I think it is fair to say we are 100 times better than any Republican candidate.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Thats true. Thats true.(CROSSTALK)TODD: Secretary Clinton, closing statements. You are first.CLINTON: Well first, thanks to MSNBC and thanks to all of you for holding this debate before the New Hampshire primary. I am going to campaign as hard as I can between now and Tuesday to earn your votes in that primary, and I hear some talk that people are trying to decide do they vote with their heart, do they vote with their head, Im asking you to bring both your heart and your head to vote with you on Tuesday because we have a lot of work that can only come because your heart is moved.You know, we didnt get to talk about the continuing struggles that Americans face with racism, with sexism, with discrimination against the LGBT community, with new Americans, with people with disabilities. Yes, we have income inequality, we have other forms of inequality that we need to stand up against and absolutely diminish from our society.So I have been moved by my heart ever since I was a young woman about the age of a lot of Senator Sanders supporters worrying what I can do to make a difference for my country, and I will bring that heart with me, but I will also tell you weve got to get our heads together to come up with the best answers to solve the problems so that people can have real differences in their lives that will make them better for now and into the future.(APPLAUSE)TODD: Thank you, Madam Secretary. Senator Sanders.SANDERS: I  my dad came to this country at the age of 17 from Poland. Didnt have any money, couldnt speak English, he died pretty young, and I think it would have been beyond his wildest dreams to see his son up here on this stage today running for president.I love this country and my dad loved this country, and he was the most proud American because of what it gave him in terms of raising his family, even though we never had much money. But today in America, we are the only major country on earth that doesnt guarantee health care to all people, that doesnt guarantee paid family and medical leave. We have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth. We are seeing millions of families unable to send their kids to college in the United States of America.Im running for president because I believe it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics. I do believe we need a political revolution where millions of people stand up and say loudly and clearly that our government belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.Thank you all.(APPLAUSE)TODD: Well, there you have it. I promise you, Rachel and I have a lot more questions, but we just dont have any more time, unless we could (inaudible) a third hour, but I dont think so.Our debate coverage  (inaudible) debate coverage will continue in just a moment with our colleague (inaudible).And we want to thank all of you for being here, and we want to thank the two candidates for taking part in this important event.MADDOW: We also want to thank our host, the University of New Hampshire, and the people of New Hampshire. You guys get to vote in just five days. I cant wait to see how it turns out. Dont screw up.TODD: Well see you in a few minutes. Thank you.MADDOW: Thank you.(APPLAUSE)END'

aS'Heres how we analyzed the fifth Democratic debate in real time, and our live fact checks._____With four days until the New Hampshire primary, Senator Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, faced off in their first one-on-one debate of the Democratic primary cycle. These were the highlights: Hillary Clinton used her opening statement to agree with Bernie Sanders about the rigged economy and a corrupt campaign finance system, but she also focused on racism and sexism by saying, how we treat people as opposed to how we want to be treated. She closed with a line that her campaign has been using to try to paint Mr. Sanders as simply an idealist: Im not making promises that I cannot keep, Mrs. Clinton said. The first substantive disagreement between the two candidates was about health care. Mrs. Clinton said Mr. Sanders wanted to scrap the Affordable Care Act and start all over again. Mr. Sanders was quick to respond, saying the idea that he would dismantle the health care law is just not accurate. He said in the future he hoped to rally the American people to achieve health care for all. The two candidates spent a long time debating their progressive credentials. Mrs. Clinton listed positions by Mr. Sanders she didnt think were progressive, like voting against the Brady bill of gun control and accused Mr. Sanders of cherry-picking a quote here or there to describe her as a moderate. Mr. Sanders ended the argument by saying they should not debate definitions but issues. After they debated what it was to be a progressive, the candidates went on to debate what it was to be a part of the establishment. In an effort to show that Mr. Sanders doesnt have the broad support of even the people who know him best, Mrs. Clinton listed all of her supporters and endorsees from Vermont. Mr. Sanders said that those endorsements meant Mrs. Clinton was part of the establishment, and that he represented ordinary Americans. Mrs. Clinton expressed frustration and a direct criticism at Mr. Sanders for his campaign ads that by innuendo, by insinuation, claim Mrs. Clinton has been bought by speaking fees from general interest groups. She called these smears by Mr. Sanders. The complaint walked right into Mr. Sanders stump speech, as he pointed to deregulation of Wall Street following campaign contributions and lobbying, and Republican opposition to climate change legislation to donations from Exxon and the Koch brothers. Mrs. Clinton was asked by the moderators, not by Mr. Sanders, about the speaking fees she took from Wall Street firms. She admitted that she may not have done the job I should in explaining my record, but listed the many billionaires who are attacking her, and said she had a plan on how to stop Wall Street from maintaining its power. A  voter asked Mrs. Clinton a question through the moderator: Will you release the transcripts of your Goldman Sachs speeches, as well as all of your paid speeches? Mrs. Clinton replied: I will look into it. I dont know the status, but I will certainly look into it, while later she pleaded to look at my record when it came to her economic plans. On the question of combating ISIS, both Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton said they agreed with President Obamas plan of arming more Arab and Kurdish forces and providing special forces. Mr. Sanders brought up Mrs. Clintons vote for the Iraq war in 2002, to which Mrs. Clinton replied: A vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat ISIS. We have to look at the threats that we face now. With regards to Iran, Mrs. Clinton accused Mr. Sanders of wanting to normalize relations with Iran. He said he wouldnt do it tomorrow, or any time soon. But he said he kept open the hope to move forward with the country in the future, pointing to recent normalizing of relations with Cuba as an example of reconciling with an enemy. When asked which country  Russia, China or North Korea  posed a bigger security threat, Mr. Sanders said the isolation of North Korea worried him, while Mrs. Clinton saw Russia as a threat for pitting European countries against one another. Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton were in lock step on the issue of veterans affairs, often nodding as the other spoke. Both adamantly said they would never privatize the Department of Veterans Affairs, and criticized Republican votes and efforts by the Koch brothers against veterans aid bills in the Senate. Mrs. Clinton said she was one hundred percent confident that the F.B.I. investigation into her emails would not turn up a single problem. She also criticized the process of retroactive classifications. Mr. Sanders reiterated his commitment to not politicize the issue. Mrs. Clinton said she reluctantly supported the death penalty only in very limited, particularly heinous crimes like terrorism, but disagreed with its use in many states. Mr. Sanders said he would instead lock them up and toss away the key. He concluded: I just dont want to see government be part of killing. As president, Mr. Sanders said he would support trade, despite being against every trade deal over the past 30 years. He said that those were written by corporate America, for corporate America, and that he wanted to protect the American worker. In an amicable moment, Mr. Sanders said, I happen to respect the secretary very much. On our worst days, it is fair to say, we are 100 times better than any Republican candidate. Mrs. Clinton smiled and offered her hand. Mr. Sanders took it, and as they shook hands, the crowd roared. Their closing statements reflected their pitches in brief words. Mrs. Clinton pleaded to bring both your heart and your head to vote on Tuesday, an implicit contrast with Mr. Sanders that he is all heart but unable to get his platform done. Mr. Sanders called for a political revolution.'

aS'Donald J. Trump is grieving.The billionaire businessman initially struck a magnanimous tone after he came in second to Senator Ted Cruz in the Iowa caucuses on Monday night.But for Mr. Trump, a Republican presidential candidate whose campaign is all about winning, the loss was clearly a blow to his brand. And it hurt. Heres an examination of Mr. Trumps five stages of dealing with that defeat.Normally a force on television and social media, Mr. Trump went dark after his loss on Monday night. He avoided the cable news shows the next morning, and his Twitter feed was quiet for more than 15 hours  one of the longest stretches since he announced his campaign in June.When Mr. Trump finally broke his silence, he expressed exasperation at voters for failing to appreciate that he is self-funding his campaign (not exactly true  he has attracted millions in donations). He also could not understand how the news media had failed to grasp that he was always a long shot to win in Iowa, despite his lead in the polls there.Mr. Trump offered congratulations to Mr. Cruz right after the caucuses came to a close, but the graciousness would not last. In a Twitter rant, he assailed the Texas senator for being too long, rambling, overly flamboyant in his victory speech. Mr. Trump tried to tar Mr. Cruz as the 2016 version of Howard The Scream Dean.How come the person who comes in third on many of the networks is being covered like it is one of the great victories in the history of politics in this country? Mr. Trump said.There was much news coverage about the Trump campaigns organizational reach in Iowa over the last few months. Following his inability to win as many votes as Mr. Cruz, Mr. Trump admitted that more focus should have been put on his ground game. But rather than taking personal responsibility, Mr. Trump said he would have invested more if he knew there was a problem.I think, in retrospect, we should have had a better ground game, Mr. Trump said on MSNBCs Morning Joe. I would have funded a better ground game, but people told me our ground game was fine.Almost 36 hours after losing in Iowa, Mr. Trump turned to what is usually the first stage of grief: denial. He accused the Cruz campaign of fraud because it had distributed voter violation fliers to compel people to caucus and because it had told voters, based on a misinterpreted news item, that Ben Carson was quitting the race. The only fair solution, Mr. Trump said, was to void the results and have a new election.'

aS'The debate over widening inequality, and what to do about it, has gradually moved toward the center of the political agenda and fueled populist movements on the left and the right in many nations.But in the United States  where a competitive political campaign requires huge sums of money, and wealth or access to it is increasingly a prerequisite for entry  the debate has become supercharged.Voters in both parties find themselves wondering whether anyone is looking out for the little guy, even as a candidate like Donald J. Trump suggests that it is precisely his wealth that liberates him from the influence of special interests.So it is fair to ask whether a politicians personal bankroll should be taken into account by voters as a predictor of how he or she might lead. A growing body of research has addressed the extent to which wealth, behavior and policy are linked.Although there are always exceptions, the research generally confirms what many voters perhaps always intuited: that rich political leaders are not like poor political leaders but with more money; rather, wealth changes people qualitatively.Wealth plays out in the political sphere in all kinds of ways, often personally. Can Hillary Clinton represent the interests of working people when she and her husband have taken so much money from Wall Street? Was Mitt Romneys private-equity business too ruthless with workers?But the bigger question is whether money predicts where leaders will come down on policy.The study perhaps most relevant to the relationship between wealth and political behavior is one that looked at whether the wealth of members of Congress predicted their support for legislation affecting inequality.As it is, the typical lawmaker is dozens of times richer than the typical American. But even within Congress, the researchers Michael W. Kraus and Bennett Callaghan found, relative wealth matters  if youre a Democrat.Republicans across the board support policies such as lowering taxes on the rich or reducing business regulation, the authors of the study found. But among Democrats, wealthy lawmakers were more likely to think like Republicans in this regard, while poorer lawmakers were more likely to support such policies as raising the minimum wage or forgiving student debt.Beyond politics and policy, the research also suggests that wealth makes the rich feel, reason, choose and perceive differently from the less privileged.One study examined peoples propensity to break rules  in this case, driving rules. Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Toronto examined what kind of drivers violated laws at intersections in California.They found that drivers of luxury vehicles cut off other drivers about 30 percent of the time and cut off pedestrians roughly 45 percent of the time  compared with about 8 percent and 0 percent for drivers of the humblest vehicles.Their conclusion: The common assumption that resource scarcity fuels most unethical behavior may need updating; the freedom and self-orientation conferred by high status may be far more combustible.Other studies have shown that wealth makes it harder for people to read other peoples emotional cues and to be affected by their pain.One study examining mock job interviews  led by Dr. Kraus at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign  found that poorer people were more accurate in judging the specific emotions (e.g., contempt, sympathy) of their partner relative to upper-class participants.In a related study cited by Dr. Kraus, students from upper- and lower-class families were shown a video of distress and suffering, and a neutral control video.The sad video reduced the heart rate of the poorer students  a response associated with fellow feeling  while the heartbeats of the richer students remained consistent.Of course, in the life of any politician, personal wealth is just one factor among many. Perhaps religion offers an apt analogy. Many candidates will tell you their faith shapes how they see the world and how they choose to act  though none will say it is all controlling. Perhaps wealth should be seen in the same vein, though candidates may be less likely to bring it up.'

aS'Following is a transcript of the Democratic debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.HOLT: Good evening and welcome to the NBC News Youtube Democratic candidates debate. After all the campaigning, soon, Americans will have their say with the first votes of the 2016 campaign just 15 days away in Iowa.HOLT: And New Hampshire not far behind.Tonight will be the final opportunity to see these candidates face to face before the voting begins. Our purpose here tonight is to highlight and examine the differences among the three Democratic candidates. So lets get started.Please welcome Secretary Hillary Clinton, Senator Bernie Sanders and Governor Martin OMalley.(APPLAUSE)Well, welcome to all of you. Hope youre excited, were excited. We want to thank our hosts, the Congressional Black Caucus Institute. Im joined by my colleague Andrea Mitchell tonight. The rules are simple. Sixty seconds for answers, 30 seconds for follow-ups or rebuttals. I know youll all keep exactly to time, so our job should be pretty easy here tonight. Well have questions from the Youtube community throughout the debate.This is a critical point in the race. Youve been defining your differences with each other especially vigorously in the last week on the campaign trail. Were here to facilitate this conversation on behalf of the voters so that they know exactly where you stand as you face off tonight. Lets have a great debate.Well begin with 45 second opening statements from each candidate, starting with Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Well, good evening. And I want to thank the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and the people of Charleston for hosting us here on the eve of Martin Luther King Day tomorrow.You know, I remember well when my youth minister took me to hear Dr. King. I was a teenager. And his moral clarity, the message that he conveyed that evening really stayed with me and helped to set me on a path to service. I also remember that he spent the last day of his life in Memphis, fighting for dignity and higher pay for working people.And that is our fight still. We have to get the economy working and incomes rising for everyone, including those who have been left out and left behind. We have to keep our communities and our country safe. We need a president who can do all aspects of the job.I understand that this is the hardest job in the world. Im prepared and ready to take it on and I hope to earn your support to be the nominee of the Democratic Party and the next president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Thank you. Senator Sanders, your opening statement, sir.SANDERS: Thank you. As we honor the extraordinary life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., its important not only that we remember what he stood for, but that we pledge to continue his vision to transform our country. As we look out at our country today, what the American people understand is we have an economy thats rigged, that ordinary Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, 47 million people living in poverty, and almost all of the new income and wealth going to the top one percent.SANDERS: And then, to make a bad situation worse, we have a corrupt campaign finance system where millionaires and billionaires are spending extraordinary amounts of money to buy elections.This campaign is about a political revolution to not only elect the president, but to transform this country.HOLT: Senator, thank you.(APPLAUSE)And Governor OMalley, your opening statement, sir.OMALLEY: Thank you. My name is Martin OMalley, I was born the year Dr. King delivered his I Have A Dream speech.And I want to thank the people of South Carolina, not only for hosting our debate here tonight, but also for what you taught all of us in the aftermath of the tragic shooting at Mother Emanuel Church.You taught us, in fact, in keeping with Dr. Kings teaching, that love would have the final word when you took down the Confederate flag from your state house; let go of the past and move forward.Eight years ago, you brought forward a new leader in Barack Obama to save our country from the second Great Depression. And thats what hes done. Our countrys doing better, were creating jobs again.But in order to make good on the promise of equal opportunity and equal justice under the law, and we have urgent work to do, and the voices of anger and fear and division that weve heard coming off of the Republican presidential podiums are pretty loud.We need new leadership. We need to come together as a people and build on the good things that President Obama has done.Thats why Im running for president. I need your help, I ask for your vote, and I look forward to moving our country forward once again.Thank you.HOLT: All right. And Governor, thank you.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: All right, to our first question, now. The first question, Ill be addressing to all of the candidates.President Obama came to office determined to swing for the fences on health care reform. Voters want to know how you would define your presidency? How would you think big? So complete this sentence: in my first 100 days in office, my top three priorities will be  fill in the blank.Senator Sanders.SANDERS: Well, thats what our campaign is about. It is thinking big. It is understanding that in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, we should have health care for every man, woman, and child as a right that we should raise the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour; that we have got to create millions of decent- paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure.So, what my first days are about is bringing America together, to end the decline of the middle class, to tell the wealthiest people in this country that yes, they are going to start paying their fair share of taxes, and that we are going to have a government that works for all of us, and not just big campaign contributors.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Secretary Clinton, same question, my first 100 days in office, my top three priorities will be.CLINTON: I would work quickly to present to the Congress my plans for creating more good jobs in manufacturing, infrastructure, clean and renewable energy, raising the minimum wage, and guaranteeing, finally, equal pay for womens work.I would also...(APPLAUSE)I would also be presenting my plans to build on the Affordable Care Act and to improve it by decreasing the out-of-pocket costs by putting a cap on prescription drug costs; by looking for ways that we can put the prescription drug business and the health insurance company business on a more stable platform that doesnt take too much money out of the pockets of hard-working Americans.And third, I would be working, in every way that I knew, to bring our country together. We do have too much division, too much mean- spiritedness. Theres a lot we have to do on immigration reform, on voting rights, on campaign finance reform, but we need to do it together. Thats how well have the kind of country for the 21st century that we know will guarantee our children and grandchildren the kind of future they deserve.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Governor OMalley, same question.OMALLEY: Thank you. First of all, I would lay out an agenda to make wages go up again for all Americans, rather than down. Equal pay for equal work, making it easier rather than harder for people to join labor unions and bargain collectively for better wages; getting 11 million of our neighbors out of the underground shadow economy by passing comprehensive immigration reform, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, however we can, wherever we can.Secondly, I believe the greatest business opportunity to come to the United States of America in 100 years is climate change. And I put forward a plan to move us to a 100 percent clean electric energy grid by 2050 and create 5 million jobs along the way.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Thank you. Youve all...OMALLEY: Finally  Im sorry, that was second, Lester.OMALLEY: And third and finally, we need a new agenda for Americas cities. We have not had a new agenda for Americas cities since Jimmy Carter. We need a new agenda for America cities that will invest in the talents and skills in our people, that will invest in CBVG transportation, infrastructure and transit options, and make our cities the leading edge in this move to a redesigned built clean green energy future that will employ our people.HOLT: All right governor thank you.Weve all laid out large visions and were going to cover a lot of the ground you talked about as we continue in the evening. The last couple of weeks of this campaign have featured some of the sharpest exchanges in the race. Lets start with one of them, the issue of guns.Senator Sanders, last week Secretary Clinton called you quote, a pretty reliable vote for the gun lobby. Right before the debate you changed your position on immunity from lawsuits for gun manufacturers, can you tell us why?SANDERS: Well, I think Secretary Clinton knows that what she says is very disingenuous. I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA. I was in 1988, there were three candidates running for congress in the state of Vermont, I stood up to the gun lobby and came out and maintained the position that in this country we should not be selling military style assault weapons.I have supported from day one and instant background check to make certain that people who should have guns do not have guns. And that includes people of criminal backgrounds, people who are mentally unstable. I support what President Obama is doing in terms of trying to close the gun show loop holes and I think it should be a federal crime if people act as dormant (ph).We have seen in this city a horrendous tragedy of a crazed person praying with people in the coming up and shooting nine people. This should not be a political issue. What we should be doing is working together.And by the way, as a senator from a rural state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in an excellent position to bring people together to fight the sensible...HOLT: Senator, but you didnt answer the question that you did change your position on immunity from gun manufacturers. So can you...SANDERS: What I have said, is that gun manufacturers liability bill has some good provisions among other things, weve prohibited ammunition that wouldve killed cops who had protection on. We have child safety protection work on guns in that legislation. And what we also said, is a small mom and pop gun shop who sells a gun legally to somebody should not be held liable if somebody does something terrible with that gun.So what I said is,  I would re-look at it. We are going to re- look at it and I will support stronger provisions.HOLT: Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond to Senator Sanders.CLINTON: Yes look, I have made it clear based on Senator Sanders own record that he has voted with the NRA, with the gun lobby numerous times. He voted against the Brady Bill five times. He voted for what we call, the Charleston Loophole. He voted for immunity from gunmakers and sellers which the NRA said, was the most important piece of gun legislation in 20 years. He voted to let guns go onto the Amtrak, guns go into National Parks. He voted against doing research to figure out how we can save lives. Lets not forget what this is about, 90 people a day die from gun violence in our country. Thats 33,000 people a year.One of the most horrific examples not a block from here where we had nine people murdered. Now, I am pleased to hear that Senator Sanders has reversed his position on immunity and I look forward to him joining with those members of congress who have already introduced legislation. There is no other industry in America that was given the total pass that the gun makers and dealers were and that needs to be reversed.HOLT: All right, Governor OMalley, you signed tough gun control measures as governor of Maryland and there are a lot Democrats in the audience here in South Carolina who own guns. This conversation might be worrying many of them. They may be hearing, you want to take my guns. What would you say to them?OMALLEY: This is what I would say Lester, look see, Ive listened to Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders go back and forth on which of them has the most inconsistent record on gun safety legislation and I would have to agree with both of them. Theyve both been inconsistent when it comes to this issue.OMALLEY: Im the one candidate on this stage that actually brought people together to pass comprehensive gun safety legislation. This is very personal to me being from Baltimore. I will never forget one occasion visiting a little boy in Johns Hopkins Hospital, he was getting a birthday haircut, the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery and that boys head was pierced with a bullet. And I remember visiting him, it did not kill him - I remember visiting him and his mother in Johns Hopkins Hospital. He was getting a birthday haircut, the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery, and that boys head was pierced with a bullet.And, I remember visiting him, it did not kill him. I remember visiting him and his mother in Johns Hopkins Hospital. In his diapers (ph) with tubes running in and out of his head, same age as my little boy.So, after the slaughter of the kids in Connecticut last year, we brought people together. We did pass in our state comprehensive gun safety legislation. It did have a ban on combat assault weapons, universal background checks, and you know what? We did not interrupt a single persons hunting season.Ive never met a self respecting deer hunter that needed an AR-15 to down a deer. And, so...(APPLAUSE)... were able to actually do these things.HOLT: Alright, Governor, thank you.Secretary Clinton, this is a community that has suffered a lot of heartache in the last year. Of course, as you mentioned, the church shootings. We wont forget the video of Walter Scott being shot in the back while running from police.We understand that a jury will decide whether that police officer was justified, but it plays straight to the fears of many African American men that their lives are cheap. Is that perception, or in your view, is it reality?CLINTON: Well, sadly its reality, and it has been heartbreaking, and incredibly outraging to see the constant stories of young men like Walter Scott, as you said, who have been killed by police officers. Their needs to be a concerted effort to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.And, that requires a very clear, agenda for retraining police officers, looking at ways to end racial profiling, finding more ways to really bring the disparities that stalk our country into high relief.One out of three African American men may well end up going to prison. Thats the statistic. I want people hear to think what we would be doing if it was one out of three white men, and very often, the black men are arrested, convicted and incarcerated ...(APPLAUSE)...for offensive that do not lead to the same results for white men.So, we have a very serious problem that we can no longer ignore.HOLT: You time is up.Senator Sanders, my next question is...SANDERS: ...Well, I  look...HOLT: ... Its actually  actually my next question is to you...SANDERS: ... Let me respond to what the secretary said. We have a criminal justice system which is broken. Who in America is satisfied that we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth, including China? Disproportionately African American, and Latino. Who is satisfied that 51% of African American young people are either unemployed, or underemployed? Who is satisfied that millions of people have police records for possessing marijuana when the CEOs of Wall Street companies who destroyed our economy have no police records.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Senator Sanders...SANDERS: ... We need to take a very hard look at our...HOLT: Senator. Senator Sanders...SANDERS: ... criminal justice system, investing in jobs, and education not in jails and incarceration .HOLT: ... Just over a week ago the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus endorsed Secretary Clinton, not you. He said that choosing her over you was not a hard decision. In fact, our polling shows shes beating you more than two to one among minority voters. How can you be the nominee if you dont have that support?SANDERS: Well, let me talk about polling.(LAUGHTER) SANDERS: As Secretary Clinton well knows, when this campaign began she was 50 points ahead of me. We were all of three percentage points. Guess what?In Iowa, New Hampshire, the race is very, very close. Maybe were ahead New Hampshire.(CHEERING)SANDERS: In terms of polling, guess what? We are running ahead of Secretary Clinton. In terms of taking on my taking on my good friend, Donald Trump, beating him by 19 points in New Hampshire, 13 points in the last national poll that we saw.To answer your question. When the African American community becomes familiar with my Congressional record and with our agenda, and with our views on the economy, and criminal justice  just as the general population has become more supportive, so will the African American community, so will the Latino community. We have the momentum, were on a path to a victory.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)OMALLEY: Lester, I (inaudible)HOLT: Governor, Im going to come to you in a second.Google searches for the words, Black Lives Matter surpassed, civil rights movement. And, here in South Carolina, black lives matter was the number one trending political issue.HOLT: Governor OMalley, youve campaigned on your record as governor of Maryland, and before that, the mayor of Baltimore. Last year, of course, Baltimore was rocked by violent unrest in the wake of the death of Freddie Gray.And right from the start of your campaign, youve been dogged by those who blame your tough-on-crime, so-called zero tolerance policies as mayor for contributing to that unrest. What responsibility do you bear?OMALLEY: Yes, lets talk about this. When I ran for mayor in 1999, Lester, it was not because our city was doing well. It was because we were burying over 300 young, poor black men every single year.And thats why I ran, because, yes, black lives matter. And we did a number of things. We werent able to make our city immune from setbacks as the Freddie Gray unrest and tragic death showed.But we were able to save a lot of lives doing things that actually worked to improve police and community relations. The truth of the matter is, we created a civilian review board. And many of these things are in the new agenda for criminal justice reform that Ive put forward.We created a civilian review board, gave them their own detectives. We required the reporting of discourtesy, use of excessive force, lethal force. I repealed the possession of marijuana as a crime in our state.I drove our incarceration rate down to 20-year lows, and drove violent crime down to 30-year lows, and became the first governor south of the Mason-Dixon line to repeal the death penalty.I feel a responsibility every day to find things that work...(APPLAUSE)HOLT: All right. Lets talk...OMALLEY: ... and to do more of them to reform our criminal justice system.HOLT: Lets talk more about policing and the criminal justice system. Senator Sanders, a few times tonight were going to hear from some of the most prominent voices on YouTube, starting with Franchesca Ramsey, who tackles racial stereotypes through her videos. Lets watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FRANCHESCA RAMSEY: Hey, Im Franchesca Ramsey. I believe theres a huge conflict of interest when local prosecutors investigate cases of police violence within their own communities.For example, last month, the officers involved in the case of 12- year-old Tamir Rice werent indicted. How would your presidency ensure that incidents of police violence are investigated and prosecuted fairly?(END VIDEO CLIP)HOLT: Senator Sanders.SANDERS: I apologize for not hearing all of that question.HOLT: Would you like me to read it back to you?SANDERS: Yes.HOLT: Prosecutors  I believe theres a huge conflict of interest when local prosecutors investigate cases of police violence within their communities. Most recently, we saw this with a non- indictment of the officers involved in the case of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. How would you presidency ensure incidents of police violence are investigated and prosecuted fairly?SANDERS: Absolutely. This is a responsibility for the U.S. Justice Department to get involved. Whenever anybody in this country is killed while in police custody, it should automatically trigger a U.S. attorney generals investigation.(APPLAUSE)Second of all, and I speak as a mayor who worked very closely and well with police officers, the vast majority of whom are honest, hard- working people trying to do a difficult job, but let us be clear.If a police officer breaks the law, like any public official, that officer must be held accountable.(APPLAUSE)And thirdly, we have got to de-militarize our police departments so they dont look like occupying armies. Weve got to move toward community policing.And fourthly, we have got to make our police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Secretary Clinton, this question is for you. Tonight parts of America are in the grip of a deadly heroin epidemic, spanning race and class, hitting small towns and cities alike. It has become a major issue in this race.In a lot of places where youve been campaigning, despite an estimated trillion dollars spent, many say the war on drugs has failed. So what would you do?CLINTON: Well, Lester, youre right. Everywhere I go to campaign, Im meeting families who are affected by the drug problem that mostly is opioids and heroin now, and lives are being lost and children are being orphaned. And Ive met a lot of grandparents who are now taking care of grandchildren.So I have tried to come out with a comprehensive approach that, number one, does tell the states that we will work with you from the federal government putting more money, about a billion dollars a year, to help states have a different approach to dealing with this epidemic.The policing needs to change. Police officers must be equipped with the antidote to a heroin overdose or an opioid overdose, known as Narcan. They should be able to administer it. So should firefighters and others.We have to move away from treating the use of drugs as a crime and instead, move it to where it belongs, as a health issue. And we need to divert more people from the criminal justice system into drug courts, into treatment, and recovery.HOLT: And thats time. CLINTON: So this is the kind of approach that we should take in dealing with what is now...HOLT: Senator...CLINTON: ... a growing epidemic.HOLT: Senator Sanders, would you like to respond?SANDERS: Sure. I agree...(APPLAUSE)I agree with everything the Secretary said, but let me just add this, there is a responsibility on the part of the pharmaceutical industry and the drug companies who are producing all of these drugs and not looking at the consequence of it.And second of all, when we talk about addiction being a disease, the Secretary is right, what that means is we need a revolution in this country in terms of mental health treatment. People should be able to get the treatment that they need when they need it, not two months from now, which is why I believe in universal...HOLT: Thats...SANDERS: ... healthcare with mental health...HOLT: ... time.SANDERS: ... a part of that.HOLT: Were going to get into all that coming up.OMALLEY (?): Lester, just ten seconds.HOLT: But were going to take a break and we need to take a break...OMALLEY (?): Just 10 seconds. All of the things...HOLT: ... and when we come back, the anger brewing in America.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HOLT: Welcome back to Charleston. Lets turn to another area where there has been fierce disagreement  that would be health care.Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton, you both mentioned it in your 100-day priorities.Lets turn to my colleague, Andrea Mitchell now to lead that questioning.MITCHELL: Thank you, Lester.Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders favors what he calls Medicare for all. Now, you said that what he is proposing would tear up Obamacare and replace it.Secretary Clinton, is it fair to say to say that Bernie Sanders wants to kill Obamacare?CLINTON: Well, Andrea, I am absolutely committed to universal health care. I have worked on this for a long time, people may remember that I took on the health insurance industry back in the 90s, and I didnt quit until we got the childrens health insurance program that ensures eight million kids.And I certainly respect Senator Sanders intentions, but when youre talking about health care, the details really matter. And therefore, we have been raising questions about the nine bills that he introduced over 20 years, as to how they would work and what would be the impact on peoples health care?He didnt like that, his campaign didnt like it either. And tonight, hes come out with a new health care plan. And again, we need to get into the details. But heres what I believe, the Democratic Party and the United States worked since Harry Truman to get the Affordable Care Act passed.We finally have a path to universal health care. We have accomplished so much already. I do not to want see the Republicans repeal it, and I dont to want see us start over again with a contentious debate. I want us to defend and build on the Affordable Care Act and improve it.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: OK.MITCHELL: Senator Sanders?SANDERS: Secretary  Secretary Clinton didnt answer your question.(LAUGHTER)Because what her campaign was saying  Bernie Sanders, who has fought for universal health care for my entire life, he wants to end Medicare, end Medicaid, end the childrens health insurance program. That is nonsense.What a Medicare-for-all program does is finally provide in this country health care for every man, woman and child as a right. Now, the truth is, that Frank Delano Roosevelt, Harry Truman, do you know what they believed in? They believed that health care should be available to all of our people.Im on the committee that wrote the Affordable Care Act. I made the Affordable Care Act along with Jim Clyburn a better piece of legislation. I voted for it, but right now, what we have to deal with is the fact that 29 million people still have no health insurance. We are paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, getting ripped off.And heres the important point, we are spending far more per person on health care than the people of any other country. My proposal, provide health care to all people, get private insurance out of health insurance, lower the cost of health care for middle class families by 5,000 bucks.Thats the vision we need to take.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: But  Senator Sanders, if I can...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, I have to say Im not sure whether were talking about the plan you just introduced tonight, or were talking about the plan you introduced nine times in the Congress. But the fact is, we have the Affordable Care Act. That is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country.(APPLAUSE)And we have already seen 19 million Americans get insurance. We have seen the end of pre-existing conditions keeping people from getting insurance.(APPLAUSE)We have seen women no longer paying more for our insurance than men. And we have seen young people, up to the age of 26, being able to stay on their parents policy.SANDERS: But  what if we have...CLINTON: Now, there are things we can do to improve it, but to tear it up and start over again, pushing our country back into that kind of a contentious debate, I think is the wrong direction.SANDERS: It is  it is absolutely inaccurate.OMALLEY: I have to talk about something thats actually working in our state.MITCHELL: Governor  Governor Sanders...SANDERS: No one is tearing this up, were going to go forward. But with the secretary neglected to mention, not just the 29 million still have no health insurance, that even more are underinsured with huge copayments and deductibles.Tell me why we are spending almost three times more than the British, who guarantee health care to all of their people? Fifty percent more than the French, more than the Canadians. The vision from FDR and Harry Truman was health care for all people as a right in a cost-effective way.Were not going to tear up the Affordable Care Act. I helped write it. But we are going to move on top of that to a Medicaid-for- all system.OMALLEY: Andrea  Andrea  Andrea.(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)OMALLEY: Instead of  Andrea, I think, instead of attacking one another on health care, we should be talking about the things that are actually working.In our state, we have moved to an all-payer system. With the Affordable Care Act, we now have moved all of our acute care hospitals, that driver of cost at the center, away from fee-for- service.And actually to pay, we pay them based on how well they keep patients out of the hospital. How well they keep their patients. Thats the future. We need to build on the Affordable Care Act, do the things that work, and reduce costs and increase access.(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: And thats exactly what we are able to do based on the foundation of the Affordable Care Act  what Governor OMalley just said is one of the models that we will be looking at to make sure we do get costs down, we do limit a lot of the unnecessary costs that we still have in the system.But, with all due respect, to start over again with a whole new debate is something that I think would set us back. The Republicans just voted last week to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and thank goodness, President Obama vetoed it and saved Obamacare for the American people.(APPLAUSE)MITCHELL: Senator Sanders, let me ask you this, though...SANDERS: Yeah.MITCHELL: ... youve talked about Medicare for all...SANDERS: Yes.MITCHELL: .. and tonight youve released a very detailed plan, just two... SANDERS: Not all that detailed.MITCHELL: ... well, two hours before the debate, you did.SANDERS: Well.MITCHELL: But let me ask you about Vermont. Because in Vermont  you tried in the state of Vermont, and Vermont walked away from this kind of idea, of  of Medicare for all, single-payer, because they concluded it would require major tax increases...SANDERS: Well, thats  you might want to ask...MITCHELL: ... and by some estimates, it would double the budget. If you couldnt sell it in Vermont, Senator...SANDERS: Andrea, let me just say this.MITCHELL: ... how can you sell it to the country?SANDERS: Let me just say that you might want to ask the governor of the state of Vermont why he could not do it. Im not the governor. Im the senator from the state of Vermont.(LAUGHTER)But second of all  second of all...(APPLAUSE)... here is what the real point is, in terms of all of the issues youve raised  the good questions youve raised. You know what it all comes down to?Do you know why we cant do what every other country  major country on Earth is doing? Its because we have a campaign finance system that is corrupt, we have super PACs, we have the pharmaceutical industry pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into campaign contributions and lobbying, and the private insurance companies as well.What this is really about is not the rational way to go forward  its Medicare for all  it is whether we have the guts to stand up to the private insurance companies and all of their money, and the pharmaceutical industry. Thats what this debate should be about.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well, as someone who  as someone who has a little bit of experience standing up to the health insurance industry, that spent, you know...(APPLAUSE)... many, many millions of dollars attacking me, and probably will so again, because of what I believe we can do building on the Affordable Care Act, I think its important to point out that there are a lot of reasons we have the health care system we have today.I know how much money influences the political decision-making. Thats why Im for huge campaign finance reform. However, we started a system that had private health insurance.And even during the Affordable Care Act debate, there was an opportunity to vote for what was called the public option. In other words, people could buy in to Medicare, and even when the Democrats were in charge of the Congress, we couldnt get the votes for that.So, what Im saying is really simple. This has been the fight of the Democratic Party for decades. We have the Affordable Care Act. Lets make it work.Lets take the models that states are doing. We now have driven costs down to the lowest theyve been in 50 years. Now weve got to get individual costs down. Thats what Im planning to do.HOLT: And thats time (ph). Were gonna take a turn now.Secretary Clinton, in his final State of the Union address, President Obama said his biggest regret was his inability to bring the country together. If President Obama couldnt do it, how will you?OMALLEY: Great question.CLINTON: Well, I think its an important point the president made in his State of the Union. And heres what I would say. I will go anywhere, to meet with anyone, at any time to find common ground.Thats what I did as a first lady, when I worked with both Democrats and Republicans to get the Childrens Health Insurance Program, when I worked with Tom DeLay, one of the most partisan of Republicans, to reform the adoption and foster care system.What I did, working in the Senate, where I crossed the aisle often, working even with the senator from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, to get Tricare for national guardsmen and women.And its what I did as Secretary of State, on numerous occasions, and most particularly, rounding up two-thirds votes in order to pass a treaty that lowered the nuclear weapons in both Russia and the United States. CLINTON: So I know its hard, but I also know youve got to work at it every single day. I look out here, I see a lot of my friends from the Congress. And I know that they work at it every single day.Because maybe you cant only find a little sliver of common ground to cooperate with somebody from the other party, but who knows. If youre successful there, maybe you can build even more. Thats what I would do.HOLT: Thats time. Senator Sanders, response.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: A couple of years ago, when we understood that veterans were not getting the quality care they needed in the timely manner, I worked with folks like John McCain and others to pass the most comprehensive veterans health care legislation in modern history.But let me rephrase your question because I think, in all do respect, youre expression. In all do respect, youre missing the main point. And the main point in the Congress, its not the Republicans and Democrats hate each other.Thats a mythology from the media. The real issue is that Congress is owned by big money and refuses to do what the American people want them to do.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: The real issue is that in area after area, raising the minimum wage to $15 bucks an hour. The American people want it. Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, creating 13 million jobs, the American people want it. The pay equity for women, the American people want it. Demanding that the wealthy start paying their fair share of taxes. The American people want it.HOLT: Thats time. But let me continue with the...SANDERS: The point is, we have to make Congress respond to the needs of the people, not big money.HOLT: Senator Sanders, let me continue, you call yourself a Democratic socialist...SANDERS: I do. HOLT: And throughout your career in politics, youve been critical of the Democratic party, youve been saying in a book you wrote, quote, There wasnt a hell of a big difference between the the two major parties. How would you will a general election...SANDERS: Did I say that?HOLT: How will you win a general election labeling yourself a democratic socialist?SANDERS: Because of what I believe in what I was just saying. The Democratic party needs major reform. To those of you in South Carolina, you know what, in Mississippi, we need a 50-state strategy so that people in South Carolina and Mississippi can get the resources that they need.Instead of being dependent on super PACs, what we need is to be dependent on small, individual campaign contributors. We need an agenda that speaks to the needs of working families and low-income people. Not wealthy campaign contributors.HOLT: Yes, but senator, you can...SANDERS: We need to expand what the input into the Democratic party. I am very proud that in this campaign, we have seen an enormous amount of excitement from young people, from working people. We have received more individual contributions than any candidate in the history of this country up to this point.(APPLAUSE)OMALLEY: Yes, but senator you never came to campaign for Vincent Sheheen when he was running for governor. In fact, neither of you came to campaign for Vincent Sheheen when he was running for governor.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: We can talk all we want about wanting to build a stronger Democratic party, but Lester, the question you answered, its no laughing matter.The most recurring question I get when I stand on the chair all across Iowa and talk with my neighbors is, how are you going to heal the divisions and the wounds in our country? This is the biggest challenge we face as a people.All my life, I brought people together over deep divides and very old wounds, and thats what we need now in a new leader. We cannot keep talking past each other, declaring all Republicans are our enemies or the war is all about being against millionaires or billionaires, or its all against American Muslims, all against immigrants.Look, as Frederick Douglas said, we are one, our cause is one, and we must help each other if we are going to succeed. HOLT: And that is right.SANDERS: And I respectfully disagree.HOLT: Secretary Clinton, our next question is for you. Heres another quantitative problem.SANDERS: And I respectfully disagree with my friend over here. And that is, you are right. All of us have denounced Trumps attempts to divide this country: the anti-Latino rhetoric, the racist rhetoric, he anti-Muslim rhetoric.But where I disagree with you, Governor OMalley, is I do believe we have to deal with the fundamental issues of a handful of billionaires...OMALLEY: I agree with that.SANDERS: ... who control economic and political life of this country.OMALLEY: I agree.SANDERS: Nothing real will get happened. Unless we have a political revolution. Where millions of people finally stand up.HOLT: And were going to get into that coming up. But Secretary Clinton, heres a question from YouTube. Its from a young video blogger who has over 5 million subscribers. He has a question about the importance of younger voters.FRANTA: Hi, Im Connor Franta, Im 23 and my audience is around the same age. Getting my generation to vote should be a priority for any presidential candidate.Now I know Senator Sanders is pretty popular among my peers, but what I want to know is, how are all of you planning on engaging us further in this election?HOLT: Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Well thanks for the question and congratulations on five million viewers on YouTube, thats quite an accomplishment. Look, this election is mostly about the future and therefore it is of greatest urgency for young people.Ive laid out my ideas about what we can do to make college affordable; how we can help people pay off their student debts and save thousands of dollars, how we can create more good jobs because a lot of the young people that I talk with are pretty disappointed the economic prospects they feel their facing. So making community college free, making it possible to attend a public college or university with debt free tuition, looking for ways to protect our rights especially from the concerted Republican assault; on voting rights, on womens rights, on gay rights, on civil rights, on workers rights.And I know how much young people value their independence, their autonomy, and their rights. So I think this is an election where we have to pull young people and older people together to have a strategy about how were going to encourage even more Americans to vote because it absolutely clear to me...HOLT: Thats time...CLINTON: That turning over our White House to the Republicans would be bad for everybody especially young people.HOLT: A quick follow up  a thirty second follow up.Why is Senator Sanders beating you to 2 to 1 among younger votes?CLINTON: Look, I have the greatest respect for Senator Sanders and for his supports and Im going to keep working as hard as I can to reach as many people of all ages about what I will do, what the experience and the ideas that I have that I will bring to the White House and I hope to have their support when Im the Democratic nominee.HOLT: Were going to take...SANDERS: Is that your strategy...HOLT: Were going to take a break. When we come back; big banks, big business and big differences among the three candidates on the American Economy. Well be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HOLT: Welcome back from Charleston. Lets turn now to the economy.Senator Sanders, you released a tough new ad last week in which without mentioning Secretary Clinton by name, you talk about two Democratic visions for regulating Wall Street. One says its OK to take millions from big banks and tell them what to do. My plan, break up the big banks, close the tax loopholes and make them pay their fair share.What do you see as the difference between what you would do about the banks and what Secretary Clinton would do?SANDERS: Well, the first difference is I dont take money from big banks. I dont get personal speaking fees from Goldman Sachs. What I would do...(APPLAUSE)What I would do is understand that when you have three out of the four largest banks today, bigger than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have the six largest financial institutions having assets of 60 percent of the GDP of America, it is very clear to me what you have to do.Youve got to bring back the 21st century Glass-Steagall legislation and youve got to break up these huge financial institutions. They have too much economic power and they have too much financial power over our entire economy. If Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, the old Republican trust buster, what he would say is these guys are too powerful. Break them up. I believe thats what the American people to want see. Thats my view.HOLT: Secretary Clinton, help the voter understand the daylight between the two of you here.CLINTON: Well, theres no daylight on the basic premise that there should be no bank too big to fail and no individual too powerful to jail. We agree on that. But where we disagree is the comments that Senator Sanders has made that dont just affect me, I can take that, but hes criticized President Obama for taking donations from Wall Street, and President Obama has led our country out of the great recession. Senator Sanders called him weak, disappointing. He even, in 2011, publicly sought someone to run in a primary against President Obama. Now, I personally believe that President Obamas work to push through the Dodd-Frank...(LAUGHTER)The Dodd-Frank bill and then to sign it was one of the most important regulatory schemes weve had since the 1930s. So Im going to defend Dodd-Frank and Im going to defend President Obama for taking on Wall Street, taking on the financial industry and getting results.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: OK. First of all...HOLT: Senator Sanders, your response.SANDERS: Set the record right. In 2006 when I ran for the Senate, Senator Barack Obama was kind enough to campaign for me, 2008, I did my best to see that he was elected and in 2012, I worked as hard as I could to see that he was reelected. He and I are friends. Weve worked together on many issues. We have some differences of opinion.But here is the issue, Secretary touched on it, can you really reform Wall Street when they are spending millions and millions of dollars on campaign contributions and when they are providing speaker fees to individuals? So its easy to say, well, Im going to do this and do that, but I have doubts when people receive huge amounts of money from Wall Street. SANDERS: I am very proud, I do not have a super PAC. I do not want Wall Streets money. Ill rely on the middle class and working families...HOLT: Thats time.Governor OMalley...(CROSSTALK)SANDERS: ... campaign contributions.HOLT: I have a question for you...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, I think since  since Senator Standers followed up on this...HOLT: Thirty-second response.CLINTON: Your profusion of comments about your feelings towards President Obama are a little strange given what you said about him in 2011.But look, I have a plan that most commentators have said is tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive.OMALLEY: Thats not true.CLINTON: It builds on the Dodd-Frank  yes, it is. It builds on the Dodd-Frank, regulatory scheme...OMALLEY: Its just not true.CLINTON: ... but it goes much further, because...OMALLEY: Oh, come on.CLINTON: ... both the governor and the senator have focused only on the big banks. Lehman Brothers, AIG, the shadow banking sector were as big a problem in what caused the Great Recession, I go after them.And I can tell you that the hedge fund billionaires who are running ads against me right now, and Karl Rove, who started running an ad against me right now, funded by money from the financial services sector, sure thing, Im the one they dont want to be up against.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Governor OMalley.OMALLEY: Yes, thank you. Yes, Lester, what Secretary Clinton just said is actually not true. What  I have put forward a plan that would actually put cops back on the beat of Wall Street. I have put forward a plan that was heralded as very comprehensive and realistic.Look, if a bank robber robs a bank and all you do is slap him on the wrist, hes just going to keep robbing banks again. The same thing is true with people in suits.Secretary Clinton, I have a tremendous amount of respect for you, but for you to say theres no daylight on this between the three of us is also not true. I support reinstituting a modern version of Glass- Steagall that would include going after the shadow banks, requiring capital requirements that would force them to no longer put us on the hook for these sorts of things.In prior debates Ive heard you even bring up  I mean, now you bring up President Obama here in South Carolina in defense of the fact of your cozy relationship with Wall Street.In an earlier debate, I heard you bring up even the 9/11 victims to defend it. The truth of the matter is, Secretary Clinton, you do not go as far as reining in Wall Street as I would.And the fact of the matter is, the people of America deserve to have a president thats on their side, protecting the main street economy from excesses on Wall Street. And were just as vulnerable today.HOLT: Secretary Clinton, 30-second response.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Yes, well, first of all  first of all, Paul Krugman, Barney Frank, others have all endorsed my plan. Secondly, we have Dodd-Frank. It gives us the authority already to break up big banks that pose...OMALLEY: And we have never used it.CLINTON: That pose a risk to the financial sector. I want to go further and add to that.And, you know, Governor, you have raised money on Wall Street. You raised a lot of money on Wall Street when you were the head of the Democratic Governors Association...OMALLEY: Yes, but I havent gotten a penny this year... CLINTON: And you were...OMALLEY: ... so somebody please, go on to martinomalley.com...(LAUGHTER)OMALLEY: Go on to martinomalley.com, send me your checks. Theyre not giving me  zero.CLINTON: Yes, well, the point is that if were going to be serious about this and not just try to score political points, we should know whats in Dodd-Frank, and whats in Dodd-Frank already gives the president the authority...(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: ... with his regulators to make those decisions.SANDERS: Let me give you an example of how corrupt  how corrupt this system is. Goldman Sachs recently fined $5 billion. Goldman Sachs has given this country two secretaries of treasury, one on the Republicans, one under Democrats.OMALLEY: Say it.SANDERS: The leader of Goldman Sachs is a billionaire who comes to Congress and tells us we should cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.Secretary Clinton  and youre not the only one, so I dont mean to just point the finger at you, youve received over $600,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs in one year.I find it very strange that a major financial institution that pays $5 billion in fines for breaking the law, not one of their executives is prosecuted, while kids who smoke marijuana get a jail sentence.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Thats time.Andrea.CLINTON: Well, the last point on this is, Senator Sanders, youre the only one on this stage that voted to deregulate the financial market in 2000, to take the cops off the street, to use Governor OMalleys phrase, to make the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission no longer able to regulate swaps and derivatives, which were one of the main cause of the collapse in 08.So theres plenty...SANDERS: If you want to...CLINTON: Theres plenty of problems that we all have to face together.And the final thing I would say, were at least having a vigorous debate about reining in Wall Street...HOLT: ... Senator...CLINTON: ... The Republicans want to give them more power, and repeal Dodd-Frank. Thats what we need to stop...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Anyone who wants to check my record in taking on Wall Street, in fighting against the deregulation of Wall Street when Wall Street put billions of dollars in lobbying, in campaign contributions to get the government off their backs. They got the government off their backs.Turns out that they were crooks, and they destroyed our economy. I think its time to put the government back on their backs.(APPLAUSE)MITCHELL: Senator Sanders  Senator Sanders, youve talked a lot about things you want to do. You want free education for everyone, you want the Federal Minimum Wage raised to $15 an hour. You want to expand Social Security...SANDERS: ... Yeah...MITCHELL: ... benefits. Youve been specific about what you want, but lets talk about how to pay for all this. You now said that you would raise taxes today, two hours or so ago, you said you would raise taxes to pay for your health care plan. You havent been specific about how to pay for the other things...SANDERS: ... Thats true.MITCHELL: ... Will you tell us tonight?SANDERS: Good. Youre right. I want to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, create 13 million jobs. We do that by doing away with the absurd loophole that now allows major profitable corporations to stash their money in the Cayman (ph) Islands, and not in some years, pay a nickel in taxes. Yes, I do. I plead guilty. I want every kid in this country who has the ability to be able to go to a public college, or university, tuition free. And, by the way, I want to substantially lower student debt interest rates in this country as well.How do I pay for it?(APPLAUSE)I pay for it through a tax on Wall Street speculation. This country, and the middle class, bailed out Wall Street. Now, it is Wall Streets time to help the middle class. In fact...OMALLEY: (inaudible)SANDERS: ... we have documented, unlike Secretary Clinton, I have documented exactly how I would pay for our ambitious agenda.OMALLEY: Andrea...MITCHELL: ... OK...OMALLEY: ... The only person on this stage who has...MITCHELL: ... Secretary Clinton, you mentioned earlier  Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?CLINTON: Well, I have actually documented every way that Im going to pay for what Im doing because I think the American public deserves to know. And, you can go to my website and actually see that.But, there are serious questions about how were going to pay for what we want to see our country do. And, Im the only candidate standing here tonight who has said I will not raise taxes on the middle class. I want to raise incomes, not taxes, and Im going to do everything I can to make sure that the wealthy pay for debt free tuition, for child care, for paid family leave. To help us bring down student debt were going to refinance that student debt, saving kids thousands of dollars.Yeah, and that will also come out of the  some of the pockets of people in the financial services industry...MITCHELL: OK, were out of time. Senator Sanders,CLINTON: But I will tell you exactly how I pay for everything Ive proposed...(CROSSTALK)MITCHELL: Senator Sanders...SANDERS: ... Here is the main two points...MITCHELL: ... Senator Sanders, let me ask you a question about taxes. SANDERS: Yeah.MITCHELL: The most googled political issue...SANDERS: ... I got it.MITCHELL: In the last month was taxes. Now, in your healthcare plan, the plan you released tonight, you would not only raise taxes on the wealthy, but the details you released indicate you would raise taxes on the middle class also. Is that correct?SANDERS: What is correct, and Im disappointed that Secretary Clintons campaign has made this criticism. Its a Republican criticism. Secretary Clinton does know a lot about healthcare, and she understands, I believe, that a medicare for all, single payer program will substantially lower the cost of healthcare for middle class families. So, what we have got to acknowledge, and I hope the Secretary does, is we are doing away with private health insurance premiums.So, instead of paying $10,000 dollars to Blue Cross, or Blue Shield, yes, some middle class families would be paying slightly more in taxes, but the result would be that that middle class family would be saving some $5,000 dollars in healthcare costs. A little bit more in taxes, do away with private health insurance premiums. Its a pretty good deal.(APPLAUSE)MITCHELL: Senator  Senator, let me just follow up on that.SANDERS: Yeah.MITCHELL: On Meet the Press on December 20th, you said that you would only raise taxes on the middle class to pay for family leave. And, having said that, now you say youre going to raise middle class taxes to pay for healthcare as well. Is that breaking your word?SANDERS: No, it is not breaking my word. When you are  its one thing to say Im raising taxes, its another thing to say that we are doing away with private health insurance premiums.SANDERS: So, if I save you $10,000 in private health insurance, and you pay a little bit more in taxes in total, there are huge savings in what your family is spending.OMALLEY: Senator, Im the only person on this stage thats actually balanced a budget every year for 15 years.SANDERS: I was mayor for eight years, I did that as well.(LAUGHTER)OMALLEY: OK. So, that was eight years. Yes. And Senator, but I actually did it during a budget down time  I mean, during a recession.And Andrea, the  I had to make more cuts than any governor in the history of Maryland, but we invested more in infrastructure, more in transportation. We made our public schools more in America more than five years in a row, and went four years in a row without a pennys increase to college tuition.The things that we need to do in our country, like debt-free college in the next five years, like making universal  like making national service a universal option in order to cut youth unemployment in half in the next three years, all these things can be done if we eliminate one entitlement we can no longer afford as a nation.And that is the wealthy among us, those making more than a million dollars, feel that they are entitled to paying a much lower marginal tax rate than was usual for the better part of these 80 years.And if we tax earnings from investments on money  namely capital gains  at the same rate as we tax sweat and hard work and toil, we can make the investments we need to make to make our country better.HOLT: We have got a lot to ground to cover here.Many Democratic voters are passionate about the need to do something to combat the threat of climate change, including the team of scientists from Youtubes MinuteEarth channel.Heres their take.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANNOUNCER: Hello from MinuteEarth. Fossil fuels have long kept our cars moving and our light bulbs lit.But we know that burning these fuels releases heat-trapping gases that are warming the planet, causing seas to rise and contributing to extreme weather events, like South Carolinas devastating flooding last year.Fighting human-caused climate change means giving up our global addiction to fossil fuels and shifting the bulk of the worlds energy supply to alternative sources.Some countries have acted decisively to make this transition. But here at home, we still get a whooping 82 percent of our energy from coal, oil, and natural gas.In the U.S., political gridlock, pressure from industry lobbyists and insufficient R&D; have made an already tough battle against climate change even tougher.(END VIDEO CLIP)HOLT: Senator Sanders, Americans love their SUVs, which spiked in sales last year as gas prices plummeted.How do you convince Americans that the problem of climate change is so urgent that they need to change their behavior?SANDERS: I think we already are. Younger generation understands it instinctively.I was home in Burlington, Vermont, on Christmas Eve, the temperature was 65 degrees. People in Vermont know whats going on. People who did ice fishing, where their ice is no longer there on the lake understand whats going on.Im on both the Environmental and Energy Committees. The debate is over. Climate change is real. It is already causing major problems. And if we do not act boldly and decisively, a bad situation will become worse.It is amazing to me, and I think well have agreement on this up here, that we have a major party, called the Republican Party that is so owned by the fossil fuel industry and their campaign contributions that they dont even have the courage, the decency to listen to the scientists.(APPLAUSE)It is beyond my comprehension how we can elect a president of the United States, somebody like Trump, who believes that climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese.(LAUGHTER)Bottom line is, we need to be bold and decisive, we can create millions of jobs. We must, for the sake of our kids and grandchildren, transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.Ive got the most comprehensive legislation in the Senate to do that. And as president, I will fight to make that happen.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Governor OMalley, 30 seconds.OMALLEY: Thank you.Lester, on this stage tonight, this Democratic stage, where we actually believe in science.(LAUGHTER)I would like to challenge and invite my colleagues here on this stage to join me in putting forward a plan to move us to a 100 percent clean, electric energy grid by 2050. It can be done.(APPLAUSE)With solar, with wind, with new technologies, with green buildings, this can happen, but in all  President Obama made us more energy independent, but in all of the above strategy didnt land us on the moon, we need American ingenuity and we need to reach by 2050 for the sake of our kids.HOLT: Thats time. Were going to take a break.CLINTON: And let me...HOLT: When we return, the late-breaking developments regarding Iran. The threat of ISIS now more real than ever on U.S. soil. Americans in fear and hearing few good answers.Well be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)TODD: And we are back. Im Chuck Todd. We are just past the halfway mark in our NBC News YouTube Democratic Candidates Debate. Boy, this is one that has actually lived up to the billing.Weve seen some sharp exchanges on guns, health care and Wall Street  the debate, you could argue, that has been largely focused on all things Bernie Sanders.He was on the defensive early, Hillary Clinton getting, I think, some control on the gun issue. But on health care and on Wall Street reform, it was Hillary Clinton on the defensive, and was a very aggressive Bernie Sanders.One thing of note here: Bernie Sanders very much being the sort of revolutionary candidate, major change, and youve heard a lot of Hillary Clinton saying things like she wants to build on the things that President Obama did, wrapping herself in President Obama.Lets go back downstairs and check in with our moderators, Lester and Andrea. So whats coming up next, guys?HOLT: Well, weve covered a lot of ground already, but were gonna be talking about ISIS. A threat to America, its  always polls as one of the top concerns of Americans. And also some more late-breaking news.MITCHELL: We have all the news that has happened from Iran and the presidents comments today, as well as what this means going forward for the War on Terror. What do we expect from Iran, and also whats happening in Syria? So a lot of foreign policy coming up.HOLT: A lot of debate to come. Well be back in Charleston after this.TODD: Youve got it. Well, its the commander-in-chief test  thats whats next. Stay with us  the debate resumes right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HOLT: Charleston, Andrea Mitchell has questions now starting with Iran.MITCHELL: Thank you Lester.Senator Sanders, the nuclear deal is now enforced. Iran is getting its billions of dollars, several Americans who have been held are now going to be heading home. The president said today, its a good day. Its a good day for diplomacy. Its a time now to restore diplomatic relations for the first time since 1979 and actually re- opened a U.S. Embassy in Tehran.SANDERS: I think what weve got to do is move as aggressively as we can to normalize relations with Iran. Understanding that Irans behavior in so many ways is something that we disagree with; their support terrorism, the anti-American rhetoric that were hearing from of their leadership is something that is not acceptable.On the other hand, the fact that weve managed to reach an agreement, something that Ive very strongly supported that prevents Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and we did that without going to war. And that I believe were seeing a fall in our relationships with Iran is a very positive step. So if your question is, do I want to see that relationship become more positive in the future? Yes.Can I tell that we should open an embassy in Tehran tomorrow? No, I dont think we should. But I think the goal has go to be as weve done with Cuba, to move in warm relations with a very powerful and important country in this world.MITCHELL: Your response Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, Im very proud of the Iran Nuclear Agreement. I was very pleased to be part of what the president put into action when he took office. I was responsible for getting those sanctions imposed which put the pressure on Iran. It brought them to the negotiating table which resulted in this agreement.And so, they have been so far, following their requirements under the agreement. But I think we still have to carefully watch them. Weve had one good day over 36 year and I think we need more good days before we move more rapidly toward any kind of normalization. And we have to be sure that they are truly going to implement the agreement. And then, we have to go after them on a lot of their other bad behavior in the region which is causing enormous problems in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and elsewhere.MITCHELL: You mentioned Syria. Let me ask you about Syria, all of you. Lets turn to Syria and the civil war that has been raging there. Are there any circumstances in which you could see deploying significant numbers of ground forces in Syria, not just specials forces but significant ground forces to combat ISIS in a direct combat role?Let me start with you Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Absolutely not.I have a three point plan that does not include American Ground forces. It includes the United States leading an air coalition which is what were doing, supporting fighters on the ground; the Iraqi Army which is beginning to show more ability, the Sunni fighters that we are now helping to reconstitute and Kurdish on both sides of the border.I think we also have try to disrupt their supply chain of foreign fighters and foreign money and we do have to contest them in online space. So Im very committed to both going after ISIS but also supporting what Secretary Kerry is doing to try to move on a political diplomatic to try to begin to slow down and hopefully end the carnage in Syria which is the root of so many of the problems that we seen in the region and beyond.MITCHELL: Senator Sanders, ground forces yes or no? SANDERS: As everybody you know, this is incredibly complicated and difficult issue and I applaud. I know President Obamas been getting a lot of criticism on this. I think he is doing the right thing.What the nightmare is, which many of my Republican colleagues appear to want is to not have learned the lesson of Iraq. To get American young men and women involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of Syria and the Middle East would be an unmitigated disaster that as president, I will do everything in my power to avoid.OMALLEY: Andrea...MITCHELL: Governor OMalley?SANDERS: We should  we should learn  we should learn from King Abdullah of Jordan, one of the few heroes in a very unheroic place. And what Abdullah said is this is a war with a soul of Islam and that Muslim troops should be on the ground with our support and the support of other major countries. That is how we destroy ISIS, not with American troops in perpetual warfare.MITCHELL: Governor OMalley.OMALLEY: Thank you.(APPLAUSE)Andrea, governors have led us to victory in two world wars by doing what America does best, and that is by joining forces with others by acting in coalition. And I believe that President Obama is doing the right thing in this case.We need to learn the lessons from the past. We do need to provide the special  special ops advisers, we need  do need to provide the technical support, but over the long-term, we need to develop new alliances. We need a much more proactive national security strategy that reduces these threats before they rise to a level where it feels like we need to pull for a division of marines.And I also want to add one other thing here. I appreciate the fact that in our debate, we dont use the term you hear Republicans throwing around trying to look all vibrato (ph) and macho sending other kids  kids into combat, they keep using the term boots on the ground. A woman in Burlington, Iowa said to me, Governor, when youre with your colleagues, please dont refer to my son who has served two tours of duty in Iraq as a pair of boots on the ground. Now, we need to be mindful of learning the lessons of the past.(APPLAUSE)MITCHELL: I have a question. I have a question for Senator Sanders. Did the policies of the Obama administration, in which Secretary Clinton of course was a part, create a vacuum in Iraq and Syria that helped ISIS grow?SANDERS: No. I think the vacuum was created by the disastrous war in Iraq, which I vigorously opposed. Not only did I vote against it, I helped lead the opposition. And what happened there is yes, its easy to get rid of a two-bit dictator like Saddam Hussein, but there wasnt the kind of thought as to what happens the day after you get him and what kind of political vacuum occurs. And who rises up? Groups like ISIS.So I think that President Obama made a promise to the American people when he ran, and he said you know what, Im going to do my best to bring American troops home. And I supported what he did. Our job is to train and provide military support for Muslim countries in the area who are prepared to take on ISIS.And one point I want to make here that is not made very often, you have incredibly wealthy countries in that region, countries like Saudi Arabia, countries like Qatar. Qatar happens to be the largest  wealthiest country per capita in the world. They have got to start putting in some skin in the game and not just ask the United States to do it.(APPLAUSE)MITCHELL: Secretary Clinton, I want to talk to you about red lines, because former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said in a recent interview that President Obamas decision to stand down on planned missile strikes against Damascus after Assad had used chemical weapons hurt the presidents credibility. Should the president have stuck to his red line once he drew it?CLINTON: Look, I think that the presidents decision to go after the chemical weapons once there was a potential opportunity to build on when the Russians opened that door resulted in a very positive outcome. We were able to get the chemical weapons out.I know from my own experience as secretary of State that we were deeply worried about Assads forces using chemical weapons because it would have had not only a horrific affect on people in Syria, but it could very well have affected the surrounding states, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Turkey. So getting those chemical weapons out was a big deal, but...MITCHELL: But should he  should he have stuck to his...CLINTON: Well  but  but...MITCHELL: ... line? Did it hurt U.S. credibility? CLINTON: I think, as commander in chief, youve got to constantly be evaluating the decisions you have to make. I know a little bit about this, having spent many hours in the situation room, advising President Obama.And I want to just add to something that Senator Sanders said, the United States had a very big interest in trying to help stabilize the region. If there is any blame to be spread around, it starts with the prime minister of Iraq, who sectarianized his military, setting Shia against Sunni.It is amplified by Assad, who has waged one of the bloodiest, most terrible attacks on his own people: 250,000-plus dead, millions fleeing. Causing this vacuum that has been filled unfortunately, by terrorist groups, including ISIS.So, I think we are in the midst of great turmoil in this region. We have a proxy conflict going on between Saudi Arabia and Iran. You know, one of the criticisms Ive had of Senator Sanders is his suggestion that, you know, Iranian troops be used to try to end the war in Syria...MITCHELL: Your time is up.CLINTON: ... and go after ISIS, which I dont think would be a good idea.SANDERS: Let me just...MITCHELL: Senator....CLINTON: But overall, a lot of the forces at work in the region are ones that we cannot directly influence, but we can...MITCHELL: Youre out of time.SANDERS: OK. Let me suggest...(CROSSTALK)MITCHELL: Senator Sanders.SANDERS: Where Secretary Clinton and I think, I agree with most of what she said. But where I think we do have an honest disagreement, is that in the incredible quagmire of Syria, where its hard to know whos fighting who and if you give arms to this guy, it may end up in ISIS hand the next day. We all know that.And we all know, no argument, the secretary is absolutely right, Assad is a butcher of his own people, man using chemical weapons against his own people. This is beyond disgusting.But I think in terms of our priorities in the region, our first priority must be the destruction of ISIS. Our second priority must be getting rid of Assad, through some political settlement, working with Iran, working with Russia.But the immediate task is to bring all interests together who want to destroy ISIS, including Russia, including Iran, including our Muslim allies to make that the major priority.OMALLEY: But in all of that senator and secretary, I think were leaving out something very important here. And that is that we still dont have the human intelligence: overt, in terms of diplomatic intelligence or covert, to understand even what the heck happens as the secondary and tertiary effects of some of these things.We are walking through this region, Andrea, without the human intelligence that we need. And we need to make a renewed investment as a country in bringing up a new generation of foreign service officers, and bringing up a new generation of business people and actually understanding and having relationships in these places.So we have a better sense of what the heck happens after a dictator topples and can take action to prevent another safe haven and another iteration of terror.MITCHELL: Your time is us. Lester.HOLT: Senator Sanders mentioned Russia a moment ago. Secretary Clinton, you famously handed Russias foreign minister a reset button in 2009. Since then, Russia has annexed Crimea, fomented a war in Ukraine, provided weapons that downed an airliner and launched operations, as we just did discuss, to support Assad in Syria. As president, would you hand Vladimir Putin a reset button?CLINTON: Well, it would depend on what I got for it and I can tell you what we got in the first term, we got a new start treaty to reduce nuclear weapons between the United States and Russia. We got permission to resupply our troops in Afghanistan by traveling across Russia.We got Russia to sign on to our sanctions against Iran and other very important commitments. So look, in diplomacy, you are always trying to see how you can figure out the interest of the other to see if there isnt some way you can advance your security and your values.When Putin came back in the fall of 2011, it was very clear he came back with a mission. And I began speaking out as soon as that happened because there were some fraudulent elections held, and Russians poured out into the streets to demand their freedom, and he cracked down. And in fact, accused me of fomenting it. So we now know that he has a mixed record to say the least and we have to figure out how to deal with him.HOLT: Whats your relationship with him?CLINTON: Well, my relationship with him, its  its interesting.(LAUGHTER)Its one, I think, of respect. Weve had some very tough dealings with one another. And I know that hes someone that you have to continuingly stand up to because, like many bullies, he is somebody who will take as much as he possibly can unless you do.And we need to get the Europeans to be more willing to stand up, I was pleased they put sanctions on after Crimea and eastern Ukraine and the downing of the airliner, but weve got to be more united in preventing Putin from taking a more aggressive stance in Europe and the Middle East.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: We to want turn right now to the issue of balancing national security concerns with the privacy rights of Americans. That brings us to YouTube and this question.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BROWNLEE: Hi, my name Marques Brownlee, and Ive been making YouTube videos about electronics and gadgets for the past seven years.I think Americas future success is tied to getting all kinds of tech right. Tech companies are responsible for the encryption technology to protect personal data, but the government wants a back door into that information.So do you think its possible to find common ground? And where do you stand on privacy versus security?(END VIDEO CLIP)HOLT: So, Governor OMalley.OMALLEY: Thank you.I believe whether its a back door or a front door that the American principle of law should still hold that our federal government should have to get a warrant, whether they want to come through the back door or your front door.(APPLAUSE)And I also agree, Lester, with Benjamin Franklin, who said, no people should ever give up their privacy or their freedoms in a promise for security.So were a collaborative people. We need collaborative leadership here with Silicon Valley and other bright people in my own state of Maryland and around the NSA that can actually figure this out.But there are certain immutable principles that will not become antique things in our country so long as we defend our country and its values and its freedoms. And one of those things is our right to be secure in our homes, and our right to expect that our federal government should have to get a warrant.I also want to the say that while weve made some progress on the Patriot Act, I do believe that we need an adversarial court system there. We need a public advocate. We need to develop jurisprudence so that we can develop a body of law that protects the privacy of Americans in the information and digital age.HOLT: Thats time.You have all talked about what you would do fighting ISIS over there, but weve been hit in this country by home-grown terrorists, from Chattanooga to San Bernardino, the recent shooting of a police officer in Philadelphia. How are you going to fight the lone wolves here, Senator Sanders?OMALLEY: Yes, Lester, year in and year out I was the leader of the U.S. ...HOLT: Thats a question to Senator Sanders. I wasnt clear, I apologize.SANDERS: OK. I just wanted to add, in the previous question, I voted against the USA Patriot Act for many of the reasons that Governor OMalley mentioned. But it is not only the government that we have to worry about, it is private corporations.You would all be amazed, or maybe not, about the amount of information private companies and the government has in terms of the Web sites that you access, the products that you buy, where you are this very moment.And it is very clear to me that public policy has not caught up with the explosion of technology. So yes, we have to work with Silicon Valley to make sure that we do not allow ISIS to transmit information...HOLT: But in terms of lone wolves, the threat, how would you do it?SANDERS: Right. What we have got to do there is, among other things, as I was just saying, have Silicon Valley help us to make sure that information being transmitted through the Internet or in other ways by ISIS is, in fact, discovered.But I do believe we can do that without violating the constitutional and privacy rights of the American people.(CROSSTALK)HOLT: We have to go to a  we have to go to a break, and when we come back, were going to get to some of the burning questions these candidates have yet to answer and are totally eager to talk about.CLINTON: Oh, were breaking? OK.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HOLT: And welcome back to Charleston.As we were going to a break, Secretary Clinton, I cut you off. Ill give you 30 seconds to respond on the issue of lone wolves.OMALLEY: Can I get 30 seconds, too?(LAUGHTER)SANDERS: Can I get 50 seconds?HOLT: Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Well, I wanted to say, and Ill do it quickly, I was very pleased that leaders of President Obamas administration went out to Silicon Valley last week and began exactly this conversation about what we can do, consistent with privacy and security.We need better intelligence cooperation, we need to be sure that we are getting the best intelligence that we can from friends and allies around the world. And then, weve got to recognize our first line of defense against lone wolf attacks is among Muslim Americans.And it is not only shameful, it is dangerous for the kinds of comments youre hearing from the Republican side.We need to be reaching out and unifying our country against terrorist attacks and lone wolves, and working with Muslim Americans.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: And Andrea has a follow-up.OMALLEY: And Andrea  Andrea  Andrea...MITCHELL: Just a  just a quick follow-up, though, Secretary Clinton. Just a moment, Governor.OMALLEY: Andrea, when can I get my 30 seconds?MITCHELL: But  but  Secretary Clinton, you said that the leaders from the intelligence community went to Silicon Valley, they were flatly turned down. They got nowhere.CLINTON: That is not what Ive heard. Let me leave it at that.OMALLEY: Andrea, I need to talk about homeland security and preparedness.Ever since the attacks of September 11th  30 seconds.(LAUGHTER)Ever since the attacks of September 11th, my colleagues, Democratic and Republican mayors, Democratic and Republican governors, made me their leader on homeland security and preparedness.OMALLEY: Here in the homeland, unlike combating ISIL abroad, were almost like its  your bodys immune system. Its able to protect your body against bad bugs, not necessarily because it outnumbers them, but its better connected  the fusion centers, the biosurveillance systems, better prepared first responders.But theres another front in this battle, and it is this. Thats the political front, and if Donald Trump wants to start a registry in our country of people by faith, he can start with me, and I will sign up as one who is totally opposed to his fascist appeals that wants to vilify American Muslims. That can do more damage to our democracy than any...(CROSSTALK)HOLT: All right, thats time, and  and we do...(APPLAUSE)... we do have to move on.Secretary Clinton, this is the first time...SANDERS: Can I get a  can I just get a very brief response? Very brief.HOLT: Thirty  30  30 seconds, Senator.SANDERS: OK. One  and I agree with what the secretary said, and what Governor OMalley said. But heres an issue that we also should talk about. We have a $600 billion military budget. It is a budget larger than the next eight countries.Unfortunately, much of that budget continues to fight the old Cold War with the Soviet Union. Very little of that budget  less than 10 percent  actually goes into fighting ISIS and international terrorism. We need to be thinking hard about making fundamental changes in the priorities of the Defense Department.HOLT: All right. Secretary Clinton...(APPLAUSE)... this is the first time that a spouse of a former president could be elected president. You have said that President Clinton would advise you on economic issues, but be specific, if you can. Are you talking about a kitchen-table role on economics, or will he have a real policy role?CLINTON: Well, itll start at the kitchen table, well see how it goes from there. And I...(APPLAUSE)... Im going to have the very best advisers that I can possibly have, and when it comes to the economy and what was accomplished under my husbands leadership and the 90s  especially when it came to raising incomes for everybody and lifting more people out of poverty than at any time in recent history  you bet.Im going to ask for his ideas, Im going ask for his advice, and Im going use him as a goodwill emissary to go around the country to find the best ideas weve got, because I do believe, as he said, everything thats wrong with America has been solved somewhere in America.We just have to do more of it, and we have to reach out, especially into poor communities and communities of color, to give more people their own chance to get ahead.HOLT: Senator sanders, a 30 second response, sir.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Great ideas, Governor OMalley, Secretary Clinton, but heres the truth. If you have an administration stacked with Wall Street appointees, it aint going to accomplish very much.So heres a promise that I make  and I mentioned a moment ago how corrupt the system is  Goldman Sachs, paying a $5 billion fine, gives this country, in recent history, a Republican secretary of treasury, a Democratic secretary of treasury.Heres a promise. If elected president, Goldman Sachs is not going to have  bring forth a secretary of treasury for a Sanders administration.(APPLAUSE)MILLER: Senator Sanders, let me ask you a question. You called Bill Clintons past transgressions, quote, totally, totally, totally disgraceful and unacceptable. Senator, do you regret saying that?SANDERS: I was asked a question. You know, one of the things, Andrea, and I  that question annoys me. I cannot walk down the street  Secretary Clinton knows this  without being told how much I have to attack secretary Clinton, want to get me on the front pages of the paper, Id make some vicious attack.I have avoided doing that. Trying to run an issue-oriented campaign.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: I was asked a question.MILLER: You didnt have to answer it that way, though. Why did you?SANDERS: Well  then if I dont answer it, then theres another front page, so its yes (ph).(LAUGHTER)And I mean this seriously. You know that. Weve been through this. Yes, his behavior was deplorable. Have I ever once said a word about that issue? No, I have not. Im going to debate Secretary Clinton, Governor OMalley, on the issues facing the American people, not Bill Clintons personal behavior.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: We will take a break. Well continue from Charleston right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) HOLT: Welcome back everybody. Finally, before we go tonight, we set out here to understand points of differences between you. We believe weve learned a lot here, but before we leave, is there anything that you really wanted to say tonight that you havent gotten a chance to say.And, well start with Governor OMalley.(LAUGHTER)HOLT: Didnt see that coming, did you?OMALLEY: Yes, but were going to have to get 20 minutes to do it, so.(LAUGHTER)MITCHELL: ...too long (ph).OMALLEY: I believe there are many issues. I have 60 seconds for this?HOLT: Sixty seconds, wed appreciate it.OMALLEY: There are so many issues that we havent been able to discuss here. We have not fully discussed immigration reform, and the deplorable number of immigrant detention camps that our nations now maintaining. We havent discussed the shameful treatment that the people of Puerto Rico, our fellow Americans, are getting treated with by these hedge funds that are working them over.(APPLAUSE)OMALLEY: We havent discussed the fact that in our hemisphere we have the danger of nation-state failures because of drug traffickers; and Honduras, and Guatemala and El Salvador.I guess the bottom line is this, look we are a great people the way we act at home and abroad based on the beliefs that unite us. Our belief in the dignity of every person, our belief in our own common good. There is now challenge that is too great for us to overcome provided we bring forward in these divided times, new leadership that can heal our divides here at home and bring our principles into alignment abroad.Were on the threshold of a new era of American progress and I believe we have only need to join forces together and cross that threshold into a new era of American prosperity.HOLT: And thats time.OMALLEY: Thanks a lot.HOLT: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well Lester, I spent a lot of time last week being outraged by whats happening in Flint, Michigan and I think every single American should be outraged. Weve had a city in the United States of America where the population which is poor in many ways and majority African American has been drinking and bathing in lead contaminated water. And the governor of that state acted as though he didnt really care.He had request for help and he had basically stone walled. Ill tell you what, if the kids in a rich suburb of Detroit had been drinking contaminated water and being bathed in it, there wouldve been action.So I sent my top campaign aide down there to talk to the mayor of Flint to see what I could to help. I issued a statement about what we needed to do and then I went on a T.V. show and I said, it was outrageous that the governor hadnt acted and within two hours he had.HOLT: And thats time.CLINTON: I want to be a president who takes care of the big problems and the problems that are affecting the people of our country everyday.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Thank you.Senator Sanders?SANDERS: Well, Secretary Clinton was right and what I did which I think is also right, is demanded the resignation of governor. A man who acts that irresponsibly should not stay in power.Now, we are a great nation  and weve heard a lot of great ideas here tonight. Lets be honest and lets be truthful. Very little is going to be done to transform our economy and to create the kind of middle class we need unless we end a corrupt campaign finance system which is undermining American democracy.Weve got to get rid of Super PACs, weve got to get rid of Citizens United and what weve got to do is create a political revolution which revitalizes American democracy; which brings millions of young people and working people into the political process. To say loudly and clearly, that the government of the United States of America belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.HOLT: All right. Well thank you and thanks to all of you for being here tonight shedding light on some of the differences as Americans get ready to vote.I also want to thank the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and certainly my friend and colleague, Andrea Mitchell. This has been great. Its been a great spirited conversation and American people appreciate it.Let me turn it over to my friend Chuck Todd now. Chuck?TODD: Lester thank you and a terrific job moderating this debate tonight, Andrea as well. What a lively substantive debate. We thought there were going to be fireworks, there certainly were.You heard sort of the sharp disagreements when it comes to guns, when it comes to Wall Street Reform, when it comes to health care and even a few things on foreign policy. Were going to break all of it down here in a few minutes but were going to try to sneak in a short break.And when we come back, instant analysis. Well see if we can find out what the campaigns are doing. Were live right here in the spin room in Charleston, South Carolina.END'

aS'Following is a transcript of the main Republican presidential debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.NEIL CAVUTO: It is 9:00 p.m. here at the North Charleston Coliseum and Performing Arts Center in South Carolina. Welcome to the sixth Republican presidential debate of the 2016 campaign, here on the Fox Business Network.Im Neil Cavuto, alongside my friend and co-moderator Maria Bartiromo.MARIA BARTIROMO: Tonight we are working with Facebook to ask the candidates the questions voters want answered. And according to Facebook, the U.S. election has dominated the global conversation, with 131 million people talking about the 2016 race. That makes it the number one issue talked about on Facebook last year worldwide.CAVUTO: Now, the seven candidates on the stage tonight were selected based on their standing in six national polls, as well as polls in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, those standings determining the position on the stage of the candidates tonight. And here they are.Businessman Donald Trump.(APPLAUSE)Texas senator Ted Cruz.(APPLAUSE)Florida senator Marco Rubio.(APPLAUSE)Neurosurgeon Ben Carson.(APPLAUSE)New Jersey governor Chris Christie.(APPLAUSE)Former Florida governor Jeb Bush.And Ohio governor John Kasich.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Tonights rules are simple: up to 90 seconds for each answer, one minute for each follow-up response. And if a candidate goes over the allotted time, youll hear this.(BELL RINGS) So lets get started. Candidates, jobs and growth  two of the biggest issues facing the country right now. In his State of the Union address earlier this week, the president said, quote, we have the strongest, most durable economy in the world.And according to our Facebook research, jobs is one of the biggest issues resonating across the country, including here in South Carolina. The president is touting 14 million new jobs and an unemployment rate cut in half.The president said that anyone who claims Americas economy is in decline is peddling fiction. Senator Cruz, what do you see that he doesnt?CRUZ: Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.Let me start  I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something. Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.In that State of the Union, President Obama didnt so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran. President Obamas preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei. And Ill tell you, it was heartbreaking.But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage. (APPLAUSE)And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)Now, on to your substantive question. The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs. And you know, hes right. If youre a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great. The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama. But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977. Median wages have stagnated. And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Governor Kasich, we are not even two weeks into this stock trading year, but (inaudible) investors already lost $1.6 trillion in market value. That makes it the worst start to a new year ever. Many worry that things will get even worse, and that banks and financial stocks are particularly vulnerable.Now, if this escalates, like it did back when Barack Obama first assumed the presidency, what actions would you take if this same thing happens all over again just as, in this example, you are taking over the presidency?KASICH: Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs. And Ive done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt. And our economy was growing like crazy. Its the same thing that I did in Ohio. Its a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety. It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way. And if you tax cuts  if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, youre going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the  in the world.But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline. We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget. And when you do that, when youre in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.Right now, you dont have the  you have taxes that are too high. You have regulations  I mean, come on, theyre affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses. They are  theyre in a position where theyre smothering people. And I mean, are you kidding me? Were nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise. You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy. And how do I know it? Because Ive done it. I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici. And Ive done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.Our wages are growing faster than the national average. Were running surpluses. And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: We know that recent global events have many people worried  Iran detaining American sailors, forcing them to apologize; North Korea and its nuclear ambitions; an aggressive China; and a Middle East that continues to deteriorate, not to mention ISIS is getting stronger.Governor Christie, sometimes it seems the world is on fire. Where and when should a president use military action to restore order?CHRISTIE: Well, Maria, Im glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about whats going on in the world. Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama. And Ive got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?(APPLAUSE)The fact is, theres a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess. The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world. And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing theyve never said about me is that Im misunderstood. And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know were going to keep it.Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience. And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, hes absolutely right. Its a  its absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to whats going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.The president doesnt understand  and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton  and heres my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight. If youre worried about the world being on fire, youre worried about how were going to use our military, youre worried about strengthening our military and youre worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obamas leadership.I will not do that. If Im the nominee, she wont get within 10 miles of the White House.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Just to be clear Governor, where and when would you use military action?CHRISTIE: MIlitary action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world. We are not the worlds policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either. We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships. It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Governor Bush, the president just told the nation two nights ago that America is back and that the idea that our enemies are getting stronger or that this country is getting weaker, well, its just rhetoric and hot air. Now other Democrats go even further, sir, saying Republicans even suggesting such comments actually embolden our enemies. I guess they would include you. What do you say?BUSH: Well first of all, the idea that somehow were better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe. The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.Think about it. With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists. Hes missing the whole point, that Americas leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, whos the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.(APPLAUSE)Ive learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military. In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we cant even project force. Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and were in a much difficult  were in a much different position than we should be.And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well. Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military. We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the worlds policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: So I take it from that you do not agree with the president.BUSH: No. And worse  worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.Think about it. She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have  that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess. And that is wrong.And you know what? Heres the problem. If she gets elected, shes under investigation with the FBI right now. If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse. We need to stop that. (LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Senator Rubio, the president says that ISIS doesnt threaten our national existence like a Germany or a Japan back in World War II, that the terror group is nothing more than twisted souls plotting attacks in their garages.But House Homeland Security Committee recently said that over 1,000 ongoing investigations of homegrown extremism in 50 states. So how do you define the threat? Germany then or dangerous nut cases now?RUBIO: Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton. She wouldnt just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.(APPLAUSE)Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States. Ever.(APPLAUSE)On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power. Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size. And thats how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.He doesnt understand the threat in ISIS. He consistently underestimates it but I do not. There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.When Im president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS. The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them. And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Thank you, Senator.BARTIROMO: Dr. Carson, the president says he does not want to treat ISIS as a foreign army, but ISIS is neither a country nor a government. How do you attack a network that does not respect national borders?CARSON: Well, Im very happy to get a question this early on. I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.(LAUGHTER)You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the presidents proclamations. The fact of the matter is he doesnt realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before. Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid. And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously. And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.I mean, just think about a scenario like that. They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse. They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs. Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point? He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.But heres the real key. We have the worlds best military, even though hes done everything he can to diminish it. And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we dont tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Mr. Trump, at the State of the Union, the president pointed to a guest who was a Syrian refugee you might recall whose wife and daughter and other family members were killed in an air attack. Now he fled that country seeking asylum here, ultimately ended up in Detroit where hes now trying to start a new life.The president says that that doctor is the real face of these refugees and not the one that you and some of your colleagues on this stage are painting; that you prefer the face of fear and terror and that you would refuse to let in anyone into this country seeking legitimate asylum. How do you answer that?TRUMP: Its not fear and terror, its reality. You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.(APPLAUSE)You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where theres a  the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow. Theyre very, very badly wounded. They will  some will follow. And you look around, and you see whats happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor  very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.That could be the great Trojan Horse. It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction. When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women? It looked like very few women. Very few children. Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and theyre saying whats going on?You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized  they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15  going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look  a good strong look and thats what we have. We are nineteen trillion dollars  our countrys a mess and we cant let all these people come into our country and break our borders. We cant do it.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Senator Cruz, the New York Times is reporting that you failed to properly disclose a million dollars in loans from Goldman Sachs and CitiBank. During your senate race, your campaign said, it was inadvertent. A million dollars is inadvertent?CRUZ: Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times. You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they dont hide their views. The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, Anybody But Cruz. Had that actually  that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, It Follows that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.So you know the New York Times and I dont have exactly have the warmest of relationships. Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate  unlike Hillary Clinton, I dont have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars. When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars. He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks. And the entire New York times attack  is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing. But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other. But if thats the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well. BARTIROMO: Thank you.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO: All right. Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate, right here in North Charleston, South Carolina. Lets get right back to the questions. And Ill start with you, Senator Cruz.Now you are, of course, a strict constitutionalist  no one would doubt that. And as you know, the U.S. Constitution says only natural-born citizens are eligible for the office of president of the United States. Stop me if youve heard this before. Now, you were born...(LAUGHTER)... you were born in Canada to an American mother. So you were and are considered an American citizen. But that fellow next to you, Donald Trump  and others  have said that being born in Canada means you are not natural-born, and that has raised questions about your eligibility.Do you want to try to close this topic once and for all tonight?CRUZ: Well, Neil, Im glad were focusing on the important topics of the evening.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there. There was nothing to this birther issue.(LAUGHTER)Now, since September, the Constitution hasnt changed.(LAUGHTER)But the poll numbers have.(APPLAUSE)And I recognize  I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa. But the facts and the law here are really quite clear. Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen. Thats why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen. Thats why George Romney, Mitts dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on  some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.(APPLAUSE)(UNKNOWN): Not me.CRUZ: Because  because Donalds mother was born in Scotland. She was naturalized. Now, Donald...TRUMP: But I was born here.CRUZ: ... on the issue  on the issue of citizenship, Donald...TRUMP: (inaudible). Big difference.CRUZ: ... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, Im not going to use your mothers birth against you.TRUMP: OK, good. Because it wouldnt work.CRUZ: Youre an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on whos best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because thats the most important question facing the country.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Mr. Trump...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: ... that you raised it because of his rising poll numbers.TRUMP: ... first of all, let me just tell you something  and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself  NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll  headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down. I mean, so dont  so you cant  you cant...(BOOING)... they dont like the Wall Street Journal. They dont like NBC, but I like the poll.(LAUGHTER)And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, Im beating you. So  you know, you shouldnt misrepresent how well youre doing with the polls.(APPLAUSE)You dont have to say that. In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because thats a misrepresentation, number one.Number two, this isnt me saying it. I dont care. I think Im going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way. Thank you.Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard  of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this. OK? There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.Heres the problem. Were running. Were running. He does great. I win. I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we cant take him along for the ride. I dont like that. OK?(LAUGHTER)The fact is  and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible). See, they dont like that. They dont like that.(AUDIENCE BOOING)No, they dont like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.(LAUGHTER)But  if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit. You have a big lawsuit over your head while youre running. And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office? So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide. And you shouldnt have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: Why are you saying this now  right now? Why are you raising this issue now?TRUMP: Because now hes going a little bit better. No, I didnt care (inaudible). Its true. No, its true. Hey look, he never had a chance. Now, hes doing better. Hes got probably a four or five percent chance.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Neil...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: The fact is, there is a big overhang. Theres a big question mark on your head. And you cant do that to the party. You really cant. You cant do that to the party. You have to have certainty. Even if it was a one percent chance, and its far greater than one percent because (inaudible).I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you cant run. If there was a  and you know Im not bringing a suit. I promise. But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty. You cant have a question. I can agree with you or not, but you cant have a question over your head.CAVUTO: Senator, do you want to respond?CRUZ: Well, listen, Ive spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court. And Ill tell you, Im not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.TRUMP: You dont have to. Take it from Lawrence Tribe.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Take it from your professors...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero. And Mr. Trump is very focused...TRUMP: Hes wrong. Hes wrong.CRUZ: ... on Larry Tribe. Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is. Hes a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gores lawyer in Bush versus Gore. Hes a major Hillary Clinton supporter. And theres a reason why Hillarys supporters are echoing Donalds attacks on me, because Hillary...TRUMP: He is not the only one.CRUZ: ... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.TRUMP: There are many lawyers.CRUZ: And Ill tell you what, Donald, you  you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P. slot.(LAUGHTER) Ill tell you what. If this all works out, Im happy to consider naming you as V.P. So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.TRUMP: No  no...(LAUGHTER)... I think if it doesnt...(APPLAUSE)I like that. I like it. Id consider it. But I think Ill go back to building buildings if it doesnt work out.CRUZ: Actually, Id love to get you to build a wall.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: I have a feeling its going to work out, actually.(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: Let me (inaudible). I was invoked in that question, so let me just say  in that answer  let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.(LAUGHTER)But the real  but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about. OK? Listen, we  this is the greatest country in the history of mankind. But in 2008, we elected a president that didnt want to fix America. He wants to change America. We elected a president that doesnt believe in the Constitution. He undermines it. We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage. We elected a president that doesnt believe in the free enterprise system.This election has to be about reversing all of that damage. Thats why Im running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders. When Im president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military. And when Im president, were not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world. When Im president, were going to have a president that acts like it.BARTIROMO: Thank you, senator.BARTIROMO: Mr. Trump, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley in her response to the State of the Union address(APPLAUSE)BARITROMO: appeared to choose sides within the party, saying Republicans should resist, quote, the siren call of the angriest voices. She confirmed, she was referring to you among others. Was she out of line? And, how would a President Trump unite the party?TRUMP: Okay. First of all, Nikki this afternoon said Im a friend of hers. Actually a close friend. And wherever you are sitting Nikki, Im a friend. Were friends. Thats good.(LAUGHTER)But she did say there was anger. And I could say, oh, Im not angry. Im very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger. Our military is a disaster.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Our healthcare is a horror show. Obamacare, were going to repeal it and replace it. We have no borders. Our vets are being treated horribly. Illegal immigration is beyond belief. Our country is being run by incompetent people. And yes, I am angry.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: And I wont be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, Im very, very angry. And I say that to Nikki. So when Nikki said that, I wasnt offended. She said the truth.One of your colleagues interviewed me. And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, shes right. Im not fighting that. I didnt find it offensive at all. Im angry because our country is a mess.(APPLAUSE)BARITROMO: But what are you going to do about it?CAVUTO: Marco Rubio. Im sorry, its the time constraints. You and Governor Christie have been exchanging some fairly nasty words of late, and I will allow the governor to respond as well.The governor went so far to say, you wont be able to slime your way to the White House. Hes referring to a series of ads done by a PAC, speaking on your behalf, that say quote,One high tax, Common Core, liberal, energy-loving, Obamacare, Medicaid-expanding president is enough. You think you went too far on that and do you want to apologize to the governor?RUBIO: You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: We have a president of the United States that is undermining this countrys security and expanding the role of...CAVUTO: That is not my question.RUBIO: Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil. He is  this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government. This president is undermining our military. He is undermining our standing in the world. I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control. This president, this president is more interested in funding  less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned  hes more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood. All Im saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country. It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary. Let me tell you, if we dont get this election right, there may be no turning back for America. Were on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage. No one is a socialist. No one here is under FBI investigation. So we have a good group of people.CAVUTO: Is he a liberal?RUBIO: Our next president...CAVUTO: Is he a liberal?RUBIO: Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood. Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.CAVUTO: Governor?(APPLAUSE)CHRISTIE: I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because were running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marcos ear too.(LAUGHTER)So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then. So lets set the facts straight. First of all, I didnt support Sonia Sotomayor. Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban. I have vetoed a reduction this clip size. I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey. So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator. See when youre a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk. And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what youre saying is accurate or not.When youre a governor, youre held accountable for everything you do. And the people of New Jersey, Ive seen it.(APPLAUSE)And the last piece is this. I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed. That was before he was running against me. Now that he is, hes changed his tune.Im never going to change my tune. I like Marco Rubio. Hes a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: Neil, my name was mentioned here. Neil, my name was mentioned as well.Heres the deal, Chris is totally right. Hes been a good governor, and hes a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton. And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as its going to be  this is not being bad.These attack ads are going to be part of life. Everybody just needs to get used to it. Everybodys records going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.(APPLAUSE)Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesnt disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.And so everybody needs to discount some of the things youre going to hear in these ads, and discount the  the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.CARSON: Neil, I was mentioned too.CAVUTO: You were?CARSON: Yeah, he said everybody. (LAUGHTER)And  and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we  and when I say we, Republicans  tore themselves apart.You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it. And we got to look at the big picture here.BARTIROMO: Governor Kasich...(APPLAUSE)... Governor Kasich, Hillary Clinton is getting some serious competition from Senator Bernie Sanders. Hes now at 41 percent in the latest CBS/New York Times poll. Vice President Biden sang his praises, saying Bernie is speaking to a yearning that is deep and real, and he has credibility on it.So what does it say about our country that a candidate who is a self-avowed socialist and who doesnt think a 90 percent tax rate is too high could be the Democratic nominee?KASICH: Well, if thats the case, were going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee. Thats not even an issue. But look...(APPLAUSE)... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you hes not going to be president of the United States. So heres this  the situation, I think, Maria.And this is what we have to  I  Ive got to tell you, when wages dont rise  and they havent for a lot of families for a number of years  its very, very difficult for them.Part of the reason why it hasnt risen because sometimes were not giving people the skills they need. Sometimes its because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in  in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.People are upset about it. Ill tell you what else theyre upset about: youre 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you youre out of work, and you dont know where to go and where to turn. Do we have answer for that? We do. There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because theyve got great value.Ill tell you what else people are concerned about. Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they cant get a good job. We got to do a lot about the high cost of high  higher education, but weve got to make sure were training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.(APPLAUSE)Let me tell you that, in this country  in this country, people are concerned about their economic future. Theyre very concerned about it. And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to  keeping them from getting it.Thats not the America that Ive ever known. My father used to say, Johnny, we never  we dont hate the rich. We just want to be the rich. And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America  and I mean everybody in America  having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.Im president  look, Ive done it once. Ive done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes. The economy was really booming.And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the  than the national average. A growth of 385,000 jobs.(BELL RINGS)Its not that hard. Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts. Get it done, because our  our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done. And, folks, we will. You count on it.BARTIROMO: Dr. Carson, one of the other candidates on this stage has brought Bill Clintons past indiscretions. Is that a legitimate topic in this election? And what do you think of the notion that Hillary Clinton is an enabler of sexual misconduct?CARSON: Well, theres not question that we should be able to look at past president whether theyre married to somebody whos running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means. But you know, heres the real issue, is this America anymore? Do we still have standards? Do we still have values and principles?You know, you look at whats going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society. You know, we have a war on virtual everything  race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars. Every war you can imaging, we have people at each others throat and our strength is actually in our unity.You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section  you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names. Where did that spirit come from in America? It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that. And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong. And lets not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great. Theyve been beaten into submission. Its time for us to stand up for what we believe in.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Well, we are not done. Coming up, one of the top things people are talking about on Facebook, guns. And you can join us live us on this stage in the conversation during this commercial break right from home. You can go to Facebook.com/(inaudible). We will be streaming live and talking about how we think the debate is going so far.Were back in a moment in Charleston, South Carolina.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debates, right here in North Charleston. Lets get right back to the questions.Governor Bush, gun rights, one of the top issues seen on Facebook with close to 3 million people talking about it in the past month. Right here in Charleston, Dylann Roof, who has been accused of killing nine people in a nearby church, reportedly had not passed his background check when he got his gun. What is the harm in tightening standards for not only who buys guns, but those who sell them?BUSH: First of all, Id like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the (APPLAUSE)BUSH: The Emanuel AME church killings. And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: I dont know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place. Look, heres the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake. The law itself requires a background check, but that didnt fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.We dont need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job. Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not  would not have passed a background check. The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.Thats what they do, whether its the San Bernardino attack or if its these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is. It isnt law-abiding gun owners.Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, youre going away. Youre going away for a long, long while.And thats what we should focus on is the violence in our communities. Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, youre going to be much better off than creating a political argument where theres a big divide.The other issue is mental health. Thats a serious issue that we could work on. Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: The presidents first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesnt have. Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges dont have access to guns.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.Mr. Trump, are there any circumstances that you think we should be limiting gun sales of any kind in America?TRUMP: No. I am a 2nd amendment person. If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldnt have 14 or 15 people dead right now.If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldnt have 130 people plus dead. So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.We have a huge mental health problem in this country. Were closing hospitals, were closing wards, were closing so many because the states want to save money. We have to get back into looking at whats causing it. The guns dont pull the trigger. Its the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order. He doesnt want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress. You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation. He just writes out an executive order. Not supposed to happen that way.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you sir.XXX where you get Congress.TRUMP: You get the Congress. You get the Senate. You get together. You do legislation. He just writes out an order, executive order. Its not supposed to happen that way.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Senator Rubio, you said that President Obama wants to take peoples guns away. Yet under his presidency, gun sales have more than doubled. That doesnt sound like a White House unfriendly to gun owners.RUBIO: That sounds like people are afraid the presidents going to take their guns away.(APPLAUSE)Look, the Second Amendment is not an option. It is not a suggestion. It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families. I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would. I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would. I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.Heres my second problem. None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why hes doing these things would have been preventive. You know why? Because criminals dont buy their guns from a gun show. They dont buy their guns from a collector. And they dont buy their guns from a gun store. They get  they steal them. They get them on the black market.And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show. These...(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)... his answer  you name it. If theres an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control. Heres a fact. We are in a war against ISIS. They are trying to attack us here in America. They attacked us in Philadelphia last week. They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago. And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.When Im president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: But what fact can you point to, Senator  what fact can you point to that the president would take away everyones gun? You dont think thats (inaudible)?RUBIO: About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he cant wait to restrict peoples access to guns. He has never defended...(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: Ill give you a fact. Well, let me tell you this. Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion. That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.(APPLAUSE)He doesnt meet  heres the difference. When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, its not how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans. Its give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns. That will never happen when I am president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Governor Christie, you, too, have criticized the presidents recent executive action on gun control, saying its unconstitutional, another step to bypass Congress. But hasnt your own position on guns evolved, sir? The New Jersey Star-Ledger reports that you signed several laws to regulate the possession of firearms, and that you argued back in August 2013, and I quote, These common sense measures will strengthen New Jerseys already tough gun laws.So isnt that kind of what the president wants to do now?CHRISTIE: No, absolutely not. The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people. And the fact is that thats not a democracy. Thats a dictatorship. And we need to very, very concerned about that.See, heres the thing. I dont think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident. I dont think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat. I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit. We have made it easier to do that, not harder. And the way weve done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders. This guy is a petulant child. Thats what he is. I mean, you know...(APPLAUSE)... the fact is, Neil, lets think about  lets think about  and I want to maybe  I hope the president is watching tonight, because heres what Id like to tell him.Mr. President, were not against you. Were against your policies. When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate. You had only 21 Republican governors in this country. And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority weve had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.The American people have rejected your agenda and now youre trying to go around it. Thats not right. Its not constitutional. And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: So what is the answer, Senator Cruz, to stop mass shootings and violent crime, up in 30 cities across the country?CRUZ: The answer is simple. Your prosecute criminals. You target the bad guys. You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do  done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general. Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns. He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials. And Ill tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters  the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next presidents going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.And Ill note that California senator  Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, give me your guns, Im rounding them up, she would.And let me make a final point on this. Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment. Unless you are clinically insane...(LAUGHTER)... thats what you say in a primary. But the voters are savvier than that. They recognize that peoples actions dont always match their words. Ive got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.Theres a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race. Theres a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...(BELL RINGS) ... and theres a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans  we defeated that gun control legislation.And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.BARTIROMO: Senator...(APPLAUSE)... let me follow up and switch gears.Senator Cruz, you suggested Mr. Trump, quote, embodies New York values. Could you explain what you mean by that?CRUZ: You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: I am from New York. I dont.CRUZ: What  what  youre from New York? So you might not.(LAUGHTER)But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.(APPLAUSE)And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York. But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.And  and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked  my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteens Born in the USA, and I was asked what I thought of that.And I said, well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, New York, New York? And  and  you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert. And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views hes describing now.And his explanation  he said, look, Im from New York, thats what we believe in New York. Those arent Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York. And so that was his explanation.And  and I guess I can  can frame it another way. Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan. Im just saying.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Are you sure about that?CAVUTO: Maria...TRUMP: So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.(APPLAUSE)And just so  if I could, because he insulted a lot of people. Ive had more calls on that statement that Ted made  New York is a great place. Its got great people, its got loving people, wonderful people.When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York. You had two one hundred...(APPLAUSE)... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down. I saw them come down. Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction. I was down there, and Ive never seen anything like it.And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death  nobody understood it. And it was with us for months, the smell, the air. And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers. And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Governor bush, for the third time in as many months, the Iranians have provoked us, detaining us, as weve been discussing, with these 10 Navy sailors Tehran had said strayed into their waters. The sailors were released, but only after shown on video apologizing for the incident. This occurring only weeks after Iran fired multiple rockets within 1,500 yards of a U.S. aircraft carrier and then continued to test medium range missiles.Now youve claimed that such actions indicate Tehran has little to fear from a President Obama. I wonder, sir, what would change if they continued doing this sort of thing under a President Jeb Bush?BUSH: Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military. Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navys going to be cut again. Its now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.The deployments are too high for the military personnel. We dont have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment. The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman. The planes are older than the pilots. Were gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that were back in the game.Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board. We should reimpose sanctions, theyve already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that were back in the game with Israel (APPLAUSE)... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations. The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak. This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran. We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Thank you, Governor. Governor Kasich, while everyone has been focusing on Irans provocations, Im wondering what you make of what Saudi Arabia has been doing and its recent moves in the region, including its execution of a well-known Shiite cleric and its move to dramatically increase oil production, some say in an effort to drive down oil prices and force a lot of U.S. oil producers out of business.Sure enough, oil prices have tumbled. One brokerage house is predicting a third or more of American oil producers and those heavily invested in fracking will go bankrupt, and soon Saudi Arabia and OPEC will be back in the drivers seat.U.S. energy player Harold Hamrie similarly told me with friends like these, who needs enemies? Do you agree?KASICH: Well, let me  let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience. I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina. Let em also tell you...(APPLAUSE)... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense. And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems. So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, its so critical for us to be energy independent, and were getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.Were seeing it in my state and well see it in this country. And thats why we must make sure we continue to frack.In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is theyre funding radical clerics through their madrasses. That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way. And I was going to tell you, whether Im president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that were going to support you, were in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but youve got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.(APPLAUSE)So look, in foreign policy  in foreign policy, its strength, but youve got to be cool. Youve got to have a clear vision of where you want to go. And Im going to tell you, that it  Im going to suggest to you here tonight, that you cant do on the job training.Ive seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War. You see what the Saudis  deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time theyre going right with us. And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.Thank you.CAVUTO: Thank you John.BARTIROMO: Theres much more ahead including the fight against ISIS. More from Charleston, South Carolina when we come right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: We welcome back to the Republican Presidential Debate, right back to the questions.Candidates, the man who made fighting ISIS the cornerstone of his campaign, South Carolina Senator, Lindsey Graham is out the race but he joins us tonight in the audience.(APPLAUSE)He says, the air-strike now in their 16th month have been ineffective. Dr. Carson ...CARSON: Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?BARTIROMO: The air-strikes.CARSON: OK.BARTIROMO: Now in their 16th month are ineffective. Dr. Carson, do you think Senator Graham is right in wanting to send 20,000 troops  ground troops to Iraq and Syria to take out ISIS?CARSON: Well, theres no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I dont believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.I think we need to do a lot more than were doing. Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need. I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we dont tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.In addition to that...(APPLAUSE)... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue. You know, some of these  these engagement rules that the administration has  were not going to bomb a tanker thats coming out of there because there might be a person in it  give me a break.Just tell them that, you put people in there, were going to bomb them. So dont put people in there if you dont want them bombed. You know, thats so simple.(APPLAUSE)And then we need to shut down  we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers. Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go. They should be running all the time, then they wont have time to plan attacks against us.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir. Senator Graham has also said that the U.S. will find Arab support for its coalition if it removes Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. And I quote, The now king of Saudi Arabia told us, you can have our army, you just got to deal with Assad.The emir of Qatar said, Ill pay for the operation, but they are not going to fight ISIS and let Damascus fall into the hands of the Iranians. Assad has to go.Governor Christie, how important is it to remove Assad from power and how would you do it?CHRISTIE: Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot. You think about it  this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state  drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that were going to attack.He used chemical weapons, hes killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing. In fact, hes done worse than nothing.This president  and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer  she called Assad a reformer. Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad. The fact of the matter is were not going to have peace  we are not going to have peace in Syria. Were not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we dont have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.The Syrians should stay in Syria. They shouldnt be going to Europe. And heres the last piece...(APPLAUSE)... youre not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge. Youre simply not. And so Senator Graham is right about this.And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.And believe me, Assad is not worth it. And if youre going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and youre going to give her another four years, thats why Im speaking out as strongly as I am about that.Hillary Clinton cannot be president. It will lead to even greater war in this world. And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.That makes the world less peaceful, less safe. In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.(APPLAUSE)Mr. Trump  Mr. Trump, your comments about banning Muslims from entering the country created a firestorm. According to Facebook, it was the most-talked-about moment online of your entire campaign, with more than 10 million people talking about the issue.Is there anything youve heard that makes you want to rethink this position?TRUMP: No.(LAUGHTER)No.(APPLAUSE)Look, we have to stop with political correctness. We have to get down to creating a country thats not going to have the kind of problems that weve had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the  with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world. I just left Indonesia  bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.We have to find out whats going on. I said temporarily. I didnt say permanently. I said temporarily. And I have many great Muslim friends. And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, Donald, thank you very much; youre exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it.And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of whats going on, he cant use the term for whatever reason. And if you cant use the term, youre never going to solve the problem. My Muslim friends, some, said, thank you very much; well get to the bottom of it.But we have a serious problem. And we cant be the stupid country any more. Were laughed at all over the world.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: Donald, Donald  can I  I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS. The Kurds are our strongest allies. Theyre Muslim. Youre not going to even allow them to come to our country?The other Arab countries have a role to play in this. We cannot be the worlds policeman. We cant do this unilaterally. We have to do this in unison with the Arab world. And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.(APPLAUSE)So I hope youll reconsider. I hope youll reconsider. The better way of dealing with this  the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the  Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, its harder if theyve been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder  make the screening take place.We dont have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously? What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?CAVUTO: But you said  you said that he made those comments and they represented him being unhinged after he made them.BUSH: Yeah, they are unhinged.CAVUTO: Well  well, after he made them...(APPLAUSE)... his poll numbers went up eight points in South Carolina. Now  now, wait...TRUMP: Eleven points, to be exact.CAVUTO: Are you  are you saying  are you saying that all those people who agree with Mr. Trump are unhinged?BUSH: No, not at all, absolutely not. I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically. I totally get that. But were running for the presidency of the United States here. This isnt  this isnt, you know, a different kind of job. You have to lead. You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, its just politics.Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength. And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why Im asking him to consider changing his views.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: I want security for this country. OK?(APPLAUSE)I want security. Im tired of seeing whats going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot. I want security for this country. We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam. We have a tremendous problem. Its not only a problem here. Its a problem all over the world.I want to find out why those two young people  those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them  people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them. I want to find out  many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment. Why werent they vigilant? Why didnt they call? Why didnt they call the police?And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country. I will tell you that.(APPLAUSE)The most mistreated people. In fact, we need to  wait a minute  we need vigilance. We have to find out  many people knew about what was going on. Why didnt they turn those two people in so that you wouldnt have had all the death?Theres something going on and its bad. And Im saying we have to get to the bottom of it. Thats all Im saying. We need security.BARTIROMO: We  we want to hear from all of you on this. According to Pew Research, the U.S. admits more than 100,000 Muslim immigrants every single year on a permanent lifetime basis. I want to ask the rest of you to comment on this. Do you agree that we should pause Muslim immigration until we get a better handle on our homeland security situation, as Mr. Trump has said?Beginning with you, Governor Kasich.KASICH: I  Ive been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees. And the reasons why Ive done is I dont believe we have a good process of being able to vet them. But you know, we dont want to put everybody in the same category. And Ill go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago. If were going to have a coalition, were going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states. We need Jordan.We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.(BELL RINGS)It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and were going to need it again. And if we try to put everybody in the same  call everybody the same thing, we cant do it. And thats just not acceptable.But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir, we want to hear from the rest of you,Governor Christie, your take.CHRISTIE: Now Maria, listen. I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind. And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe. Thats the end of the conversation.I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue. Heres the way you need to deal with it. You cant just ban all Muslims. You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists. You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.(BELL RINGS)And this summer, we didnt do that. We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president. Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if Im president, well make our intelligence community strong, and wont have to keep everybody out, were just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they dont harm us.BARTIROMO: Senator Rubio, where do you stand?RUBIO: Well, first of all, lets understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger thats out there about this whole issue. Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck. They are much more than that. This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region. This is not some small scale group.They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world. So you know what needs to happen, its a very simple equation, and its going to happen when Im president. If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Senator Cruz, where do you stand? Senator Cruz?CRUZ: You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism. What should we do? First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation Ive introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: And secondly, we should pass the legislation that Ive introduced...(BELL RINGS)... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory. Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.If Im elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida. When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS(APPLAUSE).BARTIROMO: Dr. Carson, where do you stand? Do you agree with Mr. Trump?CARSON: Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem. But like all of our problems, there isnt a single one that cant be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics. And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that. And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place. They have infrastructure. All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November. Lets listen to them and lets not listen to our politicians.BARTIROMO: So, to be clear, the both of you do not agree with Mr. Trump?BUSH: So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies  that we need to build better relationships with? Of course not. What we need to do is destroy ISIS.I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a No Fly Zone and Safe Zones to make sure refugees are there. We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria. We need to embed with  with the Iraqi military. We need to arm the Kurds the directly. We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters. Thats how you solve the problem. You dont solve it by big talk where youre banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.BARTIROMO: Thank you governor.CAVUTO: Mr. Trump, sometimes maybe in the heat of the campaign, you say things and you have to dial them back. Last week, the New York Times editorial board quoted as saying that you would oppose, up to 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods.TRUMP: Thats wrong. They were wrong. Its the New York Times, they are always wrong.CAVUTO: Well...TRUMP: They were wrong.CAVUTO: You never said because they provided that...TRUMP: No, I said,  I would use   they were asking me what to do about North Korea. China, they dont like to tell us but they have total control  just about, of North Korea. They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.They say,  well, we dont really have control. Without China, North Korea doesnt even eat. China is ripping us on trade. Theyre devaluing their currency and theyre killing our companies. Thousands of thousands  you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that weve lost  50,000 because of China.(CROSSTALK) CAVUTO: So theyve never said to put a tariff on their...TRUMP: Weve lost anywhere between four and seven million jobs because of China. What I said then was, we have very unfair trade with China. Were going to have a trade deficit of 505 billion dollars this year with China. A lot of that is because they devalue their currency.What I said to the New York Times, is that, we have great power, economic power over China and if we wanted to use that and the amount  where the 45 percent comes in, that would be the amount they saw their devaluations that we should get. That we should get.What Im saying is this, Im saying that we do it but if they dont start treating us fairly and stop devaluing and let their currency rise so that our companies can compete and we dont lose all of these millions of jobs that were losing, I would certainly start taxing goods that come in from China. Who the hell has to lose 505 billion dollars a year?CAVUTO: Im sorry, you lost me.TRUMP: Its not that complicated actually.CAVUTO: Then I apologize. Then I want to understand, if you dont want a 45 percent tariff, say that wasnt the figure, would you be open  are you open to slapping a higher tariff on Chinese goods of any sort to go back at them?TRUMP: OK, just so you understand  I know so much about trading about with China. Carl Icahn today as you know endorsed. Many businessmen want to endorse me.CAVUTO: I know...TRUMP: Carl said, no, no   but hes somebody  these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who dont know what theyre doing and we have problems like this. If these are the kinds of people  we should use our best and our finest.Now, on that tariff  heres what Im saying, China  they send their goods and we dont tax it  they do whatever they want to do. They do whatever what they do, OK. When we do business with China, they tax us. You dont know it, they tax us.I have many friends that deal with China. They cant  when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed. If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal  so we dont have an equal playing field. Im saying, absolutely, we dont have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.Im a free trader. I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate. I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine. I sell tens of millions of (inaudible).I love China. I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they cant believe how stupid the American leadership is.CAVUTO: So youre open to a tariff?TRUMP: Im totally open to a tariff. If they dont treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed. You cant deal in China without tariffs. They do it to us, we dont it. Its not fair trade.KASICH: Neil, Neil  can I say one thing about this. Im a free trader. I support NAFTA. I believe in the PTT because its important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China. And we do need China  Donalds right about North Korea.I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they dont proliferate all these dangerous materials. But what hes touching  talking about, I think has got merit. And Ill allow putting that tariff or whatever hes saying here...TRUMP: Im happy to have him tonight...(LAUGHTER)KASICH: For too long  no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our peoples jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us. And guess what? The workers out of a job.So when they  be found against that country thats selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker? Oh, well, you know, it just didnt work out for you.I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade. And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need  we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.And I want to just suggest to you. How do I know this? Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didnt work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar. And the fact is those jobs are critical, theyre hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because theyre Americans and they carry the load. So lets demand open trade but fair trade in this country. Thats what I think we need to do.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: All right.RUBIO: But on this point, if I may add something on this point. We are all frustrated with what China is doing. I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and heres why.China doesnt pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff. If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and theres a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.It begins with tax reform. Lets not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world. Lets allow companies to immediately expense.(APPLAUSE)It continues with regulatory reform. Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.How about Obamacare, a certified job killer? It needs to be repealed and replaced. And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger. That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.TRUMP: Neil, the problem BARTIROMO: Were getting TRUMP:  with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, theyre sucking us dry and it takes too long. It would just  you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money. We just cant do it any longer.CAVUTO: He is right. If you put a tariff on a good, its Americans who pay.BUSH: Absolutely.TRUMP: You looking at me?BUSH: Yeah.BARTIROMO: Prices go higher for TRUMP: Can I tell you what? It will never happen because theyll let their currency go up. Theyre never going to let it happen.Japan, the same thing. They are devaluing  its so impossible for  you look at Caterpillar Tractor and whats happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph). Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan. Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because theyve de-valued the yen to such an extent that you cant buy a Caterpillar tractor. And were letting them get away with it and we cant let them get away with it.And thats why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: Heres  apart from the  apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.BARTIROMO: Yeah.BUSH: So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes  the equivalent of it goes to China. Or how about Boeing right here within a mile? Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldnt retaliate and start buying Airbus? Of course, they would. This would be devastating for the economy. We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.BARTIROMO: Real quick, Senator  go ahead, Senator Cruz.(APPLAUSE)And then we have to get to tax reform.TRUMP: And we dont need a weak person being president of the United State, OK? Because thats what wed get if it were Jeb  I tell you what, we dont need that.AUDIENCE: Boo.TRUMP: We dont need that. Thats essentially what we have now, and we dont need that. And thats why were in the trouble that were in now. And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look. They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China. They dont want them made here. They want those planes made in China.BUSH: Theyre a mile away from here.TRUMP: Thats not the way the game is supposed to be played.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Governor Bush. Thank you, Mr. Trump. Very briefly.BUSH: My name was mentioned. My name was mentioned here. The simple fact is that the plane thats being build here is being sold to China. You can  if you  you flew in with your 767, didnt you? Right there, right next to the plant.TRUMP: No, the new planes. Im not talking about now, Im talking about in the future theyre building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Mr. Trump.BUSH: When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the BARTIROMO: Thank you, Mr. Trmup. Thank you, Governor.TRUMP: Ill check for you.BUSH: Check it out.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Senator briefly.CRUZ: Thanks for coming back to me, Maria. Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground. Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere. They discussed how  how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers. Theyre protectionist.But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, theyll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan Ive introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...(APPLAUSE)... and heres the critical point, Maria  the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and theyre border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.Its tax-free  a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers  and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax. Its like a tariff, but heres the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so theres no reciprocal...(BELL RINGS)... tariffs that come against us. It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...(UNKNOWN): Maria...CRUZ: ... and as president, Im going to fight for the working men and women.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Weve got to get to tax reform, gentlemen. Weve got to get to tax reform, and weve got to get to the...(UNKNOWN): Yeah, but I want to talk about taxes.BARTIROMO: ... weve got to get to the national debt as well. Coming up next, the growing national debt, the war on crime, tax reform. More from North Charleston, South Carolina, when we come right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate here in North Charleston. Right back to the questions.(APPLAUSE)Governor Christie, we have spoken much about cutting spending, given the $19 trillion debt. But according to one report, America needs $3.6 trillion in infrastructure spending by 2020.Here in South Carolina, 11 percent of bridges are considered structurally deficient, costing drivers a billion dollars a year in auto repairs. What is your plan to fix the ailing roads and bridges without breaking the bank?CHRISTIE: Well, Im glad you asked that, Maria. Heres  heres our plan. Weve all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world  and we double tax, as you know.And what thats led to over $2 trillion of American companies monies that are being kept offshore, because they dont want to pay the second tax. And who can blame them? They pay tax once overseas. They dont want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given  bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.Bring the money  the $2 trillion  back to the United States. Well tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money. And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.It would not necessitate us raising any taxes. It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about. And  and  and the last piece of this, Maria, is this. You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America. Hes penalized  and doesnt understand. In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.Youve seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration. Thats wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country. Wed rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and wed work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.And remember this  Im credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that Ive vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history. We dont need to raise taxes to get this done.We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir. Dr. Carson...(APPLAUSE)... it is true U.S. companies have $2 trillion in cash sitting overseas right now. That could be used for investment and jobs in America.Also, several companies right now are pursuing mergers to move their corporate headquarters abroad, and take advantage of much lower taxes. What will you do to stop the flow of companies building cash away from America, and those leaving America altogether?CARSON: Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and thats what we have proposed. A flat tax for everybody  no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money. You know, I  my  my mother taught me this. You know, she only had a third-grade education, but  you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldnt make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car. In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation. But...(LAUGHTER)... you know, the  the  the fact of the matter is  you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations  because every regulation is a tax, its a  on goods and services. And its the most regressive tax there is.You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up  you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that. A rich person does not. Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our  our  our people like this. And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say its those evil rich people.Its not the evil rich people. Its the evil government that is  that is putting all these regulations on us so that we cant survive.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.Senator Rubio...TRUMP: Maria  Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion. Its one of the biggest problems our country has. Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs  leave them behind. Theyre leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they cant get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in. But they cant get along. They cant even make a deal.Here is the case, they both agree, they cant make a deal. We have to do something. Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have. So many companies are going to leave our country.BARTIROMO: Which is why we raised it.Senator Rubio?Thank you, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Thank you.BARTIROMO: One of the biggest fiscal challenges is our entitlement programs, particularly Social Security and Medicare. What policies will you put forward to make sure these programs are more financially secure?RUBIO: Well, first let me address the tax issue because its related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: Here is the one thing Im not going to do. Im not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan. Its called the value added tax. And its a tax you find in many companies in Europe.Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.And thats why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, thats what Ronald Reagan said. Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.Now, you can support one now thats very low. But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors. Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job. And therefore, they dont get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.When I am president of the United States, Im going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you senator.CRUZ: Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.BARTIROMO: Senator Cruz, yes. You were meant to. Yes, of course.CRUZ: Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat. A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.This is a business flat tax. It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax. It goes away. It enables us to eliminate the death tax.If youre a farmer, if youre a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone. We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes. And listen, there is a real difference between Marcos tax plan and mine.Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent. Marcos top tax rate is 35 percent. My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS. Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity. We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...(BELL RINGS)... the mandates and have a simple flat tax. The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan. I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagans chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.BARTIROMO: Thank you senator.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: But thats not an accurate description of the plan. Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency thats going to collect your vat tax. Someones going to be collecting this tax.In fact, Ronald Reagans treasury, when Ronald Reagans treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found? That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax. Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make. They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.So there are people watching tonight in business. If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from? Youre going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you dont see it on the bill.And thats why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold. You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government. Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at. But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...(BELL RINGS)and they decide, were going to raise it to 30 percent, plus were going to raise the income tax to 30 percent. Now, youve got Europe.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Thank you senator. I have to get to a question for Mr. Trump.CRUZ: Maria...BARTIROMO: Yes.CRUZ: Maria, Id just like to say...(CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE: Maria, Id like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements. Do you remember that, everybody? This was a question on entitlements.And the reason  and the reason...(CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE: ... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it. Heres the thing.(CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE: The fact is, the reason why...RUBIO: If youll answer the (inaudible) core question.CHRISTIE: ... the fact is  the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because its hard. Its a hard problem. And Im the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this  avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes. Bernie Sanders has already said it. And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than shes moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress  this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund. A Republican Congress did that.And the fact is it was wrong. And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security. We need to reform Social Security. Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and thats why Im answering your question.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Governor. Thank you, Governor.(APPLAUSE) CARSON: Can I just add one very quick thing? And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan. And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best. Just want to get that out there, just saying.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Dr. Carson.Coming up, how would the candidates protect America, and another terror attack, if we were to see it. But first, you can join us live on stage during the commercial break right from home. Go to facebook.com/foxbusiness. Well be streaming live and answering your questions during this break next.More from South Carolina coming up. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Mr. Trump, your net worth is in the multi-billions of dollars and have an ongoing thriving hotel and real estate business. Are you planning on putting your assets in a blind trust should you become president? With such vast wealth, how difficult will it be for you to disentangle yourself from your business and your money and prioritize Americas interest first?TRUMP: Well, its an interesting question because Im very proud of my company. As you too know, I know I built a very great company. But if I become president, I couldnt care less about my company. Its peanuts.I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again. I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there. Run the company kids, have a good time. Im going to do it for America.So I would  I would be willing to do that.BARTIROMO: So youll put your assets in a blind trust?TRUMP: I would put it in a blind trust. Well, I dont know if its a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it. If thats a blind trust, I dont know. But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldnt ever be involved because I wouldnt care about anything but our country, anything.BARTIROMO: Thank you sir.TRUMP: Thank you.CAVUTO: Governor Christie, going back to your U.S. Attorney days, you had been praised by both parties as certainly a tough law and order guy. So I wonder what you make of recent statistics that showed violent crimes that have been spiking sometimes by double digit ratings in 30 cities across the country. Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn said, most local law enforcement officials feel abandoned by Washington. Former NYC Police Chief Ray Kelly, says that, police are being less proactive because theyre being overly scrutinized and second guessed and theyre afraid of being sued or thrown in jail.What would you do as president to address this?CHRISTIE: Well, first off, lets face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey. He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan. He said, theres a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country. Heres why, the president of the United States and both his attorneys general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.Thats the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president. Every time hes got a chance, going all the way back to  remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time. This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey. I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and heres the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country. Thats where crime is happening in these cities where they dont enforce the immigration laws. And this president turns his back  this president doesnt enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesnt agree with them.And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance thats illegal. This president allows lawlessness throughout this country. Heres what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General. Id say, General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively. Make our streets safe again. Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them.We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well. Im the only person on this stage whos done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.CAVUTO: Thank you governor.Governor Kasich, as someone has to deal with controversial police shootings in your own state, what do you make of Chicagos move recently to sort of retrain police? Maybe make them not so quick to use their guns?KASICH: Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat. She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety. KASICH: And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.KASICH: And they came back with 23 recommendations. One of them is a statewide use of deadly force. And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio. Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for  for training.But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police. Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not  not to lose their life. Their family is waiting for them.At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesnt work for them, but works against them.See, in Ohio, weve had some controversial decisions. But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong. And it has been a remarkable situation in our state. And as president of the United States, its all about communication, folks. Its all about getting people to listen to one anothers problems.And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have. Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed. Ive heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but Ive got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you cant do it alone. Youve got to bring people together. Youve got to give people hope.And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America. And that is whats so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Thank you, Governor.BARTIROMO: Senator Rubio?(APPLAUSE)Under current law, the U.S. is on track to issue more new permanent immigrants on green cards over the next five years than the entire population of South Carolina. The CBO says your 2013 immigration bill would have increased green cardholders by another 10 million over 10 years.Why are you so interested in opening up borders to foreigners when American workers have a hard enough time finding work?RUBIO: Well, first of all, this is an issue thats been debated now for 30 years. And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone whos in this country, maybe theyre here illegally, but theyre looking for a job. This issue is not about that anymore.First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe. And heres why. There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system. And not just green cards. Theyre looking  theyre recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances. They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.Theyre looking  theyre looking to manipulate our  the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States. So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States. So whether its green cards or any other form of entry into America, when Im president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.BARTIROMO: So your thinking has changed?RUBIO: The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago. Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally. They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS. Because theyre recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees. We know this for a fact. Theyve contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border. And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when Im president we will.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Senator.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida. We had Boko Haram. We had Hamas. We had Hezbollah. We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America. Its the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like its clear now, that border security is national security.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, Senator.CRUZ: It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obamas power to let in Syrian refugees. It enabled him  the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.I think thats a mistake. Thats why Ive been leading the fight to stop it. And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries. I voted yes to suspend that. Marco voted on the other side. So you dont get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.RUBIO: Maria, let me clear something up here. This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration. RUBIO: Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that youre against it. You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that youre against it. You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say youre against it. You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.And by the way, its not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say youre against it. I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.(APPLAUSE)That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation. When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant. Edward Snowden is a traitor. And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.(APPLAUSE)And one more point, one more point. Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it. Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.Heres the bottom line, and Ill close with this. If Im president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: Theres  look, theres CAVUTO: Gentlemen, gentlemen CRUZ: Im going to get a response to that, Neil. Theres no way he launches 11 attack CAVUTO: Very quick, very quick. CRUZ: Im going to  he had no fewer than 11 attacks there. I appreciate your dumping your (inaudible) research folder on the debate stage.RUBIO: No, its your record.CRUZL But I will say CAVUTO: Do you think they like each other?CRUZ:  at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false. Theyre absolutely false.AUDIENCE: Boo.CRUZ: So lets start  lets start with immigration. Lets start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity. Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty. I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King. Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals. I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion. What he said, and he said it in the last debate, its simply not true. And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.CAVUTO: All right, gentlemen, weve got to stop. I know you are very passionate about that.(APPLAUSE)Governor Bush, fears have gripped this country obviously, and you touched on it earlier since the San Bernardino attacks. Since our last debate, the national conversation has changed, according to Facebook data as well.Now this first graphic shows the issues that were most talked about right before those attacks and now after: the issues of Islam, homeland security and ISIS now loom very large. The FBI says Islamic radicals are using social media to communicate and that it needs better access to communication. Now the CEO of Apple, Governor, Tim Cook said unless served with a warrant private communication is private, period. Do you agree, or would you try to convince him otherwise?BUSH: I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators  back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country. We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff CAVUTO: Would you answer this question?BUSH: Oh, Ill talk about that, too. But you havent asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought Id get that off my chest if you dont mind.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO: Fair enough. So Tim Cook  so Tim Cook says hes going to keep it private.BUSH: I got that. And the problem today is theres no confidence in Washington, D.C. There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies. They understand that theres a national security risk. We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, theyre not fearful of a lawsuit.We need to make sure that we keep the country safe. This is the first priority. The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely. Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is  that is just shameful. 23 million files in the hands of the Chinese? So its not just the government  the private sector companies, its also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well. That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.CAVUTO: But if Tim cook is telling you no, Mr. President.BUSH: Youve got to keep asking. Youve got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue. If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship CAVUTO: Do you ask or do you order? BUSH: Well, if the law would change, yeah. But I think there has to be recognition that if we  if we are too punitive, then youll go to other  other technology companies outside the United States. And what we want to do is to control this.We also want to dominate this from a commercial side. So theres a lot of balanced interests. But the president leads in this regard. Thats what we need. We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when youre talking about amendments that dont even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.CAVUTO: Governor, thank you.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: When we come right back, closing statements. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Candidates, it is time for your closing statements. You get 60 seconds each.Governor John Kasich, we begin with you.KASICH: You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just dont have the power. You know, they feel like if they dont have a lobbyist, if theyre not wealthy, that somehow they dont get to play.But all of my career, you know, having been raised in  by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English. You see, all of my career, Ive fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.Whether its welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether its engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether its taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.Look, thats who I stand up for. Thats whos in my mind(BELL RINGS)And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because youre the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Governor Bush?BUSH: Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer? Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan Ive laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.Credibility counts. Therell be people here that will talk about what theyre going to do. Ive done it. I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Governor Chris Christie?CHRISTIE: Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week  the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way theyre feeling.They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore. They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesnt understand their pain, and doesnt have any plan for getting away from it.I love this country. Its the most exceptional country the world has ever known. We need someone to fight for the people. We need a fighter for this country again.Ive lived my whole life fighting  fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.But heres the best way that were going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Dr. Ben Carson?CARSON: You know, in recent travels around this country, Ive encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.Were not going to solve this problem with traditional politics. The only way were going to solve this problem is with we, the people. And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity. Bencarson.com  we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Senator Marco Rubio?RUBIO: You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights dont come from government. Our rights come from God.Thats why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world. Thats why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel. This country is changing. It feels different. We feel like were being left behind and left out.And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasnt interested in fixing America. We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military. And thats why 2016 is a turning point in our history. If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.But if we elect the right person  if you elect me  we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Senator Ted Cruz?CRUZ: 13 Hours  tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them. I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, whos responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter. This will end. It will end on January 2017.And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Mr. Donald Trump?TRUMP: I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers. Theyre tough, theyre strong, theyre great people. Half of them had tears pouring down their face. They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads. It was a terrible sight. A terrible sight. And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion. If Im president, there wont be stupid deals anymore.We will make America great again. We will win on everything we do. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Candidates, thank you.CAVUTO: Gentlemen, thank you all. All of you. That wraps up our debate. We went a little bit over here. But we wanted to make sure everyone was able to say their due. Hes upset. All right. Thank you for joining us. Much more to come in the Spin Room ahead.'

aS'Following is a transcript of the preliminary Republican debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.ANNOUNCER: Tonight, the Republican candidates for president are looking to capture their moment. South Carolina has a history of making and breaking campaigns. And this week Charleston is the center of the political universe. Three days from now, the Democrats will debate just a few miles away.Here, in a city older than the country itself, from the Revolutionary War to the Civil War, to the war by the shore, South Carolina prepares once again to take center stage. And the Republican candidates all hope that the spotlight of the Palmetto State would shine upon them.(APPLAUSE)TRISH REGAN, CO-MODERATOR: Good evening, and welcome to the North Charleston Coliseum and Performing Arts Center. Tonight we hear from 10 Republican candidates vying to become the next president of the United States.Im Trish Regan, along with my co-moderator Sandra Smith.SANDRA SMITH, CO-MODERATOR: This evening FOX Business is bringing you the sixth Republican presidential debate of the 2016 campaign. For the next hour, three of the candidates will be answering the questions voters want answered.REGAN: So lets introduce them. Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: And former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: This debate will last one hour. Each candidate will have up to 90 seconds to respond to each question, one minute for each follow-up.REGAN: When your time is up, you are going to hear this bell.(BELL RINGS)REGAN: All right. So lets begin.In Tuesdays State of the Union Address, the president said that our economy is strong. He cited the significant decline weve seen in unemployment rate and the millions of jobs that have been created.What is your assessment of the economy right now? And I would like to hear from all of you on this one, beginning with Ms. Fiorina.CARLY FIORINA (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, thank you. Good evening. If I may begin by saying how honored I am to be standing here with two former Iowa Caucus winners.Governor, Senator.And how honored I am to be talking with all of you. You know, Im not a political insider. I havent spent my lifetime running for office. The truth is I have had and been blessed by a lot of opportunities to do a lot of things in my life.And unlike another woman in this race, I actually love spending time with my husband.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: Im standing here because I think we have to restore a citizen government in this country. I think we have to end crony capitalism. The crony capitalism that starts with both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.You know, Hillary Clinton sits inside government and rakes in millions, handing out access and favors. And Donald Trump sits outside government and rakes in billions buying people like Hillary Clinton.The state of our economy is not strong. We have record numbers of men out of work. We have record numbers of women living in poverty. We have young people who no longer believe that the American dream applies to them.We have working families whose wages have stagnated for decades, all while the rich get richer, the powerful get more powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected get more connected.Citizens, its time to take our country back.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Governor Huckabee, same question to you. Where do you see the country right now?MIKE HUCKABEE (R), FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I wish I saw the country in the same place that the president presented it to be the other night in the State of the Union. He talked about how great the economy was doing. And I guess for the people he hangs out with, its probably doing great.But the president shouldve stood in the line at the layaway counter at Walmart just before Christmas. He would have heard a very different story about the economy of America.HUCKABEE: I wish I could introduce him the lady who cleans the building where our campaign headquarters is located in Little Rock. Her name is Kathleen (ph). She works all day at a local hospital cleaning, and then she goes to the building where a bank, and our headquarters, and other offices are she spends another seven hours. She works 15 hours a day.I guarantee you shes not working 15 hours a day because she loves scrubbing toilets, and sweeping floors. Shes working that many hours because thats what it takes for her to make it work.And, shes not alone. There are people all over this country who are working like that. Many of them working two jobs  and they used to have one job, and that would take care of them. But, because of wage stagnation, which weve had for 40 years, because the fact that theyre punished for working harder if they work that many hours. The government gets more of their second shift than they do.And, as a result there are a lot of people who are hurting today. I wish the President knew more of them. He might make a change in the economy and the way hes managing it.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you Governor Huckabee. Senator Santorum?SANTORUM: Well, all he has to do is listen to the Democratic debate and find out how bad the economy is. All they do is complain about the hollowing out of the middle of America, and how America is struggling so badly, and have to make these radical changes in Washington.But theyve been in control for the last seven years, and what have we seen? The most important jobs, I believe, in this country are the ones that fill the middle. For the 74% of Americans who dont have a college degree between the age of 25 and 65 are manufacturing jobs. Your governor, and your legislature, and your team here have done an amazing job of bringing manufacturing jobs back to South Carolina.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)SANTORUM: Right here. Right here in Charleston, right down in the street in Boeing (ph). Youve done a great job, and whats happened? Youve grown this economy, youve strengthened the center of your state, the middle. Thats because you know that if youre really going to create wealth and opportunity, you got to get jobs, and good paying jobs for everybody.And, so whats happened? Two million jobs, manufacturing jobs, have left this country because of Barack Obama. Regulations, EPA, workplace regulations, things driving people off-shore all because of his number one priority, global climate change.Well, let me tell you this, Mr. President. For every dollar of GDP, China creates five times as much pollution as we do here. You want to  lower global climate change, bring those jobs back to America and let American workers do that job with less pollution.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Thank you, Senator Santorum. Thank you, candidates.Moving to the world stage. The middle east is on the brink of chaos. Iran continues to provoke the United States, North Korea claims its tested a hydrogen bomb, and Afghanistan is in danger of falling back into Taliban hands. Critics of the administration say its all due to lack of U.S. leadership.To you, Mrs. Fiorina, how do you see Americas role in the world today?FIORINA: America must lead because when we do not lead, when this exceptional nation does not lead, the world is more dangerous and a more tragic place.Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, they all refuse to lead. Worse, they refuse to respond when this nation is provoked. Hillary Clinton famously asked what difference does it make how four Americans died in Benghazi?Mrs. Clinton, heres what difference it makes. When you do not stand up and say the truth, that this was a purposeful terrorist attack, when you do not say the United States of America will retaliate for that attack, terrorists assume its open season.We have refused to respond to every provocation. The President wouldnt even mention the fact that Iran had taken two Navy boats and our sailors  hostage. He didnt mention the fact that they violated the Geneva convention. He didnt respond to the fact that Iran launched two ballistic missile just a short time ago, in direct violation of a deal they had just signed. We didnt respond to the fact that North Korea attacked Sony Pictures.When we refuse to respond over, and over to provocation and bad behavior, we will get more provocation and bad behavior. I know most of our allies personally. I have met many of our adversaries. I know our military and our intelligence capability, and I know this. When we will not stand with our allies, when we will not respond to our adversaries, when we do not lead in the world the world is a dangerous and tragic place. I will be a Commander in Chief who will lead.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Well, since weve been talking about the Middle East, Senator Santorum, conflicts between Saudi Arabia and Iran have certainly escalated, amid accusations that Saudi Arabia bombed the Iranian Embassy in Yemen after the Saudi Embassy in Tehran was attacked.As we confront an increasingly unstable Middle East, how will you, as president, navigate this administrations promises to Iran while standing by our historic allies in the region?RICK SANTORUM (R-PA), FORMER SENATOR, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, the historic promises that we have made to  to Iran in this agreement need to be torn up on the first day in office of the next president.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: And let me tell you why, because Iran has already torn it up. Iran has not approved the agreement that President Obama has said that they have approved. They have approved a different agreement in their parliament.The fact of the matter is they have violated this agreement. Carly just mentioned some of those violations.They have launched ballistic missiles, tested them, in clear violation.And heres the pathetic part. The president announced that they were going to impose sanctions. And then President Rouhani went on Twitter and said there would be retaliation.And what did we do?We backed down.Ladies and gentlemen, there are 50 some Citadel cadets in this audience tonight.(APPLAUSE) SANTORUM: I would ask them to stand up if they will. And heres what I want to tell each and every one of them, as you stand. Heres what I want to tell them.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: Whether its youre watching that movie this weekend that just came out when we abandoned our men and women in Benghazi, or whether its we treat Iran, that gave courtesies to our sailors, as they made them record a hostage video, let me tell you this, if you choose to serve this country, I will have your back. I will not let America be trampled upon anymore by these radical jihadists.REGAN: Thank you, Senator Santorum.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Governor Huckabee, in Afghanistan, the Taliban is strengthening. Attacks are on the rise and thousands more civilians have been wounded or killed. Much of the Taliban surge can be attributed to the withdrawal of U.S. forces there.You have expressed skepticism with the war there, saying you see no end game in sight.What, then, is your solution to the growing conflict there?MIKE HUCKABEE (R-AK), FORMER GOVERNOR, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Let me put that in context. When I went to Afghanistan, I saw a land that looked like the land of the Flintstones. It was desolate. It was barren. It was primitive.And its been that way for thousands of years. They want to take the world back to be just like that.We dont.We need to make a clear goal as to why we want to be anywhere in the Middle East, and Ill tell you why we want to be and need to be, is to destroy radical Islam and everything that threatens civilization. Its not just a threat...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE:  to Israel or to America, its a threat to every civilized person on this Earth. And we need to be equipping not only the Kurds in Iraq, we need to be making sure that those who are willing to fight radical Muslims will do it, but we need to never ever spend a drop of American blood unless there is a clearly defined goal and we cant make sure we win unless we have a military thats the strongest in the history of mankind.Weve got to rebuild our navy. Its the smallest navy weve had since 1915, when my grandfather got on a destroyer in World War I when he was in the U.S. Navy. Weve got young men in Air Force B-52s, one in particular, hes flying a B-52 that his father flew in the 80s and his grandfather flew in the 50s. Those planes are older than me.Weve got to have a military that the world is afraid of, use it sparingly, but when we do, the whole world will know that America is on their tail and they will be on their tail on the ground, never ever to rise up again.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Governor Huckabee, if I could just follow-up with that.Do we need to be in Afghanistan?HUCKABEE: Only if there is a concerted effort to destroy the advance of radical Islamists who are against us. As far as what are we going to make it look like. Frankly, I dont know what we can make it look like. You cant create for other people a desire for freedom and democracy.And frankly, that is not the role of the United States. The role of the United States military is not to build schools, it is not to build bridges, it is not to go around and pass out food packets.It is to kill and destroy our enemy and make America safe and that is the purpose we should be there if were going to be there.REGAN: Thank you Governor Huckabee.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Ms. Fiorina, nearly 600 women say they were attacked in a German city on New Years Eve by men of Arab or North African descent and 45 percent of those alleged attacks were sexual assaults. Twenty-two of those 32 men arrested so far are asylum-seekers. Are you worried about similar problems in the United States?FIORINA: Of course Im worried about similar problems in the United States. We can not allow refugees to enter this country unless we can adequately vet them and we know we cant. Therefore we should stop allowing refugees into this country.(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: And by the way, we do not need to be lectured about why were angry and frustrated and fearful because weve had an illegal immigration problem in this country for 25 years.(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: And we have every right to be frustrated about the fact that politicians stand up in election after election after election and promise us to fix the problem and yet, it has never been fixed.I offer leadership that understands that actions speak louder than words, that results count. We must secure our border. We must fix our broken immigration system. We must enforce a pro-American immigration system that serves our interests, not the rest of the world. I understand what it takes to translate goals into results and that is what I will do as president of the United States. Of course, we should be worried, for heavens sakes.This administration has now told us they dont know who has overstayed a visa. This administration has told us they dont even bother to check Facebook or Twitter to find out whos pledging allegiance to jihadis. We can do better than this, citizens. We need to take our country back.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: I want to stay with you on this. The world shares a common enemy right now in the way of ISIS. Russia, the European Union, Saudi Arabia, Iran, China, we all agree ISIS is a threat and it must be stopped.During World War II, the world partnered with Joseph Stalin, who was arguably one of the most formidable  despicable figures of the 20th century. But they partnered with him to fight the Nazis.Today, everyone seems to agree we need some kind of coalition to fight ISIS. Do you agree with that? And if so, would your coalition include possibly, Russia and Iran?FIORINA: We need to be very clear-eyed now about who are our allies and who are our adversaries. In the fight against ISIS, Saudi Arabia is our ally. Iran is our adversary. And despite Donald trumps bromance with Vladmir Putin, Vladmir Putin and Russia are our adversary. We can not...(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: We can not outsource leadership in the Middle East to Iran and Russia. We must stand and lead. The Kuwaitis, the Jordanians, the Saudis, Egyptians, Bahrainis (sic), the Emirates, the Kurds. I know virtually all of these nations and their leaders. And they have asked us for very specific kinds of support: bombs, material, arms, intelligence.We are not providing any of it today. I will provide all of it. We have allies who will stand up and help us deny ISIS territory, which is what we must do to defeat them. We must deny them territory. They will help us do this. And yes, we need a coalition.But only in the United States of America can lead such a coalition. I will lead it. But we must be clear-eyed through this fight. Iran is our adversary. Russia is our adversary. We can never outsource our leadership. Only the United States of America can lead to defeat ISIS. I will.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Ms. Fiorina, thank you.SMITH: All right, thank you, candidates. Were just getting started. Jobs, Homeland Security, gun rights, all those issues are coming up straight ahead. Were live from North Charleston and the Republican Presidential Debate. Well be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Welcome back, everyone, to the Republican presidential debate. On to the next round of questions  Sandra.SMITH: All right, lets get started. Senator Santorum, to you first. President Obama has urged technology leaders to make it hard for terrorists to use technology to escape from justice. Hillary Clinton says social media companies can help by swiftly shutting down terrorist accounts.The companies say that theyre already working with law enforcement and any proposed legislation would do more harm than good. Should companies like Facebook and Twitter be required by law to more actively  be more actively engaged in fighting terror?SANTORUM: I would just say that if we were doing a better job within the government, we wouldnt need the private sector to do the things that were asking them to do.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: Ive had a little experience in this in the private sector myself. And what I found was a government with layers and layers of bureaucracy, of people who had some technical expertise but they had no authority, number one.And one of the things I found out about in the bureaucracy is if a lot of people have authority, nobody has authority, number one. And number two, that if you dont do anything, you dont get fired.Its only when you do something and something goes wrong, you get fired. So they do nothing. And thats what is happening in our Defense Department right now. We have a capability that theyre trying to develop to play defense.We have a lot of technologists that are very skilled. And theyre trying to figure out how to play defense. But what we dont have is we dont have folks who are thinking about offense.We dont have war-fighters. We have technologists. Technologists are not war-fighters. Technologists are thinking, how do I protect cyber-security, how do I secure, how do I protect?SANTORUM: And we need to have a much more dynamic, how do we  how do we go after them?How do we respond?And we need leadership thats willing to make sure that when someone attacks us  and ladies and gentlemen, theyre attacking us as we speak. Theyre attacking us all day every day, not just the government, but theyre attacking private sector companies all day every day.They have to learn that were going to pay  theyre going to pay a price when they do so.And then right now, just like in every other aspect of our national security, people who attack us are not paying a price. We need a leader who will make sure that they know when they mess with America, theyre going to pay a price.SMITH: Senator, would you  would you require anything of those companies like Facebook and Twitter if you were president?SANTORUM: Look, Facebook and Twitter can teach us things. We can cooperate with them. We can share ideas and information. But this is a  and this is a very dicey area for the government to go in and require the industry to do its job.It needs to develop that capability. We need to be  have responsible dialogue, but I dont think requirements are the order of the day.SMITH: Thank you, Senator.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Ms. Fiorina, the president has just issued an executive order to expand the gun laws and background checks. And none of you on stage agree with this.But recent polls show the majority of Americans are in favor of universal background checks.(BOOS)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not in this room.REGAN: Its the poll data.(CROSSTALK)FIORINA: And we all believe the polling data all the time, dont we?REGAN: So tell me...(APPLAUSE)REGAN:  why, in your view, is the presidents proposal a problem?FIORINA: Oh, its a problem for so many reasons.First of all, it is yet another lawless executive order. You see, he doesnt like the fact that Congress has rejected his ideas twice on a bipartisan basis, so hes decided he just gets to override them.Sorry, Mr. President, not the way The Constitution works.Secondly...(APPLAUSE)FIORINA:  secondly, he basically admitted in that speech that he hasnt been paying much attention to enforcing the laws we have. He said, gee, we need a few more FBI agents. That would have helped, perhaps, stop a tragedy here in South Carolina with Dylann Roof, a guy who clearly never should have been sold a gun.In other words, Mr. President, youre right, we need to enforce the laws we have. Lets enforce the laws we have. There are criminals running around with guns who shouldnt have them. We dont prosecute any of them. Less than 1 percent.But I want to go back to the technology issue for a moment, if I may, as well, because in this regard, I disagree with Senator Santorum. Look, I come from the technology industry and I can tell you there is one thing that bureaucracies dont know how to do. They do not know how to innovate.We have come seven generations of technology since 2011. We have bureaucracies that are incapable of bringing in that innovation.So, yes, there are some very specific things that we should ask the private sector to help us with, including making sure we have the latest and greatest in algorithms to search through all these databases so that we find terrorists before they attack us, not after its too late.And, finally, when a president who understands technology in the Oval Office. Mrs. Clinton, actually, you cannot wipe a server with a towel.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Ms. Fiorina, youve said that was when you were CEO of HP, you actually worked with the government.FIORINA: Yes, and see...REGAN:  to try and combat some of these terrorist threats.FIORINA: As CEO of Hewlett Packard...REGAN: What did you do?FIORINA: As CEO of Hewlett Packard, I was asked very specifically for some very real help. The help I was asked to provide, this is now public information. So I am not revealing what  something that was  was classified.We had a very large shipment of equipment, software and hardware, headed to a retail outlet. And I was called by the head of the NSA, who had an urgent need for that capability, to begin laying out a program to track terrorists.We turned that truck around on a highway and it was escorted to the headquarters in San Jose.In World War II, our government went to the private sector and said, help us do things that we cannot do.The private sector has capabilities that the government does not have. There are some legal authorities that are required.The Sony attack could have been detected and repelled, had legal authorities been passed in Congress allowing private networks and public networks to work together.Those legal authorities have not yet been passed.Yes, I was asked to help.(RINGS BELL)FIORINA: I know the technology industry. They will help again. But they must be asked by a president who understands what they have.REGAN: Ms. Fiorina, thank you.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: All right, Governor Huckabee, you called President Obamas executive orders on gun control unconstitutional and completely insane.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: (LAUGHING) Yes, I did.SMITH: You even told gun store owners to ignore the Presidents orders.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Yet, innocent people are dying from gun violence in cities like Detroit, Chicago, and Charleston everyday. Is there anything that can be done at the federal level to prevent guns from falling into the hands of criminals?HUCKABEE: Well, why dont we start by making sure the Justice Department never does an idiotic program like Fast and Furious where the U.S. Government put guns...(CHEERING)HUCKABEE: ...in the hands of Mexican drug lords...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: ...and end up killing one of our border agents. You know, they want to talk about law abiding citizens, I just find it amazing the President keeps saying the gun show loophole. There is no gun show loophole. I promise you Ive been to more gun shows than President Obama.SMITH: (LAUGHING)HUCKABEE: And, Ive bought more weapons at them, and you fill out forms. The President also says things that its easier to get a gun now than it is to grow trees. Again, I purchase guns, and I can assure you that it is much more difficult to purchase a firearm than it is to get the ingredients of a salad at the supermarket.What the President keeps pushing are ideas that have never worked. Ideas that would not have stopped San Bernadino, Sandy Hook, Aurora, and at some point you wonder if you keep retrying things that dont work, maybe we should just see if we could resell all those used lottery tickets that didnt work real well because thats the logic of just keep doing the same thing, but something that has failed. Of course, we want to stop gun violence, but the one common thing that has happened in most mass shootings is that they happened in gun- free zones where people who would have been law abiding citizens, who could have stood up and at least tried to stop it and were not allowed to under the law.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Thank you, Governor Huckabee.REGAN: Governor Huckabee, an American in San Bernardino murdered 14 people while terrorists with Belgian and French passports murdered 130 people. Were facing a threat within our borders, and from outside the United States. Those European terrorists, they could have come here at any time given that we have a visa waiver program that enables people to travel back and forth. It exists within those countries, and 36 others.In countries around the world, including many in Europe, cannot ensure that their citizens are not jihadists, why are we waiving the visa requirement at all?HUCKABEE: Well, we shouldnt be and thats one of the reasons that I think there a lot of voices in our country who are saying its time to relook (ph) at the visa program. The European Union is a failure, its not allowed for even the economic goals that they were trying to achieve.But, what were not seeing is that its making Europe less safe, and its proven not to be exactly what they all thought it was going to be.Our first and foremost responsibility in this country, and the first responsibility of the President of the United States is protect America, and protect Americans. We have a President who seems to be more interested in protecting the reputation and image of Islam than he is protecting us. And, I want to be very clear...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: ...that this President.(CHEERING)HUCKABEE: Makes comments like he did the other night, that we have to be so careful because we dont want to offend Muslims. He needs to read his own FBI crime stats from last year which would show him that of the hate crimes in the country, over 5,500, about 1,100 were religious hate crimes. And, of those, 58% were directed toward Jews. Only 16% directed toward Muslims.Maybe what the President should have talked about the other night is how we ought to be more careful in the anti-semitic comments that are going toward American Jews than toward Muslims because by three times as many...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: ...theyre being targeted for religious hate crime.REGAN: If you get the visa waiver program, does that shut down international commerce?HUCKABEE: It does not shut down international commerce, but it may slow it down. And, you dont want to slowdown commerce that is making us safer. Its worth it. This lady who came and joined with the San Bernardino killer had passed three background checks, and thats why a lot of Americans didnt buy it when the President said well bring in Syrian refugees, but dont worry well check them out.We have a lot of confidence in a president who told us that we could keep our doctor, we could keep our health insurance, and cost us less, and now the latest is if you like your gun you can keep it too, and frankly, we dont buy it. We dont believe it. Hes lost his credibility, and his inept...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: ...inability to work with Congress and pass legislation has led him to do what I never even imagined doing as a governor, and thats just going and doing it my own way.MOREHUCKABEE: Thats why we elect a president, is to lead, is to be able to shepherd things through. And if I can do it with a 90 percent Democrat legislature in Arkansas, there is no excuse for any president not being able to lead in Washington if he knows what the heck he is doing when he gets there.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you, Governor Huckabee.SMITH: Senator Santorum, many of our military leaders believe Americas critical infrastructure is vulnerable to a terrorist attack. This is the power in our homes, the water we drink, the Internet and phone systems by which we stay connected.If attacked, these essential services that underpin American society could come to a grinding halt. Do you have a specific plan to protect us from this type of attack?SANTORUM: Well, the most devastating attack that could occur is an electromagnetic pulse attack, and that would be an attack that would be triggered by a nuclear explosion in the upper atmosphere of our country.The best way to stop that from happening is to make sure that those who contemplating and actually war-gaming and talking about using it, Iran, doesnt get a nuclear weapon so they cant explode that device.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: And the president of the United States has put Iran on a path to a nuclear weapon. And we have done nothing to do anything to harden our grid. There is actually a bill in Congress that would put money forward to try to put redundancy and harden our electric grid so it could actually survive an EMP.An EMP is a devastating explosion that sends a pulse that knocks out all electric, everything, everything that is connected to any kind  that is wired, that has a circuit board gets fried out. Everything is gone. Cars stop. Planes fall out of the sky.This is a devastating attack. And this president has done nothing, number one, to take the most probable person to  probable country to launch an attack and stop them, and has done nothing to try to defend us, particularly our electric grid. The bottom line is, I put the original sanctions on the Iranian nuclear program when I was in the United States Senate. Ive been fighting for 12 years with one thing in mind, that we must stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. And...(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: Because theyre different than every other country. They do not want a nuclear weapon to defend themselves. They want a nuclear weapon to have theological ends to bring about their mahdi so they can control the world. And that is the most serious threat facing this country right now.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Senator Santorum, I want to stay with you on this, moving to jobs and the economy. In his State of the Union Address the other night, President Obama touted his record on jobs, citing more than 14 million new jobs and boasted of nearly 900,000 manufacturing jobs added in the past six years.Do you dispute his track record of creating jobs?SANTORUM: Well, the numbers just dont add up. I mean, they have not added manufacturing jobs. Manufacturing jobs have been lost in this country, 2 million of them. The bottom line is that this president has done more to take jobs away from the hard-working people who are struggling the most.And thats folks who are, as I said, the 74 percent of Americans who dont have a college degree. And theyre out there talking about, well, were going to provide free college for everybody. Well, who is going to pay for it? The 74 percent that dont have a college degree.Theyre not  nobody is focused. Lets just be honest, nobody is focused on the people who are struggling the most in America today. We talk about immigration. Talk about the presidents immigration plan. He wants to bring in more and more people into this country. Let people who are here illegally stay in this country.Almost all of the people who are here illegally, and most of the people who came here legally over the last 20 years, theyre working in wage-earning jobs. That is why wages have flat-lined.And we have unfortunately two political parties with most of the candidates in this field for some form of amnesty, some form of allowing people to stay here even though theyre here illegally and for increasing levels of legal immigration.Im someone who believes that we need to be the party that stands for the American worker. And when we say we need to send people back, I mean we send people back.And let me just make one point. I was in Storm Lake, Iowa, the other day, near a Tysons plant, 91 percent of the kids that go to the elementary school there are minority kids. And they said, well, what are you going to do with all of these people, their families, theyve lived here for a long time?I said, Im going to give them a gift. Im going to give them a gift of being able to help the country they were born in.Merge adds XXX were born in.SANTORUM: And Im going to export America, the education they were able to see. They learned English language. They learned about capitalism. They learned about democracy. You want to stop flow of immigrants?Lets send six million Mexicans, Hondurans, Guatemalans, El Savadorians...(BELL RINGS)... back into their country, so they can start a renaissance in their country so they wont be coming over here anymore.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Senator Santorum, thank you.SMITH: Governor Huckabee, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Admiral Mike Mullen, has said the greatest threat to our security is our national debt.Our national debt is now on pace to top $19 trillion. Yet, you as well as Ms. Fiorina have laid forward no plan to reform entitlements. How can you say youre going to pay down our countrys debt without cutting Social Security or Medicare?HUCKABEE: Well, first of all, lets just remember that Social Security is not the governments money, it belongs to the people who had it taken out of their checks involuntarily their entire working lives.(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: For the government to say, well it is fault of working people that we have a Social Security problem, no. It is the fault of a government that used those peoples money for something other than protecting those peoples accounts. So lets not blame them and punish them.(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: But here is a fact, and I sometimes hear Republicans say well, were going to have to cut this and extend the age. You know what I think a lot of times when I hear people say, well, lets make people work to their 70. That sounds great for white-collar people who sat at a desk most of their lives. You ever talk to somebody that stood on concrete floor for the first 40 years of their working life? Do you think they can stand another five years or 10 years, many of them will retired virtually crippled because they worked hard. And were going to punish them some more? I dont think so. Heres the fact.(APPLAUSE)HUCAKBEE: Four percent economic growth, we fully fund Social Security and Medicare. Our problem is not that Social Security is just too generous to seniors. It isnt. Our problem is that our politicians have not created the kind of policies that would bring economic growth.And I still support strongly that we get rid of the 77,000 pages of the monstrous tax code...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: ... pass the fair tax, supercharge this economy with the rocket fuel that happens with the consumption tax and we dont have to cut Social Security to any senior who has worked their lifetime for it.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you, Governor Huckabee.SMITH: OK. Were going to continue this conversation. Were taking a quick break and then coming up, the candidates plans for strengthening the middle class. Were live in North Charleston with the Republican Presidential Debate. Well be right back.MORE(APPLAUSE)(COMMERICAL BREAK)REGAN: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate live from North Charleston.We want to jump right back in.Sandra is kicking it off.SMITH: All right, thanks, Trish.Well, lets get started with Ms. Fiorina.Today, the middle class represents about 50 percent of the U.S. population, down from about 61 percent back in 1971. Thats according to Pew Research. The same research revealed a widening income gap in America. The rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer.What will you do to strengthen a middle class that is no longer the majority?FIORINA: For decades, the professional political class in both parties has been talking about the middle class. For decades, Republicans in particular have been talking about reducing the size and scope of government, spending less money, reducing the complexity.And yet, for 40 years, the government has gotten bigger and more expensive.We now have a 75,000 plus page tax code, although politicians have run for office for decades promising reform. And all the while, middle class incomes have stagnated.You see, when government gets bigger and bigger, more powerful, the rich get richer, the poor get poorer and the middle class gets squeezed.We need to understand who the job creators are in this country, because we need more jobs to grow the middle class and to grow the wages of the middle class.Who creates jobs?Small businesses, new businesses, family-owned businesses. (APPLAUSE)FIORINA: They create two thirds of the new jobs in this country and they employ half the people.I started out typing for a nine person real estate firm. My husband Frank started out driving a tow truck for a family-owned auto body shop. And we are crushing small businesses and destroying the middle class.So heres my blueprint to take back America. Let us first actually reform the tax code from 73,000 pages down to three. Theres a 20-year-old plan to do exactly that.And then let us begin piece by piece to focus on every single dollar the government spends, so that we will spend less overall and still have enough for our priorities. And that requires the government to budget the way you do at home  examine every dollar, cut any dollar, move any dollar. The fancy term for that is zero- based budgeting, but I call it common sense.Citizens, weve got to take our country back.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Governor Huckabee, you know it used to be you could graduate from high school and get a pretty good job at the local factory, enough to take care of your family and yourself. Those days seem to be gone. Its pretty hard to do that nowadays.Businesses are increasingly turning to automation to increase their productivity levels. Its happening right here, in fact, at the Boeing factory in North Charleston.The president says automation threatens workers ability to get higher wages.Do you agree with that?And if so, do you have a solution?HUCKABEE: Let me go back to the reason so many people are having a hard time getting ahead. The tax system punishes them.Think about this. If you work really hard and you start moving up the economic ladder, you get bumped into a different tax bracket. So the government thinks it deserves more of your hard work than you do.And its one of the reasons that no matter how many different reforms you have to a tax on peoples productivity, youre still taxing their work, their savings. Youre taxing their capital gains, inheritance, dividends, youre taxing everything that produces something.And its way I really believe its time to do something bold, not something minute. This is no time for a tap of the hammer, a twist of the screwdriver. Its time for something big. Thats why the fair tax transforms our economy.(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: And we dont punish workers. Its the only way were going to get middle class people moving ahead again, because the harder they work, the more they keep. No payroll tax deducted from their checks. They get their entire paycheck.(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: And, one of the most important parts, its built on the common sense with which we raised our kids, and trained dogs. You reward behavior you want more of. And, you punish behavior you want less of. Thats how I raise kids, its how I trained our dogs, and folks, its not that difficult.We now punish the behavior we say we want more of by taxing it, and we reward the behavior that we say we want less of, so if you make a good investment, we punish you with a tax. If you make a bad investment you can write that off and the rest of the taxpayers will help subsidize you, and bail you out.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you very much, Governor Huckabee.Senator Santorum, 40% of babies born today are born to single moms. Thats twice as high as reported back in 1980, and its 11 times as high as in 1940. Studies show that children are always better off economically, most often  and emotionally, with two parents in a household. From a policy perspective, should the government be doing anything to encourage family formation?SANTORUM: You know, weve had this debate about the economy, and we havent talked the one issue now increasingly even the right, and even the are coming to agreement. Ive run around doing 300 town hall meetings talking about a book written by a liberal Harvard sociologist, not a normal thing for me to be talking about, but I now name Robert Putnam who wrote a book called, Our Kids.And, he wrote this book, I think, ostensibly to support the Democratic argument that the middle of Americas hollowing out, and income gap is widening, and rich are getting richer. When he studied all the information as to what was going on, he realized that the biggest reason that were seeing the hollowing out of the middle of America is the breakdown of the American family.The reality is that if youre a single parent  a child of a single parent, and you grew up in a single parent family neighborhood, you went to that single parent family school, the chance of you ever, ever reaching the top 20% of income earners is 3% in America. At least  I dont know about you, but thats not good enough. And, we have been too politically correct in this country because we dont want to offend anybody to fight for the lives of our children. (APPLAUSE)You want  You want to be shocked? You read the first few chapters of Mr.  Dr. Putnam book. He talks about Port Clinton, Ohio and growing up there in the 1950s, and how poor kids actually survived and did well, even though they were poor and disadvantaged. But, then he goes to the towns today and these kids are failing, and failing miserably. They dont even have a shot, and we wont even have the courage to have leadership at the federal level  not with legislation, but the most powerful tool a president have, the bully pulpit to encourage each and everyone of you, churches and businesses, and educators, and community leaders to lets have a national campaign to rebuild the American family, and give every child its birthright which is a Mom and a Dad who loves them.That will change this economy.(CHEERING & APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you.SMITH: Thank you, Senator.Were not finished yet. More Republican Presidential Debate in North Charleston after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)SMITH: Welcome back, its time for the closing statements. Candidates will each get one minute, starting with Senator Santorum.Thank you very much, I want to thank the people of Charleston, which has become a little bit of a second home to me, because I am very privileged to have two young men who go to the Citadel here and theyre here tonight, my son John and my son Daniel.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: Ladies and gentlemen, America is frustrated and angry and looking for someone whos a fighter, but I also think theyre looking for someone whos a winner. Somebody who can go out there and take on the establishment and make a difference. And take on someone whos going to be the person whos going to be between a Republican holding the presidency and thats Hillary Clinton.And theres one person on this stage, one person in the race whos done it and done it repeatedly. Ive taken on Hillary Clinton on the issues you care about. Partial-birth abortion.Go and google Rick Santorum and Hillary Clinton and there youll see a five-minute debate. Ill let you decide who won the debate. Ill tell you who won, because we passed the bill and I know Im out of time but Im going to take some of Rand Pauls time here for a second.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: If youre looking for someone who fought Hillary Clinton on Irans sanctions, she was one of four who voted  whos deciding vote who voted against Irans sanctions, so we didnt get it in place as earlier as we should have.Ive fought battles against her. In 1994, I ran against the Clinton machine. James Carville and Paul Begala, ran the race against me when I took on the author of Hillary care.And each one of those battles, I won. You want a fighter, you want a winner, Id appreciate your vote. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Thank you, Senator Santorum. Governor Mike Huckabee.HUCAKBEE: Well, Rick, Im pretty sure I did also fight the Clinton machine because every election I was ever in in Arkansas, I assure you, they were behind it, helping finance and campaign for every opponent.And I share with you the understanding that its going to be a tough battle. But I spent the first half of my adult life in the private and nonprofit sector, raising a family, understanding how tough it is for people to make it.And that first half of my life is what led me to believe that America needs a different kind of leadership, not people who spent their whole life running from one office to the next, and living off the government dime. And I got involved because I got sick of what I saw.I also believe that theres got to be some leadership that not only addresses the monetary and military issues of this country, but the moral issues of this country. At the end of every political speech, most of us say, God bless America.But how can he do that when we continue to slaughter 4,000 babies a day?(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: And I want to be the president that treats every person, including the unborn, as a person. And protect them under the 5th and 14th amendments of the constitution. I close with this word from a gentleman in East Texas named Butel Lucre (ph). Hes 100 years old and I met him down in East Texas.HUCKABEE: And he said this to me. I sure wish, Mike, we had the days when The Ten Commandments were in all of our capitals and in every school, and we prayed again.You know, he may be 100 years old, but I believe some of those old ideas to get this country back where we unapologetically get on our knees before we get on our feet might be the best solutions weve ever sought as a country.(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: And I ask for your support and your vote.Thank you.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Thank you, Governor.REGAN: Carly Fiorina?FIORINA: My husband Frank, that I mentioned, I love spending time with. Hes down there. He was real excited the other day because in New Hampshire, he was introduced as my eye candy.(LAUGHTER)FIORINA: You know, everybody out there watching knows this. You cannot wait to see the debate between me and Hillary Clinton. You would pay to see that fight.(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: And thats because you know I will win. And thats important. Weve got to start by beating Hillary Clinton.All of my life, I have been told to sit down and be quiet. Settle. Settle. Dont challenge the system.Thats what the American people are being told now and we have been told that for way too long  sit down and be quiet about our God, about our guns, about the abortion industry, settle for illegal immigration thats been a problem for decades, as so many of our problems have festered for decades. Accept a system of government and politics that no longer works for us.I will not sit down and be quiet. And neither will you.So I ask you to stand with me, fight with me, vote for me, citizens. It is time to take our future back, time to take our politics back. It is time to take our government back. Citizens, it is time. We must take our country back.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you to all the candidates.(CROSSTALK)REGAN: That does it, everyone for the first debate right here in North Charleston.In just about two hours from now, at 9:00 p.m. Eastern seven more candidates are going to be taking to this stage.'
